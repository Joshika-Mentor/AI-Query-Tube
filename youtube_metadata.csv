fPopFeqw5sk,Learn NumPy data types in 8 minutes! 💱,2025-11-21T15:40:45Z,"Yo, hello again everybody. In this video, I'm going to explain what the dtype is in numpy. DT type, it's a keyword argument. It tells NumPy the kind of values that you're going to store in an array. If you don't set the dype, numpy guesses the best data type based on your data. By manually setting the dype, it improves performance and is more memory efficient, especially when working with larger data sets. Here are a few of the more beginnerfriendly data types for NumPy. We have integers int 8 through int 64. The number after int represents the number of bits allocated to store that number. The higher the number, the more memory that's used. We have floats, float 16 through float 64, booleans, strings, and objects. You'll want to be cautious with objects. More on that later. Let's go over a few examples. After importing numpy as np, we will create an array. array equals a numpy array with just a few digits. How about the numbers one through five? Now I will print my array. You can get the d type that's a property. Access my array then access the d type. The dtype of my array is int 64. If you don't specify a d type explicitly, numpy is going to guess what the best data type will be. We're using 64 bits to hold each number. Then to display the number of bytes that your array uses, I'm going to use an F string. I'll add a placeholder, but I will take my array access n bytes for the number of bytes. And I will display the word bytes. My array it uses 40 bytes. The d type is int 64. 8 bits is one bite. Eight bytes times five elements, that's 40. If I were to add another six, I bet the number of bytes is going to be 48, which it is. To manually set the dype to something else, we'll pass in a keyword argument. When we create an array, we will set the dype equal to access numpy. Then choose a new data type. Instead of using in 64, we'll use int32, which uses up 32 bits instead of 64 bits. So now the d type is int32 and my array is using 20 bytes rather than 40. Since we only have five elements, it's not going to make too much of a difference. But imagine if you had like 1 million elements, reducing the amount of memory by half is greater then. Or we could use int 16 for 16 bits. Now our array is 10 bytes or even int 8. Now our array takes up five bytes. Be careful though cuz you can only store a number so big. Depending on the number of bits that you're using, there is a maximum size. Int 8 is very small. We can only store a number up to 127. Just to demonstrate, we'll change some of these numbers around. 126 127 128. We have an overflow error. Python integer 128 is out of bounds for int 8. Anything 128 or above is too big because that uses more than 8 bits, but in 16 would work. Let's change that to int 16. That appears to be enough space. Here's a little chart on the screen to display the minimum and maximum values that each of these integer data types can hold. The higher the bit number, the more memory you're going to use. Let's change these numbers back to 1 through 5. Let's explore floatingoint numbers. I'll set the dtype to be float 64. Here are my floatingoint numbers. Each of them has a decimal point afterwards. The type is float 64. We're using 64 bits for each number. And my total array is using up 40 bytes. Here's float 32. We're using 20 bytes. We still have a bunch of floatingoint numbers and float 16. And we're using 10 bytes. Now, for booleans, the data type is going to be bool, then an underscore. If you don't include that underscore, that's a Python boolean. But bool with an underscore afterwards, that's a numpy boolean. So my numbers converted to boolean would give me all true values. So anything that's non zero when converted to a boolean, it's going to be true. If I were to add a zero, that's going to be false. Any nonzero number converted to a boolean is true. Then we have strings, which is str My numbers are now converted to strings. In the DT type, it's actually little Indian u for unic code and then one. This data type, it's for a fixed length unicode string. The length of these numbers is one character. If these were two characters, I'll just add some zeros to the end of each number. Well, then the number of characters is two. Let's change that back. Basically, numpy will promote this generic string type into a fixed size unicode string. Rather than numbers, I'll put some strings within here. Apple, orange, banana. For the data type of my fixed length unicode string, the number of characters allowed is six. It's based on which element uses the most amount of characters, which would be banana. Well, I guess orange has six characters, too, but Apple only has five. You could explicitly set the dype to a fixed length unicode string to limit the amount of characters. As a string, you would type less than u. Then let's say four characters. Here's what's within my array. Now, any characters beyond four get truncated. We have apple, orin banana. That's how you can limit the number of characters in a string within a numpy array. And then we have objects. That would be object underscore. So be cautious when working with objects. Operations fall back to Python, not NumPy's optimize C code. We lose those speed advantages when working with Python objects. So this does allow you to mix and match data types. Like I'll put true within here. I'll put a string and then a floatingoint number. You can mix and match data types, but you do lose your numpy speed boost. Creating a numpy array of objects could be necessary when working with custom classes, datetime objects, or you're planning on converting it to pandas later. Now, if you want to convert from one data type to another after already creating your array, you can call the as type function. Currently, I have an array of integers. I'll convert them to be floatingoint numbers. We're going to reassign our array. Take our array, then call the as type function, then pass in a new data type. I'll convert my integers to be float 16. And here's what we have now. We have floatingoint numbers. The data type is float 16 and we're using 10 bytes. Or if these are originally floatingoint numbers, let's say 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5. I'm going to delete that temporarily. We have some floatingoint numbers. Float 64. Let's convert them to be integers. array as type pass in a new type int 16. So that decimal portion gets truncated. The data type is in 16 and we're using up 10 bytes. All right everybody, that is dtype and numpy. Passing in a keyword argument of dtype tells numpy what's going to be stored within this array. What's their data type? And using the as type function, you can always convert it to another data type later. And well everybody, that is the dtype keyword argument in numpy."
xf71dRBRP6o,Build a music player with Python! 🎶,2025-11-20T16:51:00Z,"What is going on everybody? In this video, I thought it'd be pretty fun to walk you through how to create an MP3 player using Python, assuming you have some MP3 files to work with. I have a folder called music. And within it, I have a few MP3 files. If you do need some MP3 files to work with, you can always go to YouTube's audio library and download some for non-commercial use. But here are a few songs that I picked. Now, what I'm going to do is take my music folder. You can name it something else if you want to. And I will drag and drop it into my project folder. The same one that contains my main Python file. Let's start off with some imports. We will import the OS module. The OS module interacts with the operating system. We're also going to use Pygame. Import Pygame. If Pygame is underlined red, you can hover over it, then click install package. Pygame. Pygame [clears throat] has a built-in audio mixer and it's really convenient to use. Now, another option is within your terminal to install Pygame. You would type pip install Pygame. But it looks like it has already worked. Now, when creating a program, I like to add the following line of code. If dunder name is equal to a string of dunder main. If so, we will call a main function, which we still need to declare. This line of code checks to see if we're running our main Python file directly or if it's being imported as a module in another script. We're going to be running this file directly. We need to define a function of main. Define main. This is where we'll have our main body of code within the main function. What we'll do within the main function first when we start our program we're going to initialize pygame audio mixer we will access pygame access its mixer then call the init function to initialize it. Basically mixer is a pygame module for loading and playing sounds. Now if you would like you can surround this with a try block. Try and initialize the audio mixer. If we encounter an exception except pygame error, we'll give it an alias as e. We'll print something like audio initialization failed. And we can print the error message too which we've named as e. Then we will return to exit the main function. Now, if we were to run this within our output, we have a Pygame support prompt. This is kind of annoying. You can actually suppress it. Here's how. After importing the operating system, but before importing Pygame, we can access the OS module. Then access environment, which is shortened to E N VI O N subscript operator pi game_hide support_prompt. We will set this to a string of hide. And that should hide that support prompt, which it does. Yeah, it's kind of annoying that you have to do this. I wish we didn't have that support prompt. Anyways, our audio mixer is initialized. What can we do now? I'm going to create a variable, a folder. It's going to contain a name, the name of our folder. Mine is music, but yours might be something different depending on what you named it. Folder equals a string of music. If we're working with file paths, I can use this folder as a variable. Now, we'll check to see if this folder doesn't exist. If so, we'll print a message. You can write the following. Let me scroll down a little bit. If not, access OS access path then call the is dur function. Path is a module within the OS library. is dur returns true if the file path we pass in exists. So if we were to take our variable folder and pass that in. If this folder exists, then we'll return true. But we're using if not if this folder doesn't exist, what do you want to do? We'll print a message. We'll print I'll use an fring folder. Then insert the folder variable not found. I'll put this within single quotes too. And then return to exit the main function up here. I do have a folder called music. Currently if I run this program, nothing happens, which is good. But let's say that the folder doesn't exist or I misspel the string. music with an extra C. Well, the folder of music with two C's wasn't found. So, that's how you can use the is there function to check to see if a folder or directory exists. Now, within this folder, we have to get all the MP3 files. Here's how. This will be a list, a list of MP3 files. We'll name the list mp3 files equals a list comprehension. So with the list comprehension, I like to start with the for loop portion first. For every file in then we'll access the library of os call the list dur function. Then pass in our folder. list all the files within our folder. But we'll add an if statement. If the file then call the function of ends with ends with the file extension of MP3. If so, return that file. So basically we're saying for every file in this folder of music, if it's an MP3 file, which they are, return that file. So just to test it, I'm going to print I will print my MP3 files. And here they are. I have five MP3 files. If there are no MP3 files, we can print a message. We'll say if not MP3 files. If this list is empty, then let's print no MP3 files found. Just temporarily, I'm going to move these MP3 files to my project folder. I want this folder to be empty for testing purposes. All right, let's run this. No MP3 files found. If our folder doesn't contain any MP3 files, we get this message. Let's put those files back. Moving on to part two. We have a list of MP3 files. I will create a while loop. While true. This will contain the main loop of our program. If we ever want to exit, we can break to break out of the loop. Within my loop, I will print. I'll add some text decoration. Just a few asterisks. MP3 player, a few asterisks again. And then print my song list. Here we're going to output all of our songs and we'll use the enumerate function for every index, song in enumerate. So what the enumerate function does, enumerate returns an enumerate object. It's an iterator. And when you get the next element in this sequence, it'll return a tpple. It'll return a number to enumerate something and the next item in the sequence. So we're going to enumerate our MP3 files as well as a number which will serve as the index. Normally it starts at zero but we'll set that to start at one. So pass in a keyword argument of start equals 1. Now within this loop we'll use a print statement. We will print we'll use an fstring print the index a period then insert the song the song name. So now when we run this then just temporarily I'm going to break because currently we're stuck in an infinite loop with no way to escape. We'll put that in for testing purposes. So when we run this we should get a list of our songs. I have five songs. Each of these songs is enumerated because we've used the enumerate function. We have an index and a song name. Now, if we didn't use the enumerate function, it would look something like this. For every song in MP3 files, output each song. So, you could write it that way, but I like including those numbers, the index number. We'll need them later anyways. Okay, let's no longer break. We're going to accept some user input. We'll say choice input equals call the input function. New line enter the song number to play. Or if the user wants to quit, we'll say or capital Q to quit colon space. Looks like I misspelled input. If the user wants to exit, we have to check to see if this variable is a capital Q. We can use an if statement. If choice input dot call the upper function just in case they type in a lowercase Q we'll make it uppercase is equal to a character of capital Q. That means the user wants to quit. If so let's print a goodbye message by and break to break out of the infinite loop. Okay let's test it. MP3 player my song list. Enter the song number to play or Q to quit. You know what? I just want to quit. I will press Q. I can do lowercase Q or capital Q. And we print by and we exit the program. Good. We can at least escape that loop. Let's say the user doesn't type in a song number or the letter Q. Let's check to see if the choice input is not a digit. If not choice input, we can check to see if this is a digit. Call the is digit method where we will print enter a valid number. Then we can use continue. Break will break out of the loop. Continue will skip one cycle. If the user's choice is not a digit, do this. We'll test it. Enter song number to play or Q to quit. Um, I'm going to type in P for pizza. Enter a valid number. And then we have that prompt again. We have to enter something valid here. We'll choose a song number. This will be a variable of choice. Choice equals. Now our choice input it's a string because when you accept user input it's a string. We'll convert it to be an integer using explicit type casting. So take your choice input and type cast it to an integer. Now take a look at this. Let's say I want the first song number one that has an index of zero and the next song would have an index of one. So on and so forth. We're going to subtract one from our choice input. The song number doesn't match with the index number. By subtracting one, it will. We have to see if the numbered choice falls within that range of songs that we have. within an if statement. If zero is less than or equal to our choice and is it less than call the length function the length of our list of MP3 files. I have five files within this list. So if my choice falls between zero and four, then we'll play a song. But if it's outside that range, we won't. For now, I'm going to pass else. We're trying to play something outside of that range. We'll print invalid choice. Let's test it. We have song numbers 1 through 5. I'll play song number 42069. Invalid choice. And we get our prompt again. Okay, let's type in something serious. I'll type in one. Okay, nothing appears to happen. That's good. Here's where we'll play some music. So rather than pass, we're going to call a function, but we still need to define that function. We're going to call a function of play music. We'll pass in our folder as well as pass in our list of MP3 files. subscript operator the numbered choice. So if choice is zero, we're passing in the first item within our list. Or if choice was one, that would be the next item. So now we have to define this function of play music. So scrolling back to the top before our main function, we can actually collapse this. We're going to define a function of play music. We're passing in two arguments, folder and a song name. The parameters will be folder, song name. We'll combine them both folder and song name. We'll name it file path equals access the library of OS access the module of path. Then call the join function. We're going to join our folder and our song name. Basically we're concatenating our folder name and our song name. It'll be a lot easier for us to work with these songs if we need to access them. For some reason, if this file path doesn't exist, if not access the library of OS access path, then call the exists function. If this file path doesn't exist because we're using not. If this file path doesn't exist, we'll print file not found. then return to return to our main function. Just temporarily for testing purposes, let's take out not and say file found. I would like the first song. I'll type in one, hit enter. File found. Okay, that's good. So, we're checking if that file doesn't exist. So, undo those changes. At this point, we have a valid file path. We're going to use Pygame audio mixer to load that file. We'll access Pygame, then access our mixer, access music, then call the load function, then pass in that file path. Then we're going to play that file after loading it. piameixer dot music. Then call the play function to play it. We will print I'll use an fstring. I'll add a new line. Now playing colon space. We will insert our song name. We don't want to display the full file path when showing the song that we're playing. We're going to use the song name, not file path. And then we'll add a few commands. Print commands. A user is going to be able to pause, capital P for pause, comma, space. We'll do capital R for resume. Resume after pausing that is and S S for stop. Okay, let's see if we can play a song. Uh I will play song number how about four. All right, it's working. And then we'll stop it by pressing this red square because we have no way to actually stop it yet. All right, we'll create a loop. While true, we could do the following commands and just break if we want to exit. We will assign a variable of command equals accept user input. Now for the prompt. For the prompt I'm going to use a greater than sign space. Then with our input we will call the upper function to make it uppercase in case the user types in one of these letters lowercase. We'll just convert it to be uppercase to make it easy. So a user can pause resume and stop. We can use a few if statements for that. So within our while loop if command is equal to a capital P then pygame domixer domusic call the pause function to pause the song and we'll print paused. else if our command is equal to R they want to resume and I'll just copy this line of code we're going to unpause then print resumed else if our command is s they want to Stop pygame.mmixer domusic call the stop function. Then we will print stopped and return. We need return so we can break out of this while loop. Anything else is an invalid command. else print invalid command. And that should be everything. Let's test it. Okay. MP3 player. My song list. Enter the number song to play. I'll start with one. I'm going to pause. I'll press P. The song is paused. I'll resume again by entering R. Now I'm going to stop by pressing S. Okay. And we're back to the main menu. I'll pick a different song. I'll pick number two. Oh yeah, that's my jam. All right. Now I'm going to pause, then resume, and then stop. Let's try number five. Pause. Resume. Pause. Resume. Stop. And Q to quit. Bye. All right, everybody. That is how you can create an MP3 player using Python."
k0D3MQwLn7A,Learn Python iterators in 7 minutes! ➡️,2025-11-10T14:21:48Z,"Hey, what is going on everybody? In this video, I'm going to explain Python iterators in just a few minutes. An iterator is an object that returns elements one at a time from a sequence or other data stream. It remembers its position between calls. A Python object, it's considered an iterator if it follows the iterator protocol, meaning it has these two methods, dunder itter and dunder next. All dunder itter does is that it returns itself and dunder next it's going to be in charge of returning the next item in the sequence and it raises a stop iteration exception when there's no more items to return. So in this demonstration we're going to create a class of dice class dice. We need a constructor define dunder init. We'll have one parameter besides self rolls. How many dice would we like to roll? We'll need to assign our rolls self.rolls equals the amount of rolls we receive. We will also have an internal attribute of count to keep track of how many dice we have already rolled, which we will set to zero initially. We need to implement these two methods in order for this class to create iterator objects. So dunder it, all it's going to do is return itself. We have no parameters besides self. All this method does is return self. Basically, when we use this class to create an object and assign it, we'll implicitly behind the scenes call this method. More on that in a moment. Then we need dunder next. This method is in charge of returning the next item in a sequence. There's many different ways in which we can implement this method. Let's do the following. Let's say if self.count, count. How many dice have we already rolled? Initially, it's zero. If the count is less than the number of rolls, the number of dice we have to roll self.rolls, we will roll some dice within an if statement. But first, we will increment count self.ount plus equals 1. And then return a random dice roll. Random. We'll need to import this module. import this name of random. So be sure to include import random at the top. Return random.rand int between 1 through six. This will return a random number between 1 through 6. When we call dunder next, we're returning a random number. Now if we want to stop, we need to raise a stop iteration exception. We'll handle that within an else statement. else we will raise a stop iteration exception and that's all we have to do our class of dice will create iterator objects those objects will have these two methods done it and dunder next let's test it I will create a dice object dice equals call the constructor for dice how many dice do we want to roll I'll pass in three to roll three dice our dice object. It's an iterator. It has these two methods and it's also iterable, meaning I can use it in a for loop. For every dice in dice, I will print each dice. Let's test it. I have three random dice rolls. 611, 653, 311. If you would like, you can also use a list comprehension. Here's how. Let's say we have dice. Dice equals a list comprehension. I like to start with the for loop. For every dice in called the dice constructor, I'll pass in three dice. Then we need an expression. I'll keep the expression the same as the loop variable of die. Return each die for every die in our dice. And then if I were to print my list of dice, I should have a list with random dice rolls. Here we have 533. Maybe I'll pass in one more. Four dice. 4 6 4 6. Now you're probably wondering how are these two methods called? We didn't call them explicitly at all. So here's what's actually going on. When we run this program, the Python interpreter, it's going to translate these higher level operations into lower level operations. Behind the scenes within the Python interpreter, this program is going to be translated into something like this. You don't have to write this down, but do pay attention. Our program is being translated into something similar to this. We're rolling three dice. Dice equals call the dice constructor. Let me move down a little bit. We have an iterator object equals. Then there's an iter function and then we're passing in our dice object. The iter function, what it does, it looks within this dice object and calls the dunder function. This is no different from this dice. Then there's going to be some sort of while loop while true. And then within a try block we will assign a role. Roll ro equals a next function pass in our iterator. The next function it looks within this object and calls the dunder next function. That would be the same as us writing iterator.dunder next. But we don't have to write it that way. And then we will print each role. We do need an accept block. except stop iteration then break to break out of our while loop. So this program is going to run the same. We have three random dice rolls. But we don't have to write it this way with our original Python program. It's translated into a program similar to this that uses lower level operations. Behind the scenes within our Python interpreter, we're calling dunder itter and dunder next. But again, we don't need to write it this way. We can write it the original way. Our higher level operations are being translated in the Python interpreter into lower level operations which are explicitly calling these methods. All right, everybody. Those are iterators in Python. They're Python objects that return elements in a sequence one at a time. For a Python object to be considered an iterator, you need these two methods. Dunder and dunder next. And well everybody, those are iterators in Python."
ZBlxaXMN_hU,Learn Python generator expressions in 9 minutes! ♻️,2025-11-07T15:08:16Z,"All right, everybody. In this video, I'm going to explain generator expressions in Python. A generator expression, it's similar to a list comprehension. We use a set of parenthesis rather than a set of straight brackets. A generator expression, it creates a generator. They're iterable. They yield values one at a time. And by using a generator expression, there's no need to define a function or use yield. However, they're less flexible than generator functions, and they can only be used once. they're not reusable. Basically, you follow this formula. It's very similar to a list comprehension. Within a set of parenthesis, you have some expression for every value in an iterable. In the last video, we've created a generator function that counts up to a certain number. It yields values one at a time rather than dumping all of the values at once like a normal function with return. Yield pauses the function, returns a value, then continues the function again. We're going to recreate a similar program but use a generator expression instead. Here's how. I'm going to delete this function. We'll accept some user input which I will name number. We're counting up to a certain number. We'll need some input. Input. Enter a number to count up. Then we will type cast this as an integer because normally user input is a string. All right. Now we'll write a generator expression. A generator expression, it returns an object. The object is iterable. So you can use it in a for loop. With our object name, let's name it counter. Counter equals a generator expression. You need a set of parenthesis. The formula is similar to a list comprehension expression for value in iterable. To best explain this, we'll start with the for loop portion. For every value for our loop variable, let's name it count. For every count in, then we need something iterable. We can use the range function. That's an option for the range of numbers between 1, our number, our user input. But we'll add plus one because this argument is exclusive, not inclusive. So if we need to count to 10, the range of numbers will be 1 comma 11 exclusive. Now we do need an expression. We can take our loop variable and do stuff with it before assigning it. We're not going to do anything with it. We'll just rewrite count for the expression. So al together count for count in then use the range function and this should work. So this is our generator expression. It's assigning an object. The object is iterable, so we can use it in a loop. For every number, um, but it looks like I already have a number variable. Let's rename this to something else. We'll just say n, n for short. For every n number in our counter, we will print each number of n. Let's test it. Enter a number to count up to. Let's count up to 10. There we go. 1 through 10. All right. Now, I'm going to count up to something ridiculous like a cajillion. And we're getting each value one at a time. But this is going to take forever. So, I'm going to terminate this program. But we know that it works with our generator expression. There's no need to define a function or use yield. However, a generator expression is less flexible with its logic because within a function, you can write some really complex stuff and these aren't reusable. They're not within a function. So, we can't call them repeatedly. Another great place to use a generator expression is when reading a file. Here's how we can do that. So, on my desktop in the previous video, we've created a test file that contains some sample text. I'm going to copy this file location. Right click, go to properties, copy this location. We'll need it. We will create a file path variable equal to within a string. Paste that file path. Include the file name and the extension. And we'll need to use double backslashes. There we go. All right. When opening and closing files, we'll want to use a width block. with call the open function. Then you can pass in that file path as file. The as keyword, it assigns a resource as a variable name, the file that we're opening. The width block will handle opening and closing any resources. Now, normally with a generator expression, it won't close any resources such as files automatically. That's why we're putting it within a width block. Now we need to write a generator expression. We'll say lines. Lines will be an object. The object that's returned to us via a generator expression. We need a set of parenthesis and then follow this formula. Expression for value in iterable. But I like to start with the for loop portion first. For every line in my iterable of file, my file is an iterable. Then we'll need an expression. What do we want to do with each line? I'm going to return each line. But we could write something more complex if we need to. For example, follow this with strip. This will strip any unnecessary white space. So that's our generator expression. We could use the object returned to us in the loop. for every line in my object of lines. We will print each line. And let's see if this works, which it does. Here are the contents of that text file. All right, here's a challenge round. Within your generator expression, you can add an if condition. If condition, we'll create a range of numbers and square all of them with a generator expression. We'll accept some user input. Number equals accept some user input. Enter a number to square up two. Then type cast this as an integer. We'll write a generator expression. It returns an object. This object will be squares. Then we'll write a generator expression for every value in iterable. We'll start with that portion. For every let's say for every x in my range of 1, our number + one. Then the expression we will take x then square it. x to the power of two and then we can print our squares. For every square in squares, print each square. Let's run it. Enter a number to square up to. Let's find all squares up to 10. So 1^2 is 1, 2 is 4, 32 is 9, 4 is 16, so on and so forth to 10, 10 squared is 100. Now we'll add an if condition. After the iterable, you can add an if condition. Let's return a value only if x is even. To check to see if a number is even, you can write the following code. If x modulus 2 modulus gives you the remainder of any division. If x is odd modulus 2 it returns 1. If it's even it returns zero. So if x modulus 2 equals z that means x is even in this case. Let's change the name of the object returned to us. We'll name this even squares. It only holds the squares of even numbers. Let's test that again. Enter a number to square up to 10 2 4 2 6 2 8 2 10 squared. So with a generator expression, you can add an if condition, too. All right, everybody. So those are generator expressions. They're similar to a list comprehension. They create a generator that yields values one at a time. And well everybody, those are generator expressions in Python."
c9vhHUGdav0,Learn Matplotlib in 1 hour! 📊,2025-10-09T14:01:03Z,"Hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to teach you everything you need to know to get started working with Mattplot Lib. So, I encourage you to sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Mattplot Lib is a Python library for creating charts and graphs. You can take plain numbers and turn them into visuals you can actually understand. With just a couple lines of code, you can make your first graph. Boom. Instant line graph. You can create line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and my favorite, pie charts, because I like pie. You can customize the appearance of what your charts look like, too. Here, I went a little crazy with the customization, but I think you get the idea. What I would recommend before starting the series, be familiar with all Python subjects up to dictionaries. Knowing numpy and pandas are helpful, but not necessary for this series. I do have some free courses on YouTube to catch you up to speed if you're interested. Anyways, let's begin. Oh yeah, let's do this. To start working with mattplot lib, we have to be sure that we have the library installed. One easy way to check that at the top of your IDE, if you were to import mattplot lib, if it's underlined red, you can hover your cursor over it and install the package by clicking this link. Now, if this popup doesn't appear, if you're using PyCharm, you can open up a terminal. Alt F12 is the shortcut. Then use pip to install Mattplot LIIB. pip install Mattplot LIIB. Enter. Give it a moment to install. And that's all you got to do. We can close out of this terminal. And that red underline should go away. To check the current version within a print statement, we will print access the library of mattplot lib dot dunder meaning double underscore version dunder. Again, the current version of mattplot lib that I'm using is 3.10.6. We can delete this print statement. There's a module called pipplot. It's found within the library of mattplot liib. It provides a userfriendly interface for plotting. We're going to import that module by following mattplot lib with pi plot. So al together import mattplot lib do import matt import mattplot.pipplot. That's a tongue twister. Just so we don't have to type this long name every time. We're going to give it an alias or nickname as plt for short. So in order to access here we go mattplot lib.pipplot. We're just going to give it a nickname of plt. Here's how we can create a basic plot. We'll need a set of x and ycoordinates. We'll start with a basic Python list. For the xcoordinates, we'll say x equals a python list. Here you can type in some numbers. I'm going to type in some years 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. And then for the y-coordinates, this will be a separate Python list. Make up some numbers. Uh in this scenario, let's pretend that we have different class sizes each year. Starting with 2023, there's a class size of 15 students. Then for 2024, we have 25 students, then 30 and 20. Feel free to pick different numbers if you would like. We have a list of x coordinates and a list of y-coordinates. Each set of these elements is a pair of x and y coordinates. We have to be sure that they match. Now to create a basic plot, we're going to access plt dot call the plot function and then pass in our coordinates x, y. The first argument is for the points on the xaxis. The second argument is for the coordinates on the y-axis. Now, if I were to run this, nothing displays. You also need to call the show function of your plot. Here's how. When we would like to show our plot, we will access plt call the show function in order to show our plot. Now I'm using PyCharm. My plot appears on the right hand side in a separate window called plots. Here's my x-axis with all of my years, but we'll have to do some customization in a future topic. Then here are all the y-coordinates. For 2023, we have 15. 2024 is 25. 2025 is 30. And 2026 is 20. And you can change these coordinates, too. I don't know. I'll set 30 to instead be a,000. Let's see what this looks like. And we get a different plot, but I'll change that back. You can also close out of past versions of plots by hitting this X button next to each. Now, for the plot function, if you only pass in a single parameter, this argument would be for points on the Y ais. And here's what that would look like. The default behavior for plot is to start at zero and place a point at each increment of one. 1 2 3. But each of these ticks, they increment by.5 each. The points on the xaxis will be provided to you. But we'll pass in both x and y. Now, if you're familiar with numpy, we could instead use numpy arrays because they're faster than python lists. To set that up, we will import numpy as np for short. We'll assign x to be a numpy array. nparray function and then pass in your Python list. Then do the same thing with y. nparray pass in your Python list. And that's all you have to do. Numpy arrays are faster than Python lists and give you more functionality. Your homework is in the comment section. either post two lists or two numpy arrays. Try and think of something creative if you can. All right, everybody. And that is an introduction to creating basic plots in mattplot lib. In this video, I'm going to show you how we can start customizing our plots. More specifically, we'll be customizing the lines and markers. Here's how. Within our plot function, we can pass one of a few keyword arguments. one of which is marker. Marker equals a given character. Depending on the character that you set for marker, your marker will be one of a few symbols. For example, if your marker set to be a period, a point, each set of coordinates has a point, although it's a little hard to see. I'll try and zoom in. You can see that each set of coordinates has a point. Another is circle. That would be an O. Triangle down is a V. For a star, you can use an asterisk. These are a few markers you can use, but not all of them. If you read the documentation, there's a fairly extensive list for our project. For the marker, we'll set it to be a dot, a period. But then you can change the marker size if this is too small. That will be a separate keyword argument. For the keyword argument of marker size, pick a size. Here's what 10 looks like. Here's 20. 30. What's a th00and look like? I'm curious. No, go back. Go back. Go back. We'll set it to be 30. For the marker size, it can be abbreviated to MS. MS meaning marker size. But for teaching purposes, I'll keep this as marker size just because it's easier to read and understand. Here's how to change the marker colors. This is a separate keyword argument. Marker face color. And here you can pick a color. You can select the name of a color. You can use RGB values, hexodimal values, or HSL values. Let's start with something simple like the name of a color such as cyan. The markers are now this color, cyan. But for better customization, I recommend looking up a color picker. So, here's a color picker that we could use. I would like a very specific shade of blue. Something like that's pretty good. I'll just select this hexadimal value. We're going to paste that hexadeimal value and rerun this program. And now we have a very specific shade of blue for the marker face color for this keyword. You can also shorten this to MFC. It's shorter but not as readable for a beginner. I'll keep it as is. Marker face color. Then for the edges, you can use marker edge color. I'll set it to be the same color, or you could pick a different color if you would like. We'll keep it the same. Now, the edges of each marker are the same color as the face. The abbreviated version of this word is M EC, in case you see it. Now, we'll start working with the lines. You can select a line style. The default is solid. Let's use a dashed line. Here's what it looks like. for the line. It's now dashed. Or we could do dotted dotted. We have a dotted line now. Or dash dot dash dot. It's a combination of dashes and dots. Or for no line, if you just want the points, the markers, you can set this to be none. Then we have no line, but let's set it to be solid. Solid. Here's how you can change the line width cuz right now it's fairly skinny. We will pass in a keyword argument of line width. Normally it's one, but here's what two looks like. I'll set this to be three. four. And I don't know what's 10 look like. That's a little too much. Let's set it to be four. Yeah, that's pretty decent. Here's how to change the line color. Set the color to be then pick a color. I'll use that color picker again. Let's see. I'll select something kind of dark blue like that. Copy and paste the color value. And here's what we got. Our line color is now a very specific shade. Now, let's say we have more than one line to customize. I'm going to create another numpy array. We'll rename y as y1. Plot x and y1. Then we will also have y 2. And I'll just do some copying and pasting. Y 2 will have some different values. Make up some values. I'll say, I don't know, 17, 23, 38, and I don't know, five. Again, your values don't have to be the same as mine. Feel free to pick some different numbers. We're plotting X and Y1, but we'll also plot X and Y 2. That set of coordinates. access plt. Call the plot function. Pass in x and y 2. So now we have two lines, but our second line doesn't have the same customizations as our first line. Here's one option, although I don't recommend it. You could copy and paste all of these keyword arguments and pass them in. This would work, although here's a much better option. You could instead create a dictionary with all of these keyword arguments. And then when we plot a line, we can just unpack our dictionary. Here's how we can do that. Let's create a dictionary which we'll name line style. This will equal call the dictionary function. To create a dictionary, we'll cut all of these keyword arguments and then place them within this dictionary function. Now we could just pass in this dictionary when we plot a line. We just have to unpack it using double asterisks. Unpack the line style dictionary. Then it's as if we're passing in all of these individual keyword arguments. We'll do this for the second line as well. unpack our line style dictionary and it's the same. Let's create a third line. We'll name this line Y3. This will be another numpy array. Make up some values 13, then 15, 20, and 30. Then we'll have to plot this line. Access plt. Call the plot function. pass in our new coordinates x and y3. Then we will unpack our dictionary of line style. Then we should have a third line, which we do. All of these lines are the same color. That's because with our dictionary of lines style, we've set all the colors to be the same, but you could pass in an individual color. Think of this as the default color for all lines if we use the line style dictionary. Another option is that we can cut this keyword attribute of color and then pass that as a separate keyword argument as well as the line style dictionary after unpacking it. So let's pass in a color then pick a color. I'll keep the first line to be blue. For the second line I'll pick a different color. Let's go with something green. That's good. We'll pass in a different color for the second line. Then for the third line, I'll pass in a color that's red. That's good. And now each of our lines has a different color. All right, everybody. So that is some basic plot customization. In the next video, we'll discuss labels. To help increase engagement with this video, comment down below what your favorite food is. And well everybody, that is an introduction to plot customization using Mattplot LIIB. All right, everybody. In this next section, we're going to customize various labels, our title, and the ticks of our chart. Here's how we can customize those. In this demonstration, I have various class sizes yearbyear, the years 2023 through 2026. These are all numpy arrays, but you can use Python lists, too. To set a title, we're going to access plt. Call the title function, and then we can pass in a title as a string. We'll set the title to be class size. Then we will run this, and we should have a title. class size. Although it's kind of small and hard to read. Here's how we can customize it further. We can pass in some keyword arguments. One of which is font size. To change the font size, I'll set that to be 20. Here's the new title. You can also change the font family, and it's just family. I'll pick Ariel. That's a professional looking font. You can set the font weight to be bold. Font weight equals the word bold. Let me make the title a little bit bigger. Let's say 25. That's better. Let's also set a color for our title. Color equals. Here you can pick the name of a color. You can use RGB values. You can use hexodimal values. I'll pick something kind of dark blue like that. I'll copy the hex value and then set the keyword argument of color to be that hexodimal value. And now our title should be a specific shade of blue. Now we'll set a label for the x-axis. We will access plt call the function of x label. We'll set the label to be year. And we should have a label on the x-axis for year. Although it's kind of small. We'll change the font size. We'll copy the font size from our title, but set it to be 20. Here's the new font size. Let's change the font family. I'll pick Ariel again. I'll set the font weight to be bold. And then I'll pick a color. I'll pick a lighter shade of blue. Let's try that. Color equals that specific shade of blue. Yeah, not bad. The label is kind of close to the border. We'll be adjusting the margin a little bit later in this topic. To create the label on the Y-axis, I'm just going to copy everything within this X label function. Paste it. Change X to Y. We'll say the text will be let's change the text of the label to be students as in number of students. We should have a similar label on the Y ais. Now we're going to customize the ticks of our graph. Each of these ticks is incrementing by.5 each. You can kind of see that here. You can force ticks to only display at these values for the x-axis. Here's how. We'll access plt. Call the x tick function. x tick. then pass in our list or numpy array that we're using for the x-axis. So now we have ticks only at each given year 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026. Now to customize the ticks, we will access PLT call the tick params function, meaning tick parameters. To select an axis, you'll select the keyword argument of access. You can select X, you can select Y, or you can select both. We'll select both. We're going to select colors plural, not singular. I'll select the same color as my labels. Now, the ticks should be blue. All right, everybody. So, that is how to add various labels to your plots in Mattplot Lib. Hey everybody, I have a super quick video today on how to create grid lines using the grid function using Mattplot LIIB. The grid function creates grid lines. They help make plots easier to read by adding reference lines. We'll need some sample data to work with. We'll just make something up. On the xaxis, we'll have 1 2 3 4 5. On the y-axis, we'll have 5 10 15 20 25. It really doesn't matter. We're more focused on the grid lines today. We'll need a plot access plt. Call the plot function. Pass in x. Pass in y. Then access plot. Call the show function to show our plot. Here's our sample plot. Now, let's say you would like to create some grid lines. For better readability, here's how. We're going to access plt call the grid function. Let's see what happens if we don't pass in any arguments. These are the grid lines with no customization. We have grid lines on the x-axis and the y-axis. If you would just like a single axis, you can specify that with the keyword argument axis equals. We'll pick the x-axis to begin with. We will only have vertical lines then on the x-axis by setting the axis to x. If we were to set this to y, we would have grid lines on the y-axis. You can change the line width. Line width equals. Normally, it's one, but here's two. The lines are a little bit thicker. Here's three. Let's set that back to two. You can change the color. Color equals, then select a color. I'll just pick light gray to keep it simple. The lines are now light gray. You can specify a line style. Normally, it's solid. Let's try dashed. Here's dashed. Here's dotted. Here's dash dot. But let's set this back to dashed. All right, everybody. That is a super quick lesson on how to create grid lines using mattplot lib. All right, everybody. For this topic, we're going to create a bar chart. A bar chart compares categories of data by representing each category with a bar. Here's an example that I thought of. You know the food pyramid? We'll create a bar chart to represent daily consumption of categories of foods. Here are the different categories. This will be a Python list. Categories equals. We'll create a Python list. The first element within this list will be grains such as bread. Then fruit, vegetables, protein, dairy, and sweets. We'll create another Python list of values for each of these categories. What value should each of them have? Let's pretend that these values are for daily servings. How many in each category did I consume today? We'll make up some numbers. For grains, this will be four. Fruit, three. Vegetables, I don't eat very many vegetables, that will be two. Lots of protein, that's a five. Dairy, three. And sweets, one. But feel free to make up your own numbers. Now, although it's not necessary, I'm going to convert these Python lists to be numpy arrays. All right, we are ready to make a bar chart. Categories will be on the xaxis, values will be on the y-axis. Rather than using a plot such as plt called the plot function, we're instead going to use bar to make a bar chart. First pass in what's going to be used for the x-axis categories, comma, then the y-axis of values. And then you do have to show your bar chart. plt call the show function. And let's see what we have. Here we go. A bar chart compares categories of data by representing each category with a bar. Here are the categories that we've stated. grains, fruit, vegetables, protein, dairy, sweets. And here are the values on the lefth hand side for each. Let's add a title and two labels to our bar chart. PLT call the title function, then pass in a title as a string. We'll say daily consumption. Let's make sure that works. Yes, it does. We'll add a label to the x-axis. plt x label. We'll say the word food. Yep, it says food. And you can change the size if you want for these labels, but that might be overkill for this lesson. We've already covered that in the previous topic. PLT call the Y label function. We'll pass in a string that says quantity and it should say that on the lefth hand side. Now let's change the color of our bar chart. When we call the bar function, we can set the color to be a color of your choice. You can pick a color name. You can use hexodimal values. I'll just say sky blue. And the bar colors should change. Now, if you would like a horizontal bar chart, I'll comment this line of code out. Copy it, paste it, you're going to instead call the bar H function for a horizontal bar chart, which looks a little something like this. But honestly, for me, I prefer the vertical bar chart. All right, everybody. So that is how to create a basic bar chart using mattplot lib. All right everybody we are now going to create a bar chart using mattplot liib. A bar chart it's a circular chart divided into slices to show percentages of the total. It's good for visualizing distribution among categories. In this demonstration, we're going to create a fictional college. There will be four classes, freshman, sophomore, junior, senior. We'll create a Python list of categories. We'll have freshman, sophomores, I think I misspelled that, juniors, and seniors. We'll also create a Python list of the number of students in each class. Values equals a Python list. We'll have 300 freshmen in our college, 250 sophomores, 275 juniors, and 225 seniors. If you're familiar with numpy, you do have the option to convert any numerical Python lists to numpy arrays. Although for a list of four values, it's not really too beneficial. If this were a larger data set, we would benefit from numpy arrays more, but it would be a good habit for us to develop. Now, Python list of strings don't really benefit from numpy arrays. We'll keep that as is. We have the two collections that we need, categories and values. To create a pie chart, we will access plt, call the pi function, pass in our values. Let me show you what just passing in values will look like. We will also call the show function. plt.show function. We do have the distributions, but we don't have any labels. Here's how to set the labels. When we call the pi function, we will pass in a few keyword arguments. The first will be labels. What are the labels of our pie chart? The labels will be the categories that we have. Labels equals categories. And we should have some categories for each of these pie slices. Freshman, sophomores, juniors, seniors. You can add some percentages to each of these pie slices. Here's how. That's going to be another keyword argument. The keyword argument is auto PCT. This means auto percentage. We have to set this equal to a formatting instruction. We're going to use percent one f. Let's see what we have. All right. We don't need all these digits after the decimal. Let's limit that. After one, we'll add 0.1 to display one digit after the decimal. 28.6 23.8 8 26.2 21.4. To add a percent sign after, we'll use double percent signs cuz normally using one percent sign is a format specifier. Okay, now there's a percent sign after each of these numbers. Here's how to set the colors for each pie slice. We'll create another list for convenience, which I will name colors. Colors equals. Then in order of your categories, place a color within here. You can choose a color name, RGB values, hexodimal values. We'll just keep it simple and pick some color names. Freshman will be red, sophomores will be yellow, juniors will be blue, seniors will be green. And then we do have to pass that in as a keyword argument. Set colors equal to our list of colors. And the colors should change. Freshman are red, sophomores are yellow, juniors are blue, seniors are green. Let's add a title to our pie chart. PLT called the title function. Pass in a title. My college will be named Broode College because I think I'm cool. You can explode one of these pie slices. Explode means to displace it slightly. If you need to highlight a pie slice, we'll explode seniors. For the keyword argument of explode, we'll set this equal to a Python list. We have four categories. We'll need four values. I'll set each of these to be zero. I need to explode seniors. I'll set this to a value that's not one. Let's start with 0.1. The greater the number, the further the distance that pi slice will explode. Here's 0.1. Let's change that to 0.2. The distance traveled should be a little bit greater. Here's.3. We'll set that to be 02. That's pretty good. And 0.1. We can also add a drop shadow. shadow equals true. And there should be a drop shadow for each pie slice. To rotate your pie chart, you'll set start angle to be some angle. If I were to set this to be 180 for 180°, my pie chart is going to rotate by 180°. I'll just set that to be let's check out 90. That's pretty good. All right, everybody. So that is how to create a basic pie chart using mattplot liib. All right everybody in this video we're going to discuss scatter graphs in mattplot lib. Scatter graphs show the relationship between two variables. They help to identify a correlation positive negative or no correlation. For example the more hours you study the higher your test scores tend to be. That's a positive correlation. Scatters help us identify those correlations. In this demonstration, I'll create the following data set. You can either follow along and type what I'm about to type or look in the comment section. I'll try and post this data set. We'll have X, which will be a Python list. These will be hours studied for various students. We'll have 10 values. The first student didn't study at all. They studied zero hours. Another studied 1 hour. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8. Feel free to make up some numbers too. It really doesn't make a difference. Then y will be the test scores. This will be another Python list. The student that didn't study at all, they got a 55% on their test score. The first value will be 55. Then another got 60. 65. 62. 68 70 75 78 82 85 87. That's good enough for now. To create a scatter graph, we're going to access PLT. Call the scatter function. Pass in X. Then pass in Y. X is for the hours studied. Y is for the grades. What grade did they get on their test score? Then in order to show this graph, we have to call the show function. plt.show function. Let's see what we have. Here is our scatter graph. You can see that there's a positive correlation between our studied and the exam scores. Let's add some labels to our scatter graph. For the X label access plt, call the X label function. Then pass in a string to serve as the label. Hours studied is good. Let's make sure that that works. Yes, it does. We have a label for hours studied. For the y-axis, call the y label function. Then pass in a string. We'll say grades or grade singular. Let's make sure that that works. Yes, it does. Here's the grade. Then let's add a title plt. Call the title function. I'm going to say test scores just as a general title for our scatter graph. Let's add a little bit of customization. Let's change the color. This will be a keyword argument. color equals some color. You can pick a color name. You can use RGB values. I'll just say sky blue to keep it simple. And the color should change, which it does. You can also change the alpha. Alpha is related to the transparency. If I set alpha to be 0.5, that's 50%. The transparency is going to change, although it's a little hard to see. If I set alpha to be 0.1, then the transparency is 10% and you can barely see it. I'll keep it at 50%. Let's change the size of our dots on our scatter graph. That would be S for size. Let's check out 100. That's bigger. Here's 200. Yeah, we can keep it at 200. That's a good size. Okay, let's create another data set. The following set of scores will be for one class. We'll add another class of scores. Although it's not necessary, I forgot to make these numpy arrays. You can if you would like. Let's rename x to be x1, y to be y1. Pass in x1, and y1. We're going to create a whole another set. Let's copy and paste x1 and y1. Rename them as X2 and Y2. And let's change some of these values around. For the second set, we'll have 0 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. Then for the exam scores for the second class, we'll have 50 58 65 70 72 78 83 88 92 95 97. We're going to call the scatter function again. We'll copy and paste what we had previously, but pass in X2 and Y2, the second set of coordinates. Let's change the color to be red. The blue set of dots is for class one. The red set of dots is for class 2. Based on this graph, we can't tell without a legend. The legend will tell you which class is which. But we'll need some labels. We'll pass those in as keyword arguments. For class one, we'll set label equal to class A. And then for our second class, this will be class B. Label equals class B. But then we have to show the legend because it's not visible. Access PLT. Call the legend function. Then we should have a legend within our scatter graph. Class A is the blue dots. Class B is the red dots. All right, everybody. So those are scatter graphs. They show relationships between two variables. For example, hours studied and exam grades. The more hours you study, the better grade you tend to get. That's a positive correlation, which we can see from this graph here. And well everybody those are scatter graphs using mattplot liib. Yo hey everybody in this video I'm going to explain histograms in mattplot lib. Histograms are a visual representation of the distribution of quantitative data. In short we can visualize the distribution of data. Histograms group values into bins. Think of these like intervals. will count how many fall in each range in each bucket or bin. Histograms are great for statistics and probability. In many cases, you'll see a bell curve distribution. Now, in this demonstration, I recommend using NumPy cuz we'll need a lot of data to work with. With NumPy, we can generate some random numbers. Here's how we can do that. We're going to create some test scores. We're a teacher and we have 100 students that each took a test. We'll create a visual to display the distribution of scores. We'll create a numpy array of scores. Scores equals np accessis random. Then call the normal function for a normal distribution. There's a few keyword arguments here we'll pass in. The first is loc. LOC equals loc is the location of the center, the median of our data. For the center, we'll say that the median is 80 80%. All of the test scores are going to cluster around this score of 80. Most students will do pretty well. If this were a lower score like 50, that means most of the students failed. That's because the most frequent score is going to be around 50%. We'll set that to be 80. Now, we'll need a scale. This is another keyword argument. Scale equals scale is the standard deviation, the spread. How far away are the scores going to deviate from the center? The higher the number, the greater the deviation. Let's start with 10. And then we need a size. How many numbers do we want to generate? We'll set size equal to 100. We have 100 test scores. Let's test what we have currently. We'll access plt. Call the hist function for a histogram. Pass in our numpy array of scores. Then we do have to call the show function to show our histogram. access plt called call the show function. Here's what a histogram looks like. We set the center to be 80. Scores around that number are going to be the most frequent. And we've set the scale to be 10. 10 is the standard deviation. That's a statistics and probability term. How far away will the scores deviate from the center? Now, if I set the scale to be a small number like one, the scores are going to cluster more closely to 80. The lowest score was 77. The highest score was 82. If I set scale to be a big number, like 50. Well, then the scores really deviate from the center of 80. We have some students that scored below zero and others above 200. Let's set that back to 10. Just to ensure that no scores go below zero or above 100, we can use the clip function. We'll reassign our numpy array of scores. Access numpy. Call the clip function. We have to pass in our numpy array of scores. For any scores below zero, we'll set them to be zero. We'll clip them. For any scores above 100, we'll clip them down to 100. It's kind of like we're setting the bounds, the minimum and the maximum. All scores below zero will be set to zero. All scores above 100 will be set to 100. Let's set the scale back to something massive like 50. Yep, there's no scores below zero and no scores above 100. But we don't need a scale that big. Let's add some customization. You can set the number of bins that you want as another keyboard argument. This will be within the hist function for a histogram. I'll set the number of bins to be 10. We should now have 10 bins or intervals. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. If I were to set this to 20, we would now have 20. But I think 10 is a good number. Let's change the color. That's another keyword argument. Color equals pick a color. I'll just set my histogram to be light green. There we go. To better define the edges, you can set an edge color because right now it kind of looks like one massive blob. Edge color equals I'll set it to be black. We should get a nice outline around each interval or bin. Let's add some labels because well, I forgot to do that. Let's add a title. plt called the title function. We'll say exam scores. Let's make sure that that works. Yes, it does. Let's set a label for the x-axis. plt call the x label function. We'll say score. Here we go. Score. And for the y-axis, plt call the y label function. Number of students. Number of students is on the y- axis. All right, everybody. So, that's a histogram. It's a visual representation of the distribution of quantitative data. We're displaying the distribution of data. And well, everybody, those are histograms in Mattplot Lib. Yo. Hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to show you how we can create subplots using Mattplot Lib. There's a couple definitions we'll need to cover. One of which is a figure. A figure is the entire canvas in which we add a plot to. Then we have an ax. An ax is also known as a subplot. It's a single plot within a figure. A figure can contain multiple axes or subplots. We're going to call a subplots function. It's going to return a tpple that has a few things inside of it. Just to demonstrate temporarily, I'm going to print access plt call the subplots function. Within the subplots function, we're going to determine the layout of our figure. How many rows and columns of subplots will be within our figure? For example, we could have a 2x two, two rows, two columns. Or 2x3, two rows, three columns, or a 3x two, three rows, two columns. Let's stick with the 2x two for now. I want to show you what this function returns exactly. It's a little complex, but we'll break it down. The subplots function, it will return a tpple. The tpple has two entities, a figure object, which is our canvas, and a two-dimensional array of axes objects. When we call this function, we're going to unpack this tupler right away. Rather than use print, we're going to assign what's returned to us and unpack it. We'll create a figure object and an axis object. figure and axes equals call the subplots function. Figure is our canvas. We won't actually be using it in this topic, but we're provided with it by the subplots function. We'll print this two-dimensional list right away. Here's how we'll plot each of these subplots, but we won't add any data quite yet. Not until later. If I was to call the show function, we can see all the subplots that we have. access plt. Call the show function. We have four subplots, two rows, two columns. If this were a 1x two, one row, two columns, we have two subplots. Or a 2x 1, which would be two rows, one column. A 3x3 would be three rows, three columns. We don't need that many subplots, but I think you get the idea. We'll have a 2x two. Two rows, two columns. We'll fill each of these individual subplots in. Here's how. We'll start with the top left corner. Row 0, column 0. We'll access our 2D list of axes at row 0, column 0, and then plot it calling the plot function. We will need some data. We'll keep it simple. We'll say x equals a numpy array with a list that contains 1 2 3 4 5. We'll plot x. But to keep it simple, we'll just say y will be x * 2. Let's take a look. We've selected the subplot at row 0, column 0. So only this one is filled in with our data. Let's customize it. Let's set the color to be red with a keyword argument. The color is now red. And let's add a title. We need to select that specific subplot using a set of indices axes at row 0, column 0. Call the set title function. Then pass it a title. We'll say x 2 for the title. And there's the title for this specific subplot. Now we'll plot the top right subplot. We need to select that specific one. That would be row 0, column 1. We'll call the plot function. Pass in x. We'll say x to the^ of two for the y-axis. Select a color. I'll select blue. Then set the title axis at row 0 column 1. We will set the title to be x to the^ of two. The top right subplot should now be plotted. All right. Let's select the bottom left corner that will have different indices. axes at row one, column zero. We'll call the plot function. Pass in x. For y, we'll say x to the power of three. We'll set the color to be green. Then set a title axis at indices of 1, 0. Call the set title function. This will be x to the^ of three. Oops, looks like I misspelled color. There we go. Some of these subplots are overlapping. You can add a tight layout so everything fits. Access plt. Call the tight layout function. And now they should all fit in place, which they do. Let's finish this bottom right corner. I'll just copy and paste the last two lines. That would be axes at row one, column 1. This will be x ^ 4. The color will be purple. Axes at row 1, column 1. We'll set the title to be x to the^ of 4. There we go. We have now filled in the bottom right corner. Now, if this were a 3x3, well, then only these four subplots are still filled in, but we really don't need that many. Now, you don't necessarily need to use plots. You could use different graphs instead such as a bar chart or whatever else you would like. All right, everybody. And that is how to create subplots using mattplot lib. Yo. Hey everybody. In this video, we're going to integrate both pandas and mattplot lib. In my panda series, we've been working with the CSV file that contains the stats for the original 150 Pokémon. We'll be reusing that in this series. Or if there's another set of data that you would like to work with, feel free to use that, too. I'll post this in the comment section on YouTube and you can just copy and paste it if you would like. Just be sure to put it in a CSV file. To work with pandas, we'll need to import it. Import pandas. We'll give it a nickname as pd for short. When we read a CSV file, we're going to assign it to be a dataf frame, which we will name df. df equals access pandas as pd. call the read CSV function and then pass in the name of that file or a file path. The name of my file is data.csv. And it's right next to my main Python file. I don't need a file path beforehand. Let's be sure that it works. I'm going to print my data frame. Here are all the stats of the original 150 Pokémon. It's a truncated view though, but that's good enough. We'll create a bar chart that shows the quantity of the primary types. For example, there's grass types, there's fire types, dragon types, so on and so forth. We'll be selecting only a single column, a single series, type one. There is a secondary type of type two, but we won't be concerned with that in this video. To select a single column, we'll be using the subscript operator, which is a set of straight brackets. Then select the column. We will select type one. That is the primary type. We'll be returned with a single series, a single column. There is a built-in function of series. It's called value counts. And this is a function. This function will return the number in each category. So, if I were to run this, we would have a total of 28 water types, 22 normal types, 14 poison types, 12 fire types, and a whole bunch more. We'll plot the quantity of each type. The index we'll put on the y-axis with a horizontal bar chart, and the values we'll place on the x-axis. Now for convenience I'm going to assign our value counts. We'll say type count equals this series. Type count will be a series. It will hold the amount of each type. Now to create a bar chart, we'll access plt. Call the bar function. We'll create a horizontal bar chart in just a moment. For the x-axis, we'll access our series of type count, but I would like just the index. We don't need the entire series. And for the y-axis, we'll need the values. Take our series of type count. Access the values. Let's see what we have currently. We'll do a test run. Be sure to show your plot because I forgot to do that. There we go. Here's our bar chart. But we have a little bit of work to do. All of these index names are grouped together. Let's place them on the x-axis with a horizontal bar chart. We'll use a horizontal bar chart with bar h. That's a lot better. Now they're in ascending order. I would like the values with the most on the top rather than the bottom. Well, when we create our type count series, we can pass in a keyword argument. Ascending equals true. And they should now be in reverse order. You can change the colors if you would like. Pass in a keyword argument of color. Then pick a color. I'll use a hex color picker. I'll pick something blue. That's pretty decent. I'll copy the hex value and then paste it within that color keyword argument. Not bad. I'll also add an edge color of black. Edge color equals black. Let's add a title and some labels. PLT call the title function. This title will be number of Pokemon by primary type. Let's make sure that it works. Yes, it does. For the x-axis, we'll say count. plt. Call the x label function. Pass in the word of count. There we are. Then for the y-axis axis plt call the y label function. Pass in a word of type. Just to make sure everything fits. We're going to call the tight layout function so that everything fits. plt call the tight layout function. And now everything should fit within our figure. All right everybody. So that served as a final project for us. That's how to use both pandas and mapplot lib together."
OUnnuKHbmbU,DataFrames in Pandas are easy! 🔢,2025-09-04T14:00:37Z,"All right, let's do this everybody. We got to talk about data frames. In pandas, a dataf frame is a tabular data structure with rows and columns. It's two-dimensional similar to an Excel spreadsheet. Here's a beginner friendly way in which we can create a data frame. Let's start with a dictionary. We'll say data equals a dictionary. For our data, we'll have some employees. For the key of name, this will be a column. Instead of just having a single value, we'll use a list, a Python list. Here, we can list a few different names. I'm going to use Spongebob characters because most people know who Spongebob is. We'll have Spongebob, Patrick, and Squidward. Then we'll add another column. This column will be for the age. How old is each employee? The value will be another Python list. I'm going to say that Spongebob is around 30. Patrick will be 35. Squidward will be 50. Let me just do a little bit of organizing there. That looks pretty good. Now, we're going to convert our dictionary into a dataf frame. Here's how. We will assign dataf frame, but most people shorten this to just df meaning dataf frame. our dataf frame object equals access pandas spd call the dataf frame constructor. Now the d is capital not lowercase that's because this is a constructor rather than a function. We're going to pass in our data, our dictionary. And then we will print our data frame which we have named DF for short. And here's our data frame. It's tabular data. It's made of rows and columns. We're also given an index. This index has a label for each row starting with zero. But you can set that to be something custom. To do so, when we construct a dataf frame object, we will set an index by passing in a keyword argument. index equals a Python list. We'll say employee 1, then employee 2, then employee 3, and we should have some new labels. There we go. Employee 1 is Spongebob, age30. Employee 2 is Patrick, age 35. Employee 3 is Squidward, age 50. If you need to select a single row, you can access the lock property. DF.Lock subscript operator. Lock means location by label. Give me all the data for employee one. That's the label. We are given Spongebob age 30. Here's the label and the data type of this row. It's an object. Let's select employee 2, Patrick, age 35. The label is employee 2. The data type for this row is an object. And employee 3, we have Squidward, age 50. Employee 3 data type is an object. Now you can also select by integer location by using the eyelock property. I lock. So the index zero will give you the first row which is again Spongebob. One is for Patrick. Two is for Squidward. Let's just print the entire data frame. Now if you need to add a new column, here's how. I'll just add a comment. Add a new column. And I'm just going to zoom out a little bit. To create a new column, we'll access our data frame. Use the subscript operator. Then we'll need to think of a new column name. Let's say job or position. What does everybody do? We will assign this to be a Python list. The number of values must match the number of rows. We have three rows, one for Spongebob, Patrick, and Squidward. In that order, what is the job of Spongebob? He is a cook. That's the first value. Let's say Patrick is a new employee. He doesn't have a position quite yet. For the time being, we'll say NA for not available. And then Squidward is a cashier. Now, let's print our data frame. And we should have a new column. Employee one is a cook. Employee two, their job is not available yet. And employee three, employee 3 is a cashier. That's how to make a new column. Now, how do we add a new row? Here's how. Add a new row. An easy way to create a new row is to create a new data frame, then concatenate it. We'll say new row equals access pandas spd call the dataf frame constructor again. Now we're going to pass in a list. For this list, you can add a dictionary for each new row you want to add. For example, if I need to add three rows, I'll need three dictionaries within this list. But for now, we'll just add one. This dictionary needs key value pairs. For the key of name, we'll add, let's say, Sandy. For the key of age, we'll add a value of 28. Then for the key of job, we'll add a value of I would say that SI is some sort of scientist or engineer, but we'll just say engineer. This is a separate data frame. It only contains a single row. a new record for Sandy. We're going to concatenate it to our existing dataf frame. We will reassign our data frame df equals access pandas spd. Call the concat function for concatenate. You may see people use append, but that's now depreciated. We'll be using concat for concatenation. We will pass in a python list. Then include all of the data frames we want to concatenate. We want to include our existing data frame and the new row. And then let's print our data frame. And we should have a new row. Yes, we have a new row for Sandy. However, we have not set an index. The index was set to zero. Well, we can manually update that. When we create a new data frame, you can pass in an index as a keyboard argument. We'll do that for Sandy. So, comma, space, and just for readability, I'll put this on a new line. index equals a Python list with a new label for her of employee 4. And here we go. Employee 4 is Sandy, age 28. Her job is an engineer. Now, you can add more than one row. Let's add new rows. This variable will be new rows. So within our list, we can add more than one dictionary. Let's add another row. I'll do some copying and pasting just to save a little bit of time. Copy all the key value pairs and paste it within the new dictionary. Let's say the new employee is Mr. Krabs. His first name is Eugene. Eugene Krabs. He seems like he's about 60. His job is that he is a manager. We'll assign him to be employee five. And then we are adding new rows to our data frame. All right, let's take a look. There they are. We have two new rows. One for Sandy and another for Eugene. Sandy is 28. She's an engineer. Eugene is 60. He's a manager. All right everybody, those are data frames. Dataf frames are a tabular data structure. They contain rows and columns. Your homework is in the comment section. To post the output of a dataf frame, try and think of a unique example if you can. And well everybody, those are dataf frames using pandas."
6WaBryk4fkE,Slicing in NumPy is easy! ✂️,2025-07-27T15:25:48Z,"Yo, hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to show you slicing using numpy. Let's get into it. We'll need an array to work with. For this demonstration, we'll create a 2D array. Array equals np. Call the array function. Then we'll pass in a 2D list. There will be four rows and four columns. So, within this list, we will have four nested lists. We'll have the numbers 1 through 16. That should be enough for this demonstration. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 13 14 15 16. Just for readability, I'll put each row on a new line. There we go. We have a matrix of data, a 2D array. For array slicing, we'll be using the subscript operator. I'll add this as a comment. We will access our array. Use the subscript operator which is a set of straight brackets. Here we will write a slice expression. There's three options. You can list a starting index, an ending index, and a step. Each is separated with a colon, a slice operator. Let's give it a try. Let's say I would like the first row, the first row in my 2D array. Here's how I would print that. Within a print statement, I'm going to access our array. Use the subscript operator, which is a set of straight brackets. Then we will list where we would like to start. Let's access array at index zero. That's going to return the first row 1 2 3 4. Array at index 1 would be 5 6 7 8. Remember that with programming, we tend to start collections with an index of zero. So that's why the second row has an index of 1. The second index would be row 3. 9 10 11 12. Index 3 is 13 14 15 16. Then if we access for it's out of bounds. You can also use negative indexing. Array at index of -1 would give you the last row 13 14 15 16 or -2 would be the second to last row 9 10 11 12 that is the starting index at which element would you like to start you can also select a range we need both a start and an ending index let's select the first three we'll start at index zero colon that's the slice operator ator and end at three. Now the ending index it's exclusive. So if we need the first three that would be 0 1 2 3 that will give you indices 0 through two because the ending index is exclusive. We have row 0 1 2. Or perhaps I would like the first three rows after index zero or row zero so to say. Well, we'll start at one, then continue to four. We'll skip index zero and print the next three rows. If you would like to select everything up until the end, you can omit the second number, but you still need that colon. This tells Python select everything up until the end. Now, we'll introduce a step. Let's select every second row starting with the first row 0 and row two 0 colon 4. This will select rows 0 through three. Remember the ending index is exclusive. Give me every second row. We'll add a colon and then the step. We're counting by twos. This will give me row zero and row two. 1 2 3 4 9 10 11 12. If we're selecting all rows, you can omit the start and the end, but you still need those two colons. And the reason that you need them is because if we omit these, omit the colons, numpy thinks we're selecting the second index. So with those two colons, if we omit the start and the end, we're telling NumPy, select all rows. You can also set the step to be negative. This will return all the rows reversed. So we have the bottommost row 13 14 15 16 at the top and the rows are in reverse order. I'm actually curious what if you set this to -2. Oh, that's interesting. I didn't know that. Now the rows are in reverse order and we're selecting every second row. I actually didn't know that. I was just curious. I was wondering what would happen if I put -2 here. All right. So that is row selection. Now we'll get into column selection. Now we're going to get into column selection. We can select specific columns. This first column has an index of zero because with programming collections tend to have an index of zero to begin with. This next column would have an index of one. The third column has an index of two. And the fourth column has an index of three. When accessing our 2D array, we'll need two indices. for example 0 comma 0. The first index is for the row. The second index is for the column. Now if you would like to select all rows for the row selection, we're just going to add a colon because without it, we're going to have a syntax error. Invalid syntax. For the row selection, we do need something here. We're selecting all rows, then access column zero. That would give me 1 5 913. 1 5 913. Column 1 would be 26 1014. Column 2 is 3 7115. Column 3 is 48 1216. If I set the index to be -1, that's going to return the last column 481 1216. or the second to last column would be -2 3 7 1115 3 7 111 15 Now we'll select a range I would like the first three columns this would be column 0 column 1 column 2 we need a start and ending index we'll start at column zero so this number is going to be three because of the ending index index is exclusive. This will print the first three columns. We have 1 5 93 2 6 10 14 3 7 11 15. That is the first three columns. Now we'll skip the first column but print all the columns that come after. We'll start at column one or index of one so to say. continue to four. So we skip the first column. This one we're skipping it and print all the columns that come after. If you would like all columns until the end of your data, you can omit the step, but you still need that colon. That works as well. Now we'll select every second column by setting the step. We'll be given column zero and column two. We have 1 5 913 and 3 7 11 15. Now I would like every second column, but we'll start at column 1. That would be 2. This gives us 2 6 10 14 and 4 8 12 16. Then you can reverse the order of the columns. Set the step to be -1. We have 4 8 12 16 3 7 11 15 2 6 10 14 and 1 5 91 13. If our step was -2, this would be in reverse order, but we're given every second column. 4 8 12 16 210 14. Now, we're going to combine both row and column selection. We'll need two indices. Let's say that we would like the first two rows, but only the first two columns. We'll start with our row selection. We're starting at row 0 and end at row two. 0 col 2. Then for the column, we need the first two. 0 1 stop at two. 0 col 2. That's going to give me the first two columns of the first two rows. It's kind of like we're selecting a quadrant. This is a 4x4 matrix and I would like to select these four numbers. Now we'll select this quadrant. 3 4 7 8. Take a guess as to what you would have to write. We're selecting the first two rows. We can keep the selection the same for the rows, but for the columns, we're starting at let's see 0 1 2 2 colon 4. But since we're selecting all columns till the end, we can omit the second number. But we still need the colon. So we get 3 4 7 8. Now we'll select the last two rows, but the first two columns. What row are we going to start with? 0 1 2 continue to four. But since we're continuing to the end, we can omit the ending index. Now I would like the first two columns. That would be 0 col 2. That's going to give you this quadrant 9 10 134. Now we need the last two rows and the last two columns. We'll keep our row selection the same. Start at column, let's see, 012. Continue to four. But since we're continuing to the end, we can omit the second number. And we should get 11 12 15 16. This quadrant. All right, everybody. That is slicing in numpy. I can't think of any homework for you to do. So, to increase engagement for this video, why don't you post your favorite movie in the comment section down below? And well everybody that is slicing using numpy."
mjiHc965UME,Convert decimal to hexadecimal EASY!  #coding #programming #computerscience,2025-07-20T14:51:42Z,"Yo, hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to show you how we can convert a decimal number to hexadimal. Here's how. Let's say we have the decimal number of 896. Hexadimal is base 16. Hexa decimal. With our decimal number, all we got to do is repeatedly divide this number by 16. We'll take 8,96, divide this by 16. That gives us a quotient of 506. This does divide evenly. There is no remainder. Our remainder is zero. For the next step, we take the quotient. In this case, 56. 56 / 16. Again, the quotient is 31. 56 doesn't divide by 16 evenly. We have a remainder of 10. Take the quotient 31 / 16. Again, we have a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 15. Then we have one for our quotient. 1 / 16 equals 0. Since our quotient is 0, that's where we're going to stop. And we have a remainder of 1. We have to take all the remainders to get our hexadesimal number. The bottommost number is the most significant bit and the top is the least significant bit. With our remainder values, they can only be single digits. Here we have a 10 and a 15. According to this chart, we have 0= 0 all the way till 9= 9. We have single letters to represent numbers. A corresponds to 10. B corresponds to 11 all the way till F which corresponds to 15. 15 is actually F 10 is A. 8,96 converted to hexadimal is 1 F A 0. And that's how to convert decimal to hexadimal."
sHrlK5tOGpw,Learn hexadecimal in 0x79 seconds #coding #computerscience #programming,2025-07-16T14:10:13Z,"In this video, I'm going to show you how to easily convert hexadeimal numbers to decimal. Normally with decimal digits, they range in values between 0 through 9. But with hexadimal, we have some letters, too. We have the letters A through F. Here's a key. Starting with 0, 0= 0, 1= 1, all the way till 9. 9= 9. But we also have letters to represent single digits. A= 10, B= 11, C= 12, all the way to F which equals 15. Each of these letters has a corresponding value. Hexadimal is base 16. To convert this hexadimal value to decimal, we'll follow this pattern. Starting from the right and working our way towards the left, we will multiply each digit by powers of 16. With the first digit, we'll multiply 9 * 16 to the power of 0. Then we'll multiply a. Remember according to that key a= 10 multiply 10 * 16 ^ of 1 f had a corresponding value of 15 15 * 16 to the^ of 2 and then 2 * 16 to the^ of 3 16 ^ of 0 is just 1 9 * 1 gives us 9. According to that key, a equ= 10. 10 * 16 is 160. F has a value of 15. 15 * 16^ 2ar that is 3,840. And then 2 * 16 to the^ of 3 that is 8,192. Then we just have to add these numbers together. 8,192 + 3,840 + 160 + 9. That will give us a decimal value of 12,201 in decimal. And that's how to easily convert hexadimal values to decimal."
tg5Wv9Ba1lI,Learn binary in 01000000 seconds #coding #computerscience #programming,2025-07-13T15:43:58Z,"Here's how to read binary numbers in roughly 60 seconds. Binary numbers are either a 0ero or a 1. Decimal numbers are 0 through 9. With a binary number, the digit most to the right is the least significant bit. The digit most to the left is the most significant bit. When converting a binary number to decimal, I like to think of it like a point system. Starting with the least significant bit and working our way towards the left. The first digit is worth one point. The next digit is worth double the amount of points as the previous two. Two doubled is four. Four doubled is eight. And we would just continue with this pattern. Reading our binary number. If one of these digits contains a one, we get some number of points. Then we would add all of our points together. 128 + 32 + 8 + 2 + 1 gives us a decimal number of 171. And that's how to read binary in roughly 60 seconds."
