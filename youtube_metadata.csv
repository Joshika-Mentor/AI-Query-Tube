fPopFeqw5sk,Learn NumPy data types in 8 minutes! 💱,2025-11-21T15:40:45Z,"Yo, hello again everybody. In this video, I'm going to explain what the dtype is in numpy. DT type, it's a keyword argument. It tells NumPy the kind of values that you're going to store in an array. If you don't set the dype, numpy guesses the best data type based on your data. By manually setting the dype, it improves performance and is more memory efficient, especially when working with larger data sets. Here are a few of the more beginnerfriendly data types for NumPy. We have integers int 8 through int 64. The number after int represents the number of bits allocated to store that number. The higher the number, the more memory that's used. We have floats, float 16 through float 64, booleans, strings, and objects. You'll want to be cautious with objects. More on that later. Let's go over a few examples. After importing numpy as np, we will create an array. array equals a numpy array with just a few digits. How about the numbers one through five? Now I will print my array. You can get the d type that's a property. Access my array then access the d type. The dtype of my array is int 64. If you don't specify a d type explicitly, numpy is going to guess what the best data type will be. We're using 64 bits to hold each number. Then to display the number of bytes that your array uses, I'm going to use an F string. I'll add a placeholder, but I will take my array access n bytes for the number of bytes. And I will display the word bytes. My array it uses 40 bytes. The d type is int 64. 8 bits is one bite. Eight bytes times five elements, that's 40. If I were to add another six, I bet the number of bytes is going to be 48, which it is. To manually set the dype to something else, we'll pass in a keyword argument. When we create an array, we will set the dype equal to access numpy. Then choose a new data type. Instead of using in 64, we'll use int32, which uses up 32 bits instead of 64 bits. So now the d type is int32 and my array is using 20 bytes rather than 40. Since we only have five elements, it's not going to make too much of a difference. But imagine if you had like 1 million elements, reducing the amount of memory by half is greater then. Or we could use int 16 for 16 bits. Now our array is 10 bytes or even int 8. Now our array takes up five bytes. Be careful though cuz you can only store a number so big. Depending on the number of bits that you're using, there is a maximum size. Int 8 is very small. We can only store a number up to 127. Just to demonstrate, we'll change some of these numbers around. 126 127 128. We have an overflow error. Python integer 128 is out of bounds for int 8. Anything 128 or above is too big because that uses more than 8 bits, but in 16 would work. Let's change that to int 16. That appears to be enough space. Here's a little chart on the screen to display the minimum and maximum values that each of these integer data types can hold. The higher the bit number, the more memory you're going to use. Let's change these numbers back to 1 through 5. Let's explore floatingoint numbers. I'll set the dtype to be float 64. Here are my floatingoint numbers. Each of them has a decimal point afterwards. The type is float 64. We're using 64 bits for each number. And my total array is using up 40 bytes. Here's float 32. We're using 20 bytes. We still have a bunch of floatingoint numbers and float 16. And we're using 10 bytes. Now, for booleans, the data type is going to be bool, then an underscore. If you don't include that underscore, that's a Python boolean. But bool with an underscore afterwards, that's a numpy boolean. So my numbers converted to boolean would give me all true values. So anything that's non zero when converted to a boolean, it's going to be true. If I were to add a zero, that's going to be false. Any nonzero number converted to a boolean is true. Then we have strings, which is str My numbers are now converted to strings. In the DT type, it's actually little Indian u for unic code and then one. This data type, it's for a fixed length unicode string. The length of these numbers is one character. If these were two characters, I'll just add some zeros to the end of each number. Well, then the number of characters is two. Let's change that back. Basically, numpy will promote this generic string type into a fixed size unicode string. Rather than numbers, I'll put some strings within here. Apple, orange, banana. For the data type of my fixed length unicode string, the number of characters allowed is six. It's based on which element uses the most amount of characters, which would be banana. Well, I guess orange has six characters, too, but Apple only has five. You could explicitly set the dype to a fixed length unicode string to limit the amount of characters. As a string, you would type less than u. Then let's say four characters. Here's what's within my array. Now, any characters beyond four get truncated. We have apple, orin banana. That's how you can limit the number of characters in a string within a numpy array. And then we have objects. That would be object underscore. So be cautious when working with objects. Operations fall back to Python, not NumPy's optimize C code. We lose those speed advantages when working with Python objects. So this does allow you to mix and match data types. Like I'll put true within here. I'll put a string and then a floatingoint number. You can mix and match data types, but you do lose your numpy speed boost. Creating a numpy array of objects could be necessary when working with custom classes, datetime objects, or you're planning on converting it to pandas later. Now, if you want to convert from one data type to another after already creating your array, you can call the as type function. Currently, I have an array of integers. I'll convert them to be floatingoint numbers. We're going to reassign our array. Take our array, then call the as type function, then pass in a new data type. I'll convert my integers to be float 16. And here's what we have now. We have floatingoint numbers. The data type is float 16 and we're using 10 bytes. Or if these are originally floatingoint numbers, let's say 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5. I'm going to delete that temporarily. We have some floatingoint numbers. Float 64. Let's convert them to be integers. array as type pass in a new type int 16. So that decimal portion gets truncated. The data type is in 16 and we're using up 10 bytes. All right everybody, that is dtype and numpy. Passing in a keyword argument of dtype tells numpy what's going to be stored within this array. What's their data type? And using the as type function, you can always convert it to another data type later. And well everybody, that is the dtype keyword argument in numpy."
xf71dRBRP6o,Build a music player with Python! 🎶,2025-11-20T16:51:00Z,"What is going on everybody? In this video, I thought it'd be pretty fun to walk you through how to create an MP3 player using Python, assuming you have some MP3 files to work with. I have a folder called music. And within it, I have a few MP3 files. If you do need some MP3 files to work with, you can always go to YouTube's audio library and download some for non-commercial use. But here are a few songs that I picked. Now, what I'm going to do is take my music folder. You can name it something else if you want to. And I will drag and drop it into my project folder. The same one that contains my main Python file. Let's start off with some imports. We will import the OS module. The OS module interacts with the operating system. We're also going to use Pygame. Import Pygame. If Pygame is underlined red, you can hover over it, then click install package. Pygame. Pygame [clears throat] has a built-in audio mixer and it's really convenient to use. Now, another option is within your terminal to install Pygame. You would type pip install Pygame. But it looks like it has already worked. Now, when creating a program, I like to add the following line of code. If dunder name is equal to a string of dunder main. If so, we will call a main function, which we still need to declare. This line of code checks to see if we're running our main Python file directly or if it's being imported as a module in another script. We're going to be running this file directly. We need to define a function of main. Define main. This is where we'll have our main body of code within the main function. What we'll do within the main function first when we start our program we're going to initialize pygame audio mixer we will access pygame access its mixer then call the init function to initialize it. Basically mixer is a pygame module for loading and playing sounds. Now if you would like you can surround this with a try block. Try and initialize the audio mixer. If we encounter an exception except pygame error, we'll give it an alias as e. We'll print something like audio initialization failed. And we can print the error message too which we've named as e. Then we will return to exit the main function. Now, if we were to run this within our output, we have a Pygame support prompt. This is kind of annoying. You can actually suppress it. Here's how. After importing the operating system, but before importing Pygame, we can access the OS module. Then access environment, which is shortened to E N VI O N subscript operator pi game_hide support_prompt. We will set this to a string of hide. And that should hide that support prompt, which it does. Yeah, it's kind of annoying that you have to do this. I wish we didn't have that support prompt. Anyways, our audio mixer is initialized. What can we do now? I'm going to create a variable, a folder. It's going to contain a name, the name of our folder. Mine is music, but yours might be something different depending on what you named it. Folder equals a string of music. If we're working with file paths, I can use this folder as a variable. Now, we'll check to see if this folder doesn't exist. If so, we'll print a message. You can write the following. Let me scroll down a little bit. If not, access OS access path then call the is dur function. Path is a module within the OS library. is dur returns true if the file path we pass in exists. So if we were to take our variable folder and pass that in. If this folder exists, then we'll return true. But we're using if not if this folder doesn't exist, what do you want to do? We'll print a message. We'll print I'll use an fring folder. Then insert the folder variable not found. I'll put this within single quotes too. And then return to exit the main function up here. I do have a folder called music. Currently if I run this program, nothing happens, which is good. But let's say that the folder doesn't exist or I misspel the string. music with an extra C. Well, the folder of music with two C's wasn't found. So, that's how you can use the is there function to check to see if a folder or directory exists. Now, within this folder, we have to get all the MP3 files. Here's how. This will be a list, a list of MP3 files. We'll name the list mp3 files equals a list comprehension. So with the list comprehension, I like to start with the for loop portion first. For every file in then we'll access the library of os call the list dur function. Then pass in our folder. list all the files within our folder. But we'll add an if statement. If the file then call the function of ends with ends with the file extension of MP3. If so, return that file. So basically we're saying for every file in this folder of music, if it's an MP3 file, which they are, return that file. So just to test it, I'm going to print I will print my MP3 files. And here they are. I have five MP3 files. If there are no MP3 files, we can print a message. We'll say if not MP3 files. If this list is empty, then let's print no MP3 files found. Just temporarily, I'm going to move these MP3 files to my project folder. I want this folder to be empty for testing purposes. All right, let's run this. No MP3 files found. If our folder doesn't contain any MP3 files, we get this message. Let's put those files back. Moving on to part two. We have a list of MP3 files. I will create a while loop. While true. This will contain the main loop of our program. If we ever want to exit, we can break to break out of the loop. Within my loop, I will print. I'll add some text decoration. Just a few asterisks. MP3 player, a few asterisks again. And then print my song list. Here we're going to output all of our songs and we'll use the enumerate function for every index, song in enumerate. So what the enumerate function does, enumerate returns an enumerate object. It's an iterator. And when you get the next element in this sequence, it'll return a tpple. It'll return a number to enumerate something and the next item in the sequence. So we're going to enumerate our MP3 files as well as a number which will serve as the index. Normally it starts at zero but we'll set that to start at one. So pass in a keyword argument of start equals 1. Now within this loop we'll use a print statement. We will print we'll use an fstring print the index a period then insert the song the song name. So now when we run this then just temporarily I'm going to break because currently we're stuck in an infinite loop with no way to escape. We'll put that in for testing purposes. So when we run this we should get a list of our songs. I have five songs. Each of these songs is enumerated because we've used the enumerate function. We have an index and a song name. Now, if we didn't use the enumerate function, it would look something like this. For every song in MP3 files, output each song. So, you could write it that way, but I like including those numbers, the index number. We'll need them later anyways. Okay, let's no longer break. We're going to accept some user input. We'll say choice input equals call the input function. New line enter the song number to play. Or if the user wants to quit, we'll say or capital Q to quit colon space. Looks like I misspelled input. If the user wants to exit, we have to check to see if this variable is a capital Q. We can use an if statement. If choice input dot call the upper function just in case they type in a lowercase Q we'll make it uppercase is equal to a character of capital Q. That means the user wants to quit. If so let's print a goodbye message by and break to break out of the infinite loop. Okay let's test it. MP3 player my song list. Enter the song number to play or Q to quit. You know what? I just want to quit. I will press Q. I can do lowercase Q or capital Q. And we print by and we exit the program. Good. We can at least escape that loop. Let's say the user doesn't type in a song number or the letter Q. Let's check to see if the choice input is not a digit. If not choice input, we can check to see if this is a digit. Call the is digit method where we will print enter a valid number. Then we can use continue. Break will break out of the loop. Continue will skip one cycle. If the user's choice is not a digit, do this. We'll test it. Enter song number to play or Q to quit. Um, I'm going to type in P for pizza. Enter a valid number. And then we have that prompt again. We have to enter something valid here. We'll choose a song number. This will be a variable of choice. Choice equals. Now our choice input it's a string because when you accept user input it's a string. We'll convert it to be an integer using explicit type casting. So take your choice input and type cast it to an integer. Now take a look at this. Let's say I want the first song number one that has an index of zero and the next song would have an index of one. So on and so forth. We're going to subtract one from our choice input. The song number doesn't match with the index number. By subtracting one, it will. We have to see if the numbered choice falls within that range of songs that we have. within an if statement. If zero is less than or equal to our choice and is it less than call the length function the length of our list of MP3 files. I have five files within this list. So if my choice falls between zero and four, then we'll play a song. But if it's outside that range, we won't. For now, I'm going to pass else. We're trying to play something outside of that range. We'll print invalid choice. Let's test it. We have song numbers 1 through 5. I'll play song number 42069. Invalid choice. And we get our prompt again. Okay, let's type in something serious. I'll type in one. Okay, nothing appears to happen. That's good. Here's where we'll play some music. So rather than pass, we're going to call a function, but we still need to define that function. We're going to call a function of play music. We'll pass in our folder as well as pass in our list of MP3 files. subscript operator the numbered choice. So if choice is zero, we're passing in the first item within our list. Or if choice was one, that would be the next item. So now we have to define this function of play music. So scrolling back to the top before our main function, we can actually collapse this. We're going to define a function of play music. We're passing in two arguments, folder and a song name. The parameters will be folder, song name. We'll combine them both folder and song name. We'll name it file path equals access the library of OS access the module of path. Then call the join function. We're going to join our folder and our song name. Basically we're concatenating our folder name and our song name. It'll be a lot easier for us to work with these songs if we need to access them. For some reason, if this file path doesn't exist, if not access the library of OS access path, then call the exists function. If this file path doesn't exist because we're using not. If this file path doesn't exist, we'll print file not found. then return to return to our main function. Just temporarily for testing purposes, let's take out not and say file found. I would like the first song. I'll type in one, hit enter. File found. Okay, that's good. So, we're checking if that file doesn't exist. So, undo those changes. At this point, we have a valid file path. We're going to use Pygame audio mixer to load that file. We'll access Pygame, then access our mixer, access music, then call the load function, then pass in that file path. Then we're going to play that file after loading it. piameixer dot music. Then call the play function to play it. We will print I'll use an fstring. I'll add a new line. Now playing colon space. We will insert our song name. We don't want to display the full file path when showing the song that we're playing. We're going to use the song name, not file path. And then we'll add a few commands. Print commands. A user is going to be able to pause, capital P for pause, comma, space. We'll do capital R for resume. Resume after pausing that is and S S for stop. Okay, let's see if we can play a song. Uh I will play song number how about four. All right, it's working. And then we'll stop it by pressing this red square because we have no way to actually stop it yet. All right, we'll create a loop. While true, we could do the following commands and just break if we want to exit. We will assign a variable of command equals accept user input. Now for the prompt. For the prompt I'm going to use a greater than sign space. Then with our input we will call the upper function to make it uppercase in case the user types in one of these letters lowercase. We'll just convert it to be uppercase to make it easy. So a user can pause resume and stop. We can use a few if statements for that. So within our while loop if command is equal to a capital P then pygame domixer domusic call the pause function to pause the song and we'll print paused. else if our command is equal to R they want to resume and I'll just copy this line of code we're going to unpause then print resumed else if our command is s they want to Stop pygame.mmixer domusic call the stop function. Then we will print stopped and return. We need return so we can break out of this while loop. Anything else is an invalid command. else print invalid command. And that should be everything. Let's test it. Okay. MP3 player. My song list. Enter the number song to play. I'll start with one. I'm going to pause. I'll press P. The song is paused. I'll resume again by entering R. Now I'm going to stop by pressing S. Okay. And we're back to the main menu. I'll pick a different song. I'll pick number two. Oh yeah, that's my jam. All right. Now I'm going to pause, then resume, and then stop. Let's try number five. Pause. Resume. Pause. Resume. Stop. And Q to quit. Bye. All right, everybody. That is how you can create an MP3 player using Python."
k0D3MQwLn7A,Learn Python iterators in 7 minutes! ➡️,2025-11-10T14:21:48Z,"Hey, what is going on everybody? In this video, I'm going to explain Python iterators in just a few minutes. An iterator is an object that returns elements one at a time from a sequence or other data stream. It remembers its position between calls. A Python object, it's considered an iterator if it follows the iterator protocol, meaning it has these two methods, dunder itter and dunder next. All dunder itter does is that it returns itself and dunder next it's going to be in charge of returning the next item in the sequence and it raises a stop iteration exception when there's no more items to return. So in this demonstration we're going to create a class of dice class dice. We need a constructor define dunder init. We'll have one parameter besides self rolls. How many dice would we like to roll? We'll need to assign our rolls self.rolls equals the amount of rolls we receive. We will also have an internal attribute of count to keep track of how many dice we have already rolled, which we will set to zero initially. We need to implement these two methods in order for this class to create iterator objects. So dunder it, all it's going to do is return itself. We have no parameters besides self. All this method does is return self. Basically, when we use this class to create an object and assign it, we'll implicitly behind the scenes call this method. More on that in a moment. Then we need dunder next. This method is in charge of returning the next item in a sequence. There's many different ways in which we can implement this method. Let's do the following. Let's say if self.count, count. How many dice have we already rolled? Initially, it's zero. If the count is less than the number of rolls, the number of dice we have to roll self.rolls, we will roll some dice within an if statement. But first, we will increment count self.ount plus equals 1. And then return a random dice roll. Random. We'll need to import this module. import this name of random. So be sure to include import random at the top. Return random.rand int between 1 through six. This will return a random number between 1 through 6. When we call dunder next, we're returning a random number. Now if we want to stop, we need to raise a stop iteration exception. We'll handle that within an else statement. else we will raise a stop iteration exception and that's all we have to do our class of dice will create iterator objects those objects will have these two methods done it and dunder next let's test it I will create a dice object dice equals call the constructor for dice how many dice do we want to roll I'll pass in three to roll three dice our dice object. It's an iterator. It has these two methods and it's also iterable, meaning I can use it in a for loop. For every dice in dice, I will print each dice. Let's test it. I have three random dice rolls. 611, 653, 311. If you would like, you can also use a list comprehension. Here's how. Let's say we have dice. Dice equals a list comprehension. I like to start with the for loop. For every dice in called the dice constructor, I'll pass in three dice. Then we need an expression. I'll keep the expression the same as the loop variable of die. Return each die for every die in our dice. And then if I were to print my list of dice, I should have a list with random dice rolls. Here we have 533. Maybe I'll pass in one more. Four dice. 4 6 4 6. Now you're probably wondering how are these two methods called? We didn't call them explicitly at all. So here's what's actually going on. When we run this program, the Python interpreter, it's going to translate these higher level operations into lower level operations. Behind the scenes within the Python interpreter, this program is going to be translated into something like this. You don't have to write this down, but do pay attention. Our program is being translated into something similar to this. We're rolling three dice. Dice equals call the dice constructor. Let me move down a little bit. We have an iterator object equals. Then there's an iter function and then we're passing in our dice object. The iter function, what it does, it looks within this dice object and calls the dunder function. This is no different from this dice. Then there's going to be some sort of while loop while true. And then within a try block we will assign a role. Roll ro equals a next function pass in our iterator. The next function it looks within this object and calls the dunder next function. That would be the same as us writing iterator.dunder next. But we don't have to write it that way. And then we will print each role. We do need an accept block. except stop iteration then break to break out of our while loop. So this program is going to run the same. We have three random dice rolls. But we don't have to write it this way with our original Python program. It's translated into a program similar to this that uses lower level operations. Behind the scenes within our Python interpreter, we're calling dunder itter and dunder next. But again, we don't need to write it this way. We can write it the original way. Our higher level operations are being translated in the Python interpreter into lower level operations which are explicitly calling these methods. All right, everybody. Those are iterators in Python. They're Python objects that return elements in a sequence one at a time. For a Python object to be considered an iterator, you need these two methods. Dunder and dunder next. And well everybody, those are iterators in Python."
ZBlxaXMN_hU,Learn Python generator expressions in 9 minutes! ♻️,2025-11-07T15:08:16Z,"All right, everybody. In this video, I'm going to explain generator expressions in Python. A generator expression, it's similar to a list comprehension. We use a set of parenthesis rather than a set of straight brackets. A generator expression, it creates a generator. They're iterable. They yield values one at a time. And by using a generator expression, there's no need to define a function or use yield. However, they're less flexible than generator functions, and they can only be used once. they're not reusable. Basically, you follow this formula. It's very similar to a list comprehension. Within a set of parenthesis, you have some expression for every value in an iterable. In the last video, we've created a generator function that counts up to a certain number. It yields values one at a time rather than dumping all of the values at once like a normal function with return. Yield pauses the function, returns a value, then continues the function again. We're going to recreate a similar program but use a generator expression instead. Here's how. I'm going to delete this function. We'll accept some user input which I will name number. We're counting up to a certain number. We'll need some input. Input. Enter a number to count up. Then we will type cast this as an integer because normally user input is a string. All right. Now we'll write a generator expression. A generator expression, it returns an object. The object is iterable. So you can use it in a for loop. With our object name, let's name it counter. Counter equals a generator expression. You need a set of parenthesis. The formula is similar to a list comprehension expression for value in iterable. To best explain this, we'll start with the for loop portion. For every value for our loop variable, let's name it count. For every count in, then we need something iterable. We can use the range function. That's an option for the range of numbers between 1, our number, our user input. But we'll add plus one because this argument is exclusive, not inclusive. So if we need to count to 10, the range of numbers will be 1 comma 11 exclusive. Now we do need an expression. We can take our loop variable and do stuff with it before assigning it. We're not going to do anything with it. We'll just rewrite count for the expression. So al together count for count in then use the range function and this should work. So this is our generator expression. It's assigning an object. The object is iterable, so we can use it in a loop. For every number, um, but it looks like I already have a number variable. Let's rename this to something else. We'll just say n, n for short. For every n number in our counter, we will print each number of n. Let's test it. Enter a number to count up to. Let's count up to 10. There we go. 1 through 10. All right. Now, I'm going to count up to something ridiculous like a cajillion. And we're getting each value one at a time. But this is going to take forever. So, I'm going to terminate this program. But we know that it works with our generator expression. There's no need to define a function or use yield. However, a generator expression is less flexible with its logic because within a function, you can write some really complex stuff and these aren't reusable. They're not within a function. So, we can't call them repeatedly. Another great place to use a generator expression is when reading a file. Here's how we can do that. So, on my desktop in the previous video, we've created a test file that contains some sample text. I'm going to copy this file location. Right click, go to properties, copy this location. We'll need it. We will create a file path variable equal to within a string. Paste that file path. Include the file name and the extension. And we'll need to use double backslashes. There we go. All right. When opening and closing files, we'll want to use a width block. with call the open function. Then you can pass in that file path as file. The as keyword, it assigns a resource as a variable name, the file that we're opening. The width block will handle opening and closing any resources. Now, normally with a generator expression, it won't close any resources such as files automatically. That's why we're putting it within a width block. Now we need to write a generator expression. We'll say lines. Lines will be an object. The object that's returned to us via a generator expression. We need a set of parenthesis and then follow this formula. Expression for value in iterable. But I like to start with the for loop portion first. For every line in my iterable of file, my file is an iterable. Then we'll need an expression. What do we want to do with each line? I'm going to return each line. But we could write something more complex if we need to. For example, follow this with strip. This will strip any unnecessary white space. So that's our generator expression. We could use the object returned to us in the loop. for every line in my object of lines. We will print each line. And let's see if this works, which it does. Here are the contents of that text file. All right, here's a challenge round. Within your generator expression, you can add an if condition. If condition, we'll create a range of numbers and square all of them with a generator expression. We'll accept some user input. Number equals accept some user input. Enter a number to square up two. Then type cast this as an integer. We'll write a generator expression. It returns an object. This object will be squares. Then we'll write a generator expression for every value in iterable. We'll start with that portion. For every let's say for every x in my range of 1, our number + one. Then the expression we will take x then square it. x to the power of two and then we can print our squares. For every square in squares, print each square. Let's run it. Enter a number to square up to. Let's find all squares up to 10. So 1^2 is 1, 2 is 4, 32 is 9, 4 is 16, so on and so forth to 10, 10 squared is 100. Now we'll add an if condition. After the iterable, you can add an if condition. Let's return a value only if x is even. To check to see if a number is even, you can write the following code. If x modulus 2 modulus gives you the remainder of any division. If x is odd modulus 2 it returns 1. If it's even it returns zero. So if x modulus 2 equals z that means x is even in this case. Let's change the name of the object returned to us. We'll name this even squares. It only holds the squares of even numbers. Let's test that again. Enter a number to square up to 10 2 4 2 6 2 8 2 10 squared. So with a generator expression, you can add an if condition, too. All right, everybody. So those are generator expressions. They're similar to a list comprehension. They create a generator that yields values one at a time. And well everybody, those are generator expressions in Python."
c9vhHUGdav0,Learn Matplotlib in 1 hour! 📊,2025-10-09T14:01:03Z,"Hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to teach you everything you need to know to get started working with Mattplot Lib. So, I encourage you to sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Mattplot Lib is a Python library for creating charts and graphs. You can take plain numbers and turn them into visuals you can actually understand. With just a couple lines of code, you can make your first graph. Boom. Instant line graph. You can create line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and my favorite, pie charts, because I like pie. You can customize the appearance of what your charts look like, too. Here, I went a little crazy with the customization, but I think you get the idea. What I would recommend before starting the series, be familiar with all Python subjects up to dictionaries. Knowing numpy and pandas are helpful, but not necessary for this series. I do have some free courses on YouTube to catch you up to speed if you're interested. Anyways, let's begin. Oh yeah, let's do this. To start working with mattplot lib, we have to be sure that we have the library installed. One easy way to check that at the top of your IDE, if you were to import mattplot lib, if it's underlined red, you can hover your cursor over it and install the package by clicking this link. Now, if this popup doesn't appear, if you're using PyCharm, you can open up a terminal. Alt F12 is the shortcut. Then use pip to install Mattplot LIIB. pip install Mattplot LIIB. Enter. Give it a moment to install. And that's all you got to do. We can close out of this terminal. And that red underline should go away. To check the current version within a print statement, we will print access the library of mattplot lib dot dunder meaning double underscore version dunder. Again, the current version of mattplot lib that I'm using is 3.10.6. We can delete this print statement. There's a module called pipplot. It's found within the library of mattplot liib. It provides a userfriendly interface for plotting. We're going to import that module by following mattplot lib with pi plot. So al together import mattplot lib do import matt import mattplot.pipplot. That's a tongue twister. Just so we don't have to type this long name every time. We're going to give it an alias or nickname as plt for short. So in order to access here we go mattplot lib.pipplot. We're just going to give it a nickname of plt. Here's how we can create a basic plot. We'll need a set of x and ycoordinates. We'll start with a basic Python list. For the xcoordinates, we'll say x equals a python list. Here you can type in some numbers. I'm going to type in some years 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. And then for the y-coordinates, this will be a separate Python list. Make up some numbers. Uh in this scenario, let's pretend that we have different class sizes each year. Starting with 2023, there's a class size of 15 students. Then for 2024, we have 25 students, then 30 and 20. Feel free to pick different numbers if you would like. We have a list of x coordinates and a list of y-coordinates. Each set of these elements is a pair of x and y coordinates. We have to be sure that they match. Now to create a basic plot, we're going to access plt dot call the plot function and then pass in our coordinates x, y. The first argument is for the points on the xaxis. The second argument is for the coordinates on the y-axis. Now, if I were to run this, nothing displays. You also need to call the show function of your plot. Here's how. When we would like to show our plot, we will access plt call the show function in order to show our plot. Now I'm using PyCharm. My plot appears on the right hand side in a separate window called plots. Here's my x-axis with all of my years, but we'll have to do some customization in a future topic. Then here are all the y-coordinates. For 2023, we have 15. 2024 is 25. 2025 is 30. And 2026 is 20. And you can change these coordinates, too. I don't know. I'll set 30 to instead be a,000. Let's see what this looks like. And we get a different plot, but I'll change that back. You can also close out of past versions of plots by hitting this X button next to each. Now, for the plot function, if you only pass in a single parameter, this argument would be for points on the Y ais. And here's what that would look like. The default behavior for plot is to start at zero and place a point at each increment of one. 1 2 3. But each of these ticks, they increment by.5 each. The points on the xaxis will be provided to you. But we'll pass in both x and y. Now, if you're familiar with numpy, we could instead use numpy arrays because they're faster than python lists. To set that up, we will import numpy as np for short. We'll assign x to be a numpy array. nparray function and then pass in your Python list. Then do the same thing with y. nparray pass in your Python list. And that's all you have to do. Numpy arrays are faster than Python lists and give you more functionality. Your homework is in the comment section. either post two lists or two numpy arrays. Try and think of something creative if you can. All right, everybody. And that is an introduction to creating basic plots in mattplot lib. In this video, I'm going to show you how we can start customizing our plots. More specifically, we'll be customizing the lines and markers. Here's how. Within our plot function, we can pass one of a few keyword arguments. one of which is marker. Marker equals a given character. Depending on the character that you set for marker, your marker will be one of a few symbols. For example, if your marker set to be a period, a point, each set of coordinates has a point, although it's a little hard to see. I'll try and zoom in. You can see that each set of coordinates has a point. Another is circle. That would be an O. Triangle down is a V. For a star, you can use an asterisk. These are a few markers you can use, but not all of them. If you read the documentation, there's a fairly extensive list for our project. For the marker, we'll set it to be a dot, a period. But then you can change the marker size if this is too small. That will be a separate keyword argument. For the keyword argument of marker size, pick a size. Here's what 10 looks like. Here's 20. 30. What's a th00and look like? I'm curious. No, go back. Go back. Go back. We'll set it to be 30. For the marker size, it can be abbreviated to MS. MS meaning marker size. But for teaching purposes, I'll keep this as marker size just because it's easier to read and understand. Here's how to change the marker colors. This is a separate keyword argument. Marker face color. And here you can pick a color. You can select the name of a color. You can use RGB values, hexodimal values, or HSL values. Let's start with something simple like the name of a color such as cyan. The markers are now this color, cyan. But for better customization, I recommend looking up a color picker. So, here's a color picker that we could use. I would like a very specific shade of blue. Something like that's pretty good. I'll just select this hexadimal value. We're going to paste that hexadeimal value and rerun this program. And now we have a very specific shade of blue for the marker face color for this keyword. You can also shorten this to MFC. It's shorter but not as readable for a beginner. I'll keep it as is. Marker face color. Then for the edges, you can use marker edge color. I'll set it to be the same color, or you could pick a different color if you would like. We'll keep it the same. Now, the edges of each marker are the same color as the face. The abbreviated version of this word is M EC, in case you see it. Now, we'll start working with the lines. You can select a line style. The default is solid. Let's use a dashed line. Here's what it looks like. for the line. It's now dashed. Or we could do dotted dotted. We have a dotted line now. Or dash dot dash dot. It's a combination of dashes and dots. Or for no line, if you just want the points, the markers, you can set this to be none. Then we have no line, but let's set it to be solid. Solid. Here's how you can change the line width cuz right now it's fairly skinny. We will pass in a keyword argument of line width. Normally it's one, but here's what two looks like. I'll set this to be three. four. And I don't know what's 10 look like. That's a little too much. Let's set it to be four. Yeah, that's pretty decent. Here's how to change the line color. Set the color to be then pick a color. I'll use that color picker again. Let's see. I'll select something kind of dark blue like that. Copy and paste the color value. And here's what we got. Our line color is now a very specific shade. Now, let's say we have more than one line to customize. I'm going to create another numpy array. We'll rename y as y1. Plot x and y1. Then we will also have y 2. And I'll just do some copying and pasting. Y 2 will have some different values. Make up some values. I'll say, I don't know, 17, 23, 38, and I don't know, five. Again, your values don't have to be the same as mine. Feel free to pick some different numbers. We're plotting X and Y1, but we'll also plot X and Y 2. That set of coordinates. access plt. Call the plot function. Pass in x and y 2. So now we have two lines, but our second line doesn't have the same customizations as our first line. Here's one option, although I don't recommend it. You could copy and paste all of these keyword arguments and pass them in. This would work, although here's a much better option. You could instead create a dictionary with all of these keyword arguments. And then when we plot a line, we can just unpack our dictionary. Here's how we can do that. Let's create a dictionary which we'll name line style. This will equal call the dictionary function. To create a dictionary, we'll cut all of these keyword arguments and then place them within this dictionary function. Now we could just pass in this dictionary when we plot a line. We just have to unpack it using double asterisks. Unpack the line style dictionary. Then it's as if we're passing in all of these individual keyword arguments. We'll do this for the second line as well. unpack our line style dictionary and it's the same. Let's create a third line. We'll name this line Y3. This will be another numpy array. Make up some values 13, then 15, 20, and 30. Then we'll have to plot this line. Access plt. Call the plot function. pass in our new coordinates x and y3. Then we will unpack our dictionary of line style. Then we should have a third line, which we do. All of these lines are the same color. That's because with our dictionary of lines style, we've set all the colors to be the same, but you could pass in an individual color. Think of this as the default color for all lines if we use the line style dictionary. Another option is that we can cut this keyword attribute of color and then pass that as a separate keyword argument as well as the line style dictionary after unpacking it. So let's pass in a color then pick a color. I'll keep the first line to be blue. For the second line I'll pick a different color. Let's go with something green. That's good. We'll pass in a different color for the second line. Then for the third line, I'll pass in a color that's red. That's good. And now each of our lines has a different color. All right, everybody. So that is some basic plot customization. In the next video, we'll discuss labels. To help increase engagement with this video, comment down below what your favorite food is. And well everybody, that is an introduction to plot customization using Mattplot LIIB. All right, everybody. In this next section, we're going to customize various labels, our title, and the ticks of our chart. Here's how we can customize those. In this demonstration, I have various class sizes yearbyear, the years 2023 through 2026. These are all numpy arrays, but you can use Python lists, too. To set a title, we're going to access plt. Call the title function, and then we can pass in a title as a string. We'll set the title to be class size. Then we will run this, and we should have a title. class size. Although it's kind of small and hard to read. Here's how we can customize it further. We can pass in some keyword arguments. One of which is font size. To change the font size, I'll set that to be 20. Here's the new title. You can also change the font family, and it's just family. I'll pick Ariel. That's a professional looking font. You can set the font weight to be bold. Font weight equals the word bold. Let me make the title a little bit bigger. Let's say 25. That's better. Let's also set a color for our title. Color equals. Here you can pick the name of a color. You can use RGB values. You can use hexodimal values. I'll pick something kind of dark blue like that. I'll copy the hex value and then set the keyword argument of color to be that hexodimal value. And now our title should be a specific shade of blue. Now we'll set a label for the x-axis. We will access plt call the function of x label. We'll set the label to be year. And we should have a label on the x-axis for year. Although it's kind of small. We'll change the font size. We'll copy the font size from our title, but set it to be 20. Here's the new font size. Let's change the font family. I'll pick Ariel again. I'll set the font weight to be bold. And then I'll pick a color. I'll pick a lighter shade of blue. Let's try that. Color equals that specific shade of blue. Yeah, not bad. The label is kind of close to the border. We'll be adjusting the margin a little bit later in this topic. To create the label on the Y-axis, I'm just going to copy everything within this X label function. Paste it. Change X to Y. We'll say the text will be let's change the text of the label to be students as in number of students. We should have a similar label on the Y ais. Now we're going to customize the ticks of our graph. Each of these ticks is incrementing by.5 each. You can kind of see that here. You can force ticks to only display at these values for the x-axis. Here's how. We'll access plt. Call the x tick function. x tick. then pass in our list or numpy array that we're using for the x-axis. So now we have ticks only at each given year 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026. Now to customize the ticks, we will access PLT call the tick params function, meaning tick parameters. To select an axis, you'll select the keyword argument of access. You can select X, you can select Y, or you can select both. We'll select both. We're going to select colors plural, not singular. I'll select the same color as my labels. Now, the ticks should be blue. All right, everybody. So, that is how to add various labels to your plots in Mattplot Lib. Hey everybody, I have a super quick video today on how to create grid lines using the grid function using Mattplot LIIB. The grid function creates grid lines. They help make plots easier to read by adding reference lines. We'll need some sample data to work with. We'll just make something up. On the xaxis, we'll have 1 2 3 4 5. On the y-axis, we'll have 5 10 15 20 25. It really doesn't matter. We're more focused on the grid lines today. We'll need a plot access plt. Call the plot function. Pass in x. Pass in y. Then access plot. Call the show function to show our plot. Here's our sample plot. Now, let's say you would like to create some grid lines. For better readability, here's how. We're going to access plt call the grid function. Let's see what happens if we don't pass in any arguments. These are the grid lines with no customization. We have grid lines on the x-axis and the y-axis. If you would just like a single axis, you can specify that with the keyword argument axis equals. We'll pick the x-axis to begin with. We will only have vertical lines then on the x-axis by setting the axis to x. If we were to set this to y, we would have grid lines on the y-axis. You can change the line width. Line width equals. Normally, it's one, but here's two. The lines are a little bit thicker. Here's three. Let's set that back to two. You can change the color. Color equals, then select a color. I'll just pick light gray to keep it simple. The lines are now light gray. You can specify a line style. Normally, it's solid. Let's try dashed. Here's dashed. Here's dotted. Here's dash dot. But let's set this back to dashed. All right, everybody. That is a super quick lesson on how to create grid lines using mattplot lib. All right, everybody. For this topic, we're going to create a bar chart. A bar chart compares categories of data by representing each category with a bar. Here's an example that I thought of. You know the food pyramid? We'll create a bar chart to represent daily consumption of categories of foods. Here are the different categories. This will be a Python list. Categories equals. We'll create a Python list. The first element within this list will be grains such as bread. Then fruit, vegetables, protein, dairy, and sweets. We'll create another Python list of values for each of these categories. What value should each of them have? Let's pretend that these values are for daily servings. How many in each category did I consume today? We'll make up some numbers. For grains, this will be four. Fruit, three. Vegetables, I don't eat very many vegetables, that will be two. Lots of protein, that's a five. Dairy, three. And sweets, one. But feel free to make up your own numbers. Now, although it's not necessary, I'm going to convert these Python lists to be numpy arrays. All right, we are ready to make a bar chart. Categories will be on the xaxis, values will be on the y-axis. Rather than using a plot such as plt called the plot function, we're instead going to use bar to make a bar chart. First pass in what's going to be used for the x-axis categories, comma, then the y-axis of values. And then you do have to show your bar chart. plt call the show function. And let's see what we have. Here we go. A bar chart compares categories of data by representing each category with a bar. Here are the categories that we've stated. grains, fruit, vegetables, protein, dairy, sweets. And here are the values on the lefth hand side for each. Let's add a title and two labels to our bar chart. PLT call the title function, then pass in a title as a string. We'll say daily consumption. Let's make sure that works. Yes, it does. We'll add a label to the x-axis. plt x label. We'll say the word food. Yep, it says food. And you can change the size if you want for these labels, but that might be overkill for this lesson. We've already covered that in the previous topic. PLT call the Y label function. We'll pass in a string that says quantity and it should say that on the lefth hand side. Now let's change the color of our bar chart. When we call the bar function, we can set the color to be a color of your choice. You can pick a color name. You can use hexodimal values. I'll just say sky blue. And the bar colors should change. Now, if you would like a horizontal bar chart, I'll comment this line of code out. Copy it, paste it, you're going to instead call the bar H function for a horizontal bar chart, which looks a little something like this. But honestly, for me, I prefer the vertical bar chart. All right, everybody. So that is how to create a basic bar chart using mattplot lib. All right everybody we are now going to create a bar chart using mattplot liib. A bar chart it's a circular chart divided into slices to show percentages of the total. It's good for visualizing distribution among categories. In this demonstration, we're going to create a fictional college. There will be four classes, freshman, sophomore, junior, senior. We'll create a Python list of categories. We'll have freshman, sophomores, I think I misspelled that, juniors, and seniors. We'll also create a Python list of the number of students in each class. Values equals a Python list. We'll have 300 freshmen in our college, 250 sophomores, 275 juniors, and 225 seniors. If you're familiar with numpy, you do have the option to convert any numerical Python lists to numpy arrays. Although for a list of four values, it's not really too beneficial. If this were a larger data set, we would benefit from numpy arrays more, but it would be a good habit for us to develop. Now, Python list of strings don't really benefit from numpy arrays. We'll keep that as is. We have the two collections that we need, categories and values. To create a pie chart, we will access plt, call the pi function, pass in our values. Let me show you what just passing in values will look like. We will also call the show function. plt.show function. We do have the distributions, but we don't have any labels. Here's how to set the labels. When we call the pi function, we will pass in a few keyword arguments. The first will be labels. What are the labels of our pie chart? The labels will be the categories that we have. Labels equals categories. And we should have some categories for each of these pie slices. Freshman, sophomores, juniors, seniors. You can add some percentages to each of these pie slices. Here's how. That's going to be another keyword argument. The keyword argument is auto PCT. This means auto percentage. We have to set this equal to a formatting instruction. We're going to use percent one f. Let's see what we have. All right. We don't need all these digits after the decimal. Let's limit that. After one, we'll add 0.1 to display one digit after the decimal. 28.6 23.8 8 26.2 21.4. To add a percent sign after, we'll use double percent signs cuz normally using one percent sign is a format specifier. Okay, now there's a percent sign after each of these numbers. Here's how to set the colors for each pie slice. We'll create another list for convenience, which I will name colors. Colors equals. Then in order of your categories, place a color within here. You can choose a color name, RGB values, hexodimal values. We'll just keep it simple and pick some color names. Freshman will be red, sophomores will be yellow, juniors will be blue, seniors will be green. And then we do have to pass that in as a keyword argument. Set colors equal to our list of colors. And the colors should change. Freshman are red, sophomores are yellow, juniors are blue, seniors are green. Let's add a title to our pie chart. PLT called the title function. Pass in a title. My college will be named Broode College because I think I'm cool. You can explode one of these pie slices. Explode means to displace it slightly. If you need to highlight a pie slice, we'll explode seniors. For the keyword argument of explode, we'll set this equal to a Python list. We have four categories. We'll need four values. I'll set each of these to be zero. I need to explode seniors. I'll set this to a value that's not one. Let's start with 0.1. The greater the number, the further the distance that pi slice will explode. Here's 0.1. Let's change that to 0.2. The distance traveled should be a little bit greater. Here's.3. We'll set that to be 02. That's pretty good. And 0.1. We can also add a drop shadow. shadow equals true. And there should be a drop shadow for each pie slice. To rotate your pie chart, you'll set start angle to be some angle. If I were to set this to be 180 for 180°, my pie chart is going to rotate by 180°. I'll just set that to be let's check out 90. That's pretty good. All right, everybody. So that is how to create a basic pie chart using mattplot liib. All right everybody in this video we're going to discuss scatter graphs in mattplot lib. Scatter graphs show the relationship between two variables. They help to identify a correlation positive negative or no correlation. For example the more hours you study the higher your test scores tend to be. That's a positive correlation. Scatters help us identify those correlations. In this demonstration, I'll create the following data set. You can either follow along and type what I'm about to type or look in the comment section. I'll try and post this data set. We'll have X, which will be a Python list. These will be hours studied for various students. We'll have 10 values. The first student didn't study at all. They studied zero hours. Another studied 1 hour. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 8. Feel free to make up some numbers too. It really doesn't make a difference. Then y will be the test scores. This will be another Python list. The student that didn't study at all, they got a 55% on their test score. The first value will be 55. Then another got 60. 65. 62. 68 70 75 78 82 85 87. That's good enough for now. To create a scatter graph, we're going to access PLT. Call the scatter function. Pass in X. Then pass in Y. X is for the hours studied. Y is for the grades. What grade did they get on their test score? Then in order to show this graph, we have to call the show function. plt.show function. Let's see what we have. Here is our scatter graph. You can see that there's a positive correlation between our studied and the exam scores. Let's add some labels to our scatter graph. For the X label access plt, call the X label function. Then pass in a string to serve as the label. Hours studied is good. Let's make sure that that works. Yes, it does. We have a label for hours studied. For the y-axis, call the y label function. Then pass in a string. We'll say grades or grade singular. Let's make sure that that works. Yes, it does. Here's the grade. Then let's add a title plt. Call the title function. I'm going to say test scores just as a general title for our scatter graph. Let's add a little bit of customization. Let's change the color. This will be a keyword argument. color equals some color. You can pick a color name. You can use RGB values. I'll just say sky blue to keep it simple. And the color should change, which it does. You can also change the alpha. Alpha is related to the transparency. If I set alpha to be 0.5, that's 50%. The transparency is going to change, although it's a little hard to see. If I set alpha to be 0.1, then the transparency is 10% and you can barely see it. I'll keep it at 50%. Let's change the size of our dots on our scatter graph. That would be S for size. Let's check out 100. That's bigger. Here's 200. Yeah, we can keep it at 200. That's a good size. Okay, let's create another data set. The following set of scores will be for one class. We'll add another class of scores. Although it's not necessary, I forgot to make these numpy arrays. You can if you would like. Let's rename x to be x1, y to be y1. Pass in x1, and y1. We're going to create a whole another set. Let's copy and paste x1 and y1. Rename them as X2 and Y2. And let's change some of these values around. For the second set, we'll have 0 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. Then for the exam scores for the second class, we'll have 50 58 65 70 72 78 83 88 92 95 97. We're going to call the scatter function again. We'll copy and paste what we had previously, but pass in X2 and Y2, the second set of coordinates. Let's change the color to be red. The blue set of dots is for class one. The red set of dots is for class 2. Based on this graph, we can't tell without a legend. The legend will tell you which class is which. But we'll need some labels. We'll pass those in as keyword arguments. For class one, we'll set label equal to class A. And then for our second class, this will be class B. Label equals class B. But then we have to show the legend because it's not visible. Access PLT. Call the legend function. Then we should have a legend within our scatter graph. Class A is the blue dots. Class B is the red dots. All right, everybody. So those are scatter graphs. They show relationships between two variables. For example, hours studied and exam grades. The more hours you study, the better grade you tend to get. That's a positive correlation, which we can see from this graph here. And well everybody those are scatter graphs using mattplot liib. Yo hey everybody in this video I'm going to explain histograms in mattplot lib. Histograms are a visual representation of the distribution of quantitative data. In short we can visualize the distribution of data. Histograms group values into bins. Think of these like intervals. will count how many fall in each range in each bucket or bin. Histograms are great for statistics and probability. In many cases, you'll see a bell curve distribution. Now, in this demonstration, I recommend using NumPy cuz we'll need a lot of data to work with. With NumPy, we can generate some random numbers. Here's how we can do that. We're going to create some test scores. We're a teacher and we have 100 students that each took a test. We'll create a visual to display the distribution of scores. We'll create a numpy array of scores. Scores equals np accessis random. Then call the normal function for a normal distribution. There's a few keyword arguments here we'll pass in. The first is loc. LOC equals loc is the location of the center, the median of our data. For the center, we'll say that the median is 80 80%. All of the test scores are going to cluster around this score of 80. Most students will do pretty well. If this were a lower score like 50, that means most of the students failed. That's because the most frequent score is going to be around 50%. We'll set that to be 80. Now, we'll need a scale. This is another keyword argument. Scale equals scale is the standard deviation, the spread. How far away are the scores going to deviate from the center? The higher the number, the greater the deviation. Let's start with 10. And then we need a size. How many numbers do we want to generate? We'll set size equal to 100. We have 100 test scores. Let's test what we have currently. We'll access plt. Call the hist function for a histogram. Pass in our numpy array of scores. Then we do have to call the show function to show our histogram. access plt called call the show function. Here's what a histogram looks like. We set the center to be 80. Scores around that number are going to be the most frequent. And we've set the scale to be 10. 10 is the standard deviation. That's a statistics and probability term. How far away will the scores deviate from the center? Now, if I set the scale to be a small number like one, the scores are going to cluster more closely to 80. The lowest score was 77. The highest score was 82. If I set scale to be a big number, like 50. Well, then the scores really deviate from the center of 80. We have some students that scored below zero and others above 200. Let's set that back to 10. Just to ensure that no scores go below zero or above 100, we can use the clip function. We'll reassign our numpy array of scores. Access numpy. Call the clip function. We have to pass in our numpy array of scores. For any scores below zero, we'll set them to be zero. We'll clip them. For any scores above 100, we'll clip them down to 100. It's kind of like we're setting the bounds, the minimum and the maximum. All scores below zero will be set to zero. All scores above 100 will be set to 100. Let's set the scale back to something massive like 50. Yep, there's no scores below zero and no scores above 100. But we don't need a scale that big. Let's add some customization. You can set the number of bins that you want as another keyboard argument. This will be within the hist function for a histogram. I'll set the number of bins to be 10. We should now have 10 bins or intervals. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. If I were to set this to 20, we would now have 20. But I think 10 is a good number. Let's change the color. That's another keyword argument. Color equals pick a color. I'll just set my histogram to be light green. There we go. To better define the edges, you can set an edge color because right now it kind of looks like one massive blob. Edge color equals I'll set it to be black. We should get a nice outline around each interval or bin. Let's add some labels because well, I forgot to do that. Let's add a title. plt called the title function. We'll say exam scores. Let's make sure that that works. Yes, it does. Let's set a label for the x-axis. plt call the x label function. We'll say score. Here we go. Score. And for the y-axis, plt call the y label function. Number of students. Number of students is on the y- axis. All right, everybody. So, that's a histogram. It's a visual representation of the distribution of quantitative data. We're displaying the distribution of data. And well, everybody, those are histograms in Mattplot Lib. Yo. Hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to show you how we can create subplots using Mattplot Lib. There's a couple definitions we'll need to cover. One of which is a figure. A figure is the entire canvas in which we add a plot to. Then we have an ax. An ax is also known as a subplot. It's a single plot within a figure. A figure can contain multiple axes or subplots. We're going to call a subplots function. It's going to return a tpple that has a few things inside of it. Just to demonstrate temporarily, I'm going to print access plt call the subplots function. Within the subplots function, we're going to determine the layout of our figure. How many rows and columns of subplots will be within our figure? For example, we could have a 2x two, two rows, two columns. Or 2x3, two rows, three columns, or a 3x two, three rows, two columns. Let's stick with the 2x two for now. I want to show you what this function returns exactly. It's a little complex, but we'll break it down. The subplots function, it will return a tpple. The tpple has two entities, a figure object, which is our canvas, and a two-dimensional array of axes objects. When we call this function, we're going to unpack this tupler right away. Rather than use print, we're going to assign what's returned to us and unpack it. We'll create a figure object and an axis object. figure and axes equals call the subplots function. Figure is our canvas. We won't actually be using it in this topic, but we're provided with it by the subplots function. We'll print this two-dimensional list right away. Here's how we'll plot each of these subplots, but we won't add any data quite yet. Not until later. If I was to call the show function, we can see all the subplots that we have. access plt. Call the show function. We have four subplots, two rows, two columns. If this were a 1x two, one row, two columns, we have two subplots. Or a 2x 1, which would be two rows, one column. A 3x3 would be three rows, three columns. We don't need that many subplots, but I think you get the idea. We'll have a 2x two. Two rows, two columns. We'll fill each of these individual subplots in. Here's how. We'll start with the top left corner. Row 0, column 0. We'll access our 2D list of axes at row 0, column 0, and then plot it calling the plot function. We will need some data. We'll keep it simple. We'll say x equals a numpy array with a list that contains 1 2 3 4 5. We'll plot x. But to keep it simple, we'll just say y will be x * 2. Let's take a look. We've selected the subplot at row 0, column 0. So only this one is filled in with our data. Let's customize it. Let's set the color to be red with a keyword argument. The color is now red. And let's add a title. We need to select that specific subplot using a set of indices axes at row 0, column 0. Call the set title function. Then pass it a title. We'll say x 2 for the title. And there's the title for this specific subplot. Now we'll plot the top right subplot. We need to select that specific one. That would be row 0, column 1. We'll call the plot function. Pass in x. We'll say x to the^ of two for the y-axis. Select a color. I'll select blue. Then set the title axis at row 0 column 1. We will set the title to be x to the^ of two. The top right subplot should now be plotted. All right. Let's select the bottom left corner that will have different indices. axes at row one, column zero. We'll call the plot function. Pass in x. For y, we'll say x to the power of three. We'll set the color to be green. Then set a title axis at indices of 1, 0. Call the set title function. This will be x to the^ of three. Oops, looks like I misspelled color. There we go. Some of these subplots are overlapping. You can add a tight layout so everything fits. Access plt. Call the tight layout function. And now they should all fit in place, which they do. Let's finish this bottom right corner. I'll just copy and paste the last two lines. That would be axes at row one, column 1. This will be x ^ 4. The color will be purple. Axes at row 1, column 1. We'll set the title to be x to the^ of 4. There we go. We have now filled in the bottom right corner. Now, if this were a 3x3, well, then only these four subplots are still filled in, but we really don't need that many. Now, you don't necessarily need to use plots. You could use different graphs instead such as a bar chart or whatever else you would like. All right, everybody. And that is how to create subplots using mattplot lib. Yo. Hey everybody. In this video, we're going to integrate both pandas and mattplot lib. In my panda series, we've been working with the CSV file that contains the stats for the original 150 Pokémon. We'll be reusing that in this series. Or if there's another set of data that you would like to work with, feel free to use that, too. I'll post this in the comment section on YouTube and you can just copy and paste it if you would like. Just be sure to put it in a CSV file. To work with pandas, we'll need to import it. Import pandas. We'll give it a nickname as pd for short. When we read a CSV file, we're going to assign it to be a dataf frame, which we will name df. df equals access pandas as pd. call the read CSV function and then pass in the name of that file or a file path. The name of my file is data.csv. And it's right next to my main Python file. I don't need a file path beforehand. Let's be sure that it works. I'm going to print my data frame. Here are all the stats of the original 150 Pokémon. It's a truncated view though, but that's good enough. We'll create a bar chart that shows the quantity of the primary types. For example, there's grass types, there's fire types, dragon types, so on and so forth. We'll be selecting only a single column, a single series, type one. There is a secondary type of type two, but we won't be concerned with that in this video. To select a single column, we'll be using the subscript operator, which is a set of straight brackets. Then select the column. We will select type one. That is the primary type. We'll be returned with a single series, a single column. There is a built-in function of series. It's called value counts. And this is a function. This function will return the number in each category. So, if I were to run this, we would have a total of 28 water types, 22 normal types, 14 poison types, 12 fire types, and a whole bunch more. We'll plot the quantity of each type. The index we'll put on the y-axis with a horizontal bar chart, and the values we'll place on the x-axis. Now for convenience I'm going to assign our value counts. We'll say type count equals this series. Type count will be a series. It will hold the amount of each type. Now to create a bar chart, we'll access plt. Call the bar function. We'll create a horizontal bar chart in just a moment. For the x-axis, we'll access our series of type count, but I would like just the index. We don't need the entire series. And for the y-axis, we'll need the values. Take our series of type count. Access the values. Let's see what we have currently. We'll do a test run. Be sure to show your plot because I forgot to do that. There we go. Here's our bar chart. But we have a little bit of work to do. All of these index names are grouped together. Let's place them on the x-axis with a horizontal bar chart. We'll use a horizontal bar chart with bar h. That's a lot better. Now they're in ascending order. I would like the values with the most on the top rather than the bottom. Well, when we create our type count series, we can pass in a keyword argument. Ascending equals true. And they should now be in reverse order. You can change the colors if you would like. Pass in a keyword argument of color. Then pick a color. I'll use a hex color picker. I'll pick something blue. That's pretty decent. I'll copy the hex value and then paste it within that color keyword argument. Not bad. I'll also add an edge color of black. Edge color equals black. Let's add a title and some labels. PLT call the title function. This title will be number of Pokemon by primary type. Let's make sure that it works. Yes, it does. For the x-axis, we'll say count. plt. Call the x label function. Pass in the word of count. There we are. Then for the y-axis axis plt call the y label function. Pass in a word of type. Just to make sure everything fits. We're going to call the tight layout function so that everything fits. plt call the tight layout function. And now everything should fit within our figure. All right everybody. So that served as a final project for us. That's how to use both pandas and mapplot lib together."
OUnnuKHbmbU,DataFrames in Pandas are easy! 🔢,2025-09-04T14:00:37Z,"All right, let's do this everybody. We got to talk about data frames. In pandas, a dataf frame is a tabular data structure with rows and columns. It's two-dimensional similar to an Excel spreadsheet. Here's a beginner friendly way in which we can create a data frame. Let's start with a dictionary. We'll say data equals a dictionary. For our data, we'll have some employees. For the key of name, this will be a column. Instead of just having a single value, we'll use a list, a Python list. Here, we can list a few different names. I'm going to use Spongebob characters because most people know who Spongebob is. We'll have Spongebob, Patrick, and Squidward. Then we'll add another column. This column will be for the age. How old is each employee? The value will be another Python list. I'm going to say that Spongebob is around 30. Patrick will be 35. Squidward will be 50. Let me just do a little bit of organizing there. That looks pretty good. Now, we're going to convert our dictionary into a dataf frame. Here's how. We will assign dataf frame, but most people shorten this to just df meaning dataf frame. our dataf frame object equals access pandas spd call the dataf frame constructor. Now the d is capital not lowercase that's because this is a constructor rather than a function. We're going to pass in our data, our dictionary. And then we will print our data frame which we have named DF for short. And here's our data frame. It's tabular data. It's made of rows and columns. We're also given an index. This index has a label for each row starting with zero. But you can set that to be something custom. To do so, when we construct a dataf frame object, we will set an index by passing in a keyword argument. index equals a Python list. We'll say employee 1, then employee 2, then employee 3, and we should have some new labels. There we go. Employee 1 is Spongebob, age30. Employee 2 is Patrick, age 35. Employee 3 is Squidward, age 50. If you need to select a single row, you can access the lock property. DF.Lock subscript operator. Lock means location by label. Give me all the data for employee one. That's the label. We are given Spongebob age 30. Here's the label and the data type of this row. It's an object. Let's select employee 2, Patrick, age 35. The label is employee 2. The data type for this row is an object. And employee 3, we have Squidward, age 50. Employee 3 data type is an object. Now you can also select by integer location by using the eyelock property. I lock. So the index zero will give you the first row which is again Spongebob. One is for Patrick. Two is for Squidward. Let's just print the entire data frame. Now if you need to add a new column, here's how. I'll just add a comment. Add a new column. And I'm just going to zoom out a little bit. To create a new column, we'll access our data frame. Use the subscript operator. Then we'll need to think of a new column name. Let's say job or position. What does everybody do? We will assign this to be a Python list. The number of values must match the number of rows. We have three rows, one for Spongebob, Patrick, and Squidward. In that order, what is the job of Spongebob? He is a cook. That's the first value. Let's say Patrick is a new employee. He doesn't have a position quite yet. For the time being, we'll say NA for not available. And then Squidward is a cashier. Now, let's print our data frame. And we should have a new column. Employee one is a cook. Employee two, their job is not available yet. And employee three, employee 3 is a cashier. That's how to make a new column. Now, how do we add a new row? Here's how. Add a new row. An easy way to create a new row is to create a new data frame, then concatenate it. We'll say new row equals access pandas spd call the dataf frame constructor again. Now we're going to pass in a list. For this list, you can add a dictionary for each new row you want to add. For example, if I need to add three rows, I'll need three dictionaries within this list. But for now, we'll just add one. This dictionary needs key value pairs. For the key of name, we'll add, let's say, Sandy. For the key of age, we'll add a value of 28. Then for the key of job, we'll add a value of I would say that SI is some sort of scientist or engineer, but we'll just say engineer. This is a separate data frame. It only contains a single row. a new record for Sandy. We're going to concatenate it to our existing dataf frame. We will reassign our data frame df equals access pandas spd. Call the concat function for concatenate. You may see people use append, but that's now depreciated. We'll be using concat for concatenation. We will pass in a python list. Then include all of the data frames we want to concatenate. We want to include our existing data frame and the new row. And then let's print our data frame. And we should have a new row. Yes, we have a new row for Sandy. However, we have not set an index. The index was set to zero. Well, we can manually update that. When we create a new data frame, you can pass in an index as a keyboard argument. We'll do that for Sandy. So, comma, space, and just for readability, I'll put this on a new line. index equals a Python list with a new label for her of employee 4. And here we go. Employee 4 is Sandy, age 28. Her job is an engineer. Now, you can add more than one row. Let's add new rows. This variable will be new rows. So within our list, we can add more than one dictionary. Let's add another row. I'll do some copying and pasting just to save a little bit of time. Copy all the key value pairs and paste it within the new dictionary. Let's say the new employee is Mr. Krabs. His first name is Eugene. Eugene Krabs. He seems like he's about 60. His job is that he is a manager. We'll assign him to be employee five. And then we are adding new rows to our data frame. All right, let's take a look. There they are. We have two new rows. One for Sandy and another for Eugene. Sandy is 28. She's an engineer. Eugene is 60. He's a manager. All right everybody, those are data frames. Dataf frames are a tabular data structure. They contain rows and columns. Your homework is in the comment section. To post the output of a dataf frame, try and think of a unique example if you can. And well everybody, those are dataf frames using pandas."
6WaBryk4fkE,Slicing in NumPy is easy! ✂️,2025-07-27T15:25:48Z,"Yo, hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to show you slicing using numpy. Let's get into it. We'll need an array to work with. For this demonstration, we'll create a 2D array. Array equals np. Call the array function. Then we'll pass in a 2D list. There will be four rows and four columns. So, within this list, we will have four nested lists. We'll have the numbers 1 through 16. That should be enough for this demonstration. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and 13 14 15 16. Just for readability, I'll put each row on a new line. There we go. We have a matrix of data, a 2D array. For array slicing, we'll be using the subscript operator. I'll add this as a comment. We will access our array. Use the subscript operator which is a set of straight brackets. Here we will write a slice expression. There's three options. You can list a starting index, an ending index, and a step. Each is separated with a colon, a slice operator. Let's give it a try. Let's say I would like the first row, the first row in my 2D array. Here's how I would print that. Within a print statement, I'm going to access our array. Use the subscript operator, which is a set of straight brackets. Then we will list where we would like to start. Let's access array at index zero. That's going to return the first row 1 2 3 4. Array at index 1 would be 5 6 7 8. Remember that with programming, we tend to start collections with an index of zero. So that's why the second row has an index of 1. The second index would be row 3. 9 10 11 12. Index 3 is 13 14 15 16. Then if we access for it's out of bounds. You can also use negative indexing. Array at index of -1 would give you the last row 13 14 15 16 or -2 would be the second to last row 9 10 11 12 that is the starting index at which element would you like to start you can also select a range we need both a start and an ending index let's select the first three we'll start at index zero colon that's the slice operator ator and end at three. Now the ending index it's exclusive. So if we need the first three that would be 0 1 2 3 that will give you indices 0 through two because the ending index is exclusive. We have row 0 1 2. Or perhaps I would like the first three rows after index zero or row zero so to say. Well, we'll start at one, then continue to four. We'll skip index zero and print the next three rows. If you would like to select everything up until the end, you can omit the second number, but you still need that colon. This tells Python select everything up until the end. Now, we'll introduce a step. Let's select every second row starting with the first row 0 and row two 0 colon 4. This will select rows 0 through three. Remember the ending index is exclusive. Give me every second row. We'll add a colon and then the step. We're counting by twos. This will give me row zero and row two. 1 2 3 4 9 10 11 12. If we're selecting all rows, you can omit the start and the end, but you still need those two colons. And the reason that you need them is because if we omit these, omit the colons, numpy thinks we're selecting the second index. So with those two colons, if we omit the start and the end, we're telling NumPy, select all rows. You can also set the step to be negative. This will return all the rows reversed. So we have the bottommost row 13 14 15 16 at the top and the rows are in reverse order. I'm actually curious what if you set this to -2. Oh, that's interesting. I didn't know that. Now the rows are in reverse order and we're selecting every second row. I actually didn't know that. I was just curious. I was wondering what would happen if I put -2 here. All right. So that is row selection. Now we'll get into column selection. Now we're going to get into column selection. We can select specific columns. This first column has an index of zero because with programming collections tend to have an index of zero to begin with. This next column would have an index of one. The third column has an index of two. And the fourth column has an index of three. When accessing our 2D array, we'll need two indices. for example 0 comma 0. The first index is for the row. The second index is for the column. Now if you would like to select all rows for the row selection, we're just going to add a colon because without it, we're going to have a syntax error. Invalid syntax. For the row selection, we do need something here. We're selecting all rows, then access column zero. That would give me 1 5 913. 1 5 913. Column 1 would be 26 1014. Column 2 is 3 7115. Column 3 is 48 1216. If I set the index to be -1, that's going to return the last column 481 1216. or the second to last column would be -2 3 7 1115 3 7 111 15 Now we'll select a range I would like the first three columns this would be column 0 column 1 column 2 we need a start and ending index we'll start at column zero so this number is going to be three because of the ending index index is exclusive. This will print the first three columns. We have 1 5 93 2 6 10 14 3 7 11 15. That is the first three columns. Now we'll skip the first column but print all the columns that come after. We'll start at column one or index of one so to say. continue to four. So we skip the first column. This one we're skipping it and print all the columns that come after. If you would like all columns until the end of your data, you can omit the step, but you still need that colon. That works as well. Now we'll select every second column by setting the step. We'll be given column zero and column two. We have 1 5 913 and 3 7 11 15. Now I would like every second column, but we'll start at column 1. That would be 2. This gives us 2 6 10 14 and 4 8 12 16. Then you can reverse the order of the columns. Set the step to be -1. We have 4 8 12 16 3 7 11 15 2 6 10 14 and 1 5 91 13. If our step was -2, this would be in reverse order, but we're given every second column. 4 8 12 16 210 14. Now, we're going to combine both row and column selection. We'll need two indices. Let's say that we would like the first two rows, but only the first two columns. We'll start with our row selection. We're starting at row 0 and end at row two. 0 col 2. Then for the column, we need the first two. 0 1 stop at two. 0 col 2. That's going to give me the first two columns of the first two rows. It's kind of like we're selecting a quadrant. This is a 4x4 matrix and I would like to select these four numbers. Now we'll select this quadrant. 3 4 7 8. Take a guess as to what you would have to write. We're selecting the first two rows. We can keep the selection the same for the rows, but for the columns, we're starting at let's see 0 1 2 2 colon 4. But since we're selecting all columns till the end, we can omit the second number. But we still need the colon. So we get 3 4 7 8. Now we'll select the last two rows, but the first two columns. What row are we going to start with? 0 1 2 continue to four. But since we're continuing to the end, we can omit the ending index. Now I would like the first two columns. That would be 0 col 2. That's going to give you this quadrant 9 10 134. Now we need the last two rows and the last two columns. We'll keep our row selection the same. Start at column, let's see, 012. Continue to four. But since we're continuing to the end, we can omit the second number. And we should get 11 12 15 16. This quadrant. All right, everybody. That is slicing in numpy. I can't think of any homework for you to do. So, to increase engagement for this video, why don't you post your favorite movie in the comment section down below? And well everybody that is slicing using numpy."
mjiHc965UME,Convert decimal to hexadecimal EASY!  #coding #programming #computerscience,2025-07-20T14:51:42Z,"Yo, hey everybody. In this video, I'm going to show you how we can convert a decimal number to hexadimal. Here's how. Let's say we have the decimal number of 896. Hexadimal is base 16. Hexa decimal. With our decimal number, all we got to do is repeatedly divide this number by 16. We'll take 8,96, divide this by 16. That gives us a quotient of 506. This does divide evenly. There is no remainder. Our remainder is zero. For the next step, we take the quotient. In this case, 56. 56 / 16. Again, the quotient is 31. 56 doesn't divide by 16 evenly. We have a remainder of 10. Take the quotient 31 / 16. Again, we have a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 15. Then we have one for our quotient. 1 / 16 equals 0. Since our quotient is 0, that's where we're going to stop. And we have a remainder of 1. We have to take all the remainders to get our hexadesimal number. The bottommost number is the most significant bit and the top is the least significant bit. With our remainder values, they can only be single digits. Here we have a 10 and a 15. According to this chart, we have 0= 0 all the way till 9= 9. We have single letters to represent numbers. A corresponds to 10. B corresponds to 11 all the way till F which corresponds to 15. 15 is actually F 10 is A. 8,96 converted to hexadimal is 1 F A 0. And that's how to convert decimal to hexadimal."

Normally with decimal digits, they range in values between 0 through 9. But with hexadimal, we have some letters, too. We have the letters A through F. Here's a key. Starting with 0, 0= 0, 1= 1, all the way till 9. 9= 9. But we also have letters to represent single digits. A= 10, B= 11, C= 12, all the way to F which equals 15. Each of these letters has a corresponding value. Hexadimal is base 16. To convert this hexadimal value to decimal, we'll follow this pattern. Starting from the right and working our way towards the left, we will multiply each digit by powers of 16. With the first digit, we'll multiply 9 * 16 to the power of 0. Then we'll multiply a. Remember according to that key a= 10 multiply 10 * 16 ^ of 1 f had a corresponding value of 15 15 * 16 to the^ of 2 and then 2 * 16 to the^ of 3 16 ^ of 0 is just 1 9 * 1 gives us 9. According to that key, a equ= 10. 10 * 16 is 160. F has a value of 15. 15 * 16^ 2ar that is 3,840. And then 2 * 16 to the^ of 3 that is 8,192. Then we just have to add these numbers together. 8,192 + 3,840 + 160 + 9. That will give us a decimal value of 12,201 in decimal. And that's how to easily convert hexadimal values to decimal."

Binary numbers are either a 0ero or a 1. Decimal numbers are 0 through 9. With a binary number, the digit most to the right is the least significant bit. The digit most to the left is the most significant bit. When converting a binary number to decimal, I like to think of it like a point system. Starting with the least significant bit and working our way towards the left. The first digit is worth one point. The next digit is worth double the amount of points as the previous two. Two doubled is four. Four doubled is eight. And we would just continue with this pattern. Reading our binary number. If one of these digits contains a one, we get some number of points. Then we would add all of our points together. 128 + 32 + 8 + 2 + 1 gives us a decimal number of 171. And that's how to read binary in roughly 60 seconds."

ZwSyuqbeN0c,Arrays of structs are easy! 🗄️,2025-04-25T14:37:00Z,"Hey y everybody. In this video, I'm going to explain how arrays of strrus work in C. An array of strrus is an array where each element contains a strruct, a strruct data structure. If you have a lot of strrus to work with and they're all of the same type, you can stick them within an array. By doing so, it helps you organize and group together related data. Here's an example. The type will be cars cuz I like cars. To create a strct, we'll type strrruct. Then a tag name for this strct will say car curly braces semicolon. Let's say that all cars have the following members. A character array of model. I'll set that to be a max size of 25 characters. An int of year for the year and an int of price. All right, let's create a few car strus. To create a car strruct, you would have to type strruct car. Then a name for the strruct. We could say car one. If we use the type defaf keyword, we don't have to preede each instance of car with strruct that keyword. We'll say typed defaf strruct. Then move the tag name to the end car. And then we don't need to precede car with the word strruct. That's just going to make it convenient for us. All right, let's initialize the members of car one. Pick a car that you like. I like Mustangs. I'll set this to be a Mustang for the model. A year. I'll say 2025. Then a price 32,000 for $32,000. Let's create a few more cars. Car car 2 equals. Then we'll initialize the members. For my second car, I'll pick a Corvette. The year will be 2026. And the price will be $68,000. It's really expensive. Then a third car. Car car 3 equals I'll pick a Challenger. The year will be 2024. The price will be $29,000. Okay, we have a few strrus. They're not within an array yet. Let's display their members. We can use print f for this. print f. We'll display the model first, which is a string. We need a format specifier of percent s. Then the year, that's an integer. Then the price, it's an integer. But I'll precede it with the dollar sign if we're working with American dollars. Then we will access car 1's model. Car 1 dom car 1.ear year car 1. Then I'll add a new line. Let's see what we have currently. All right, here's car 1. It's a car strruct. Here's the model, the year, and the price. Those members. Then let's display car 2 and car 3. We can do some copying and pasting. For the second print f statement, let's replace car one with car 2 and the third print statement with car 3. All right, here's our car strrus. We have three car strrus each with a model, a year, and a price. Now, what we could do is store all of these car strrus within an array for convenience and better organization. Here's how. When we declare an array, we have to list the data type first. While we're storing car strrus, the data type is car. Then we need a name for this array. We'll say cars plural. Then a set of straight brackets because it's an array. Equals. With arrays, we enclose all elements with a set of curly braces. For each strct, we're going to cut everything within the set of curly braces, including the curly braces. then paste it within our array. This would be one element. Each element is going to be commaepparated. So, we'll finish doing some copying and pasting. And just for readability, I'll put these each on a new line. And we can delete our previous declarations. There we go. It's kind of similar to a 2D array. However, if I were to run this, well, car 1, car 2, and car 3 no longer exist. To access these strrus, we're going to access them by an index using a for loop. Here's how. For our for loop, we'll need to calculate the number of elements we have. We'll say int number equals call the size of function pass in array of strrus divided by one of the elements size of cars at index zero. Now we're going to create a for loop int i equals z. We'll continue while i is less than the number of elements we have. I is less than number. In this case, we have three elements. Number is going to be three for this example. Increment I by one. We can cut one of these print f statements and paste it within the for loop. And then delete them. We no longer need them. Replace any instance of car 1 with the name of our array at a given index number. Cars at index i. So, let's go ahead and replace all these. And this should work. We're accessing our array by an index number. If we access cars at index i and get the model, well, during the first cycle, we're accessing this array of cars index zero. That's the first element. Return the model. Then we're doing that with the year, then the price. Then during the next cycle, we go down to the next element because we're incrementing i. And let's try this. This should work. And there we go. Here's our array of strrus. We have car 1, car 2, and car 3. All right, everybody. That is an array of strrus in C. It's where you have an array and each element is a strruct. It helps keep your code organized and you can group together related data. And well everybody, that's how array of strrus work in C."
rUXjvybSPWc,Realloc in C explained easy! 🚢,2025-04-22T15:10:16Z,"Yo, what's going on people? In this video, I'm going to explain the realloc function in C. Realloc, it means reallocation. We can resize previously allocated memory. The realloc function, it takes two arguments, a pointer to smold memory and a new size in bytes. If you're familiar with other programming languages, the memory we allocate behaves very similarly to a dynamic array. Now, this topic is probably going to be one of the most complicated in this series. We'll take it step by step at a time. To work with the Realic function, we need to include the following header file. Include standard library.h. In this scenario, let's say that we're a store owner. We need to dynamically allocate some space for some prices, some floatingoint numbers. So, we're going to start with the Malo function and then reallocate it later. Let's say we have an integer of number. What is the number of prices that we need for our store? If we have five products, number is going to be five. Let's initialize this to be zero right away. And then we will ask for the total number. Enter the number of prices colon space. Then we will accept some user input. scan f. We're accepting an integer percent d. Store this at the address of our number variable. Now, we're going to dynamically allocate some space, but we're not going to use the realic function right away. What are we storing within our dynamic memory? Well, we're storing prices. An appropriate data type would be a floatingoint number. We're going to be returned with a pointer. a pointer to some dynamic memory. Let's name this prices. It behaves like an array if we access it. Now, we're going to use the Malo function or you can use calick too to clear it. Either one. We need to pass in a size in bytes of the memory we would like to allocate. But we're going to calculate that. Take our number for the number of elements times the size of function. Well, what are we storing? We're storing floatingoint numbers. With this formula, we can calculate the size we need and reserve that amount of memory in bytes. If we're dynamically allocating some memory, we'll want to be sure to free it when we're done with it. It's like renting an apartment. We have to return the apartment when we're done with it. To do so, we'll call the free function. Pass in our pointer to free it. And then we will take our pointer, set it equal to be null. I like to think of a pointer as a key. Once we're done with the apartment, we have to return the key to the key to the apartment. Now, as good practice, if for some reason we can't allocate some memory, we will be returned with a value of null. We'll check for that. If prices equals null, we don't want to continue because if you dreference a null pointer, it can cause a segmentation fault. So, let's print the following. print f we'll say memory allocation failed new line and then let's return an exit code of one to exit the program let's be sure that everything is running fine just as a test enter the number of prices I'll just say five okay no problems now let's enter some prices in we'll use a for loop for int i equals zero. We'll continue while i is less than the number of elements we have. Then increment i by one. During each cycle, we'll create a prompt. Let me scroll down. We'll say enter price number. We're going to insert an integer. I'll add a colon, then a space. We'll insert whatever i is, but I'll add an offset of one. because I is going to start at zero and price number zero might not make sense to a user. Then we'll need some user input scan f. We're accepting a floatingoint number. The format specifier is percent f. Then we're storing this at the address of our pointer of prices at index of i. We can treat this pointer like it's an array. That is acceptable. Then let's display our prices. I'll copy this for loop, paste it, and we're just going to display the prices using print f. If we're displaying prices, I'll add a dollar sign or pick a different unit of currency. We're displaying a floatingoint number, percent f. I'll display two digits after the decimal. I'll add 2 and then separate each with a space. We are displaying prices at index of i. All right. And this should work. We want to be sure that this base program is running. Enter the number of prices. Let's say we have five prices. Enter price number one. I'll just make something up. $1.99. Price 2 will be $2.99. And I'll just go through all five. Then lastly, we have $5.99. All right, here are my prices. We have 199 through 599. Now, here's where realic comes in. Once we have our dynamic memory, what if we would like to add more prices or get rid of some? Here's how. At which point would we like to use the realic function? Let's say after we've already typed in some prices. We're going to ask if we would like to change the number of prices we have. So, let's create a variable. Let's say int new number. I'll set that to be zero right away. We're going to have a new number of elements. So, let's create a prompt. Print f enter a new number of prices colon space. We'll use scanf. We're accepting an integer. Store this at the address of our new number variable. Now it's time to use realic. What's the data type of the memory we're storing? We're storing floatingoint numbers. One common convention for realic is to create a pointer named temp. Temp meaning temporary. We're only going to be using this pointer temporarily. Equals realloc function. We have to pass in a pointer and a new size. We have to pass in a pointer to the old memory and a new size in bytes. So let's take our pointer of prices. The realic function is going to copy the prices over to some new memory. Then we need a new size. Rather than just hard- coding a number here, we're going to calculate it. take the new number of elements we have times the size of a floatingoint number. The realic function will return a pointer to some new memory and copy the previous values over from our old memory of prices. Now in case this fails, this will return a value of null. Let's check for that. We'll use an if statement. If temp equals null then we will print using print f we'll say could not reallocate memory new line. Now you could return an exit code of one to exit. I don't want us to lose the previous memory. We don't actually need to return one if we don't want to exit. Before displaying all the prices, let's add an else statement. We're going to take our pointer of prices and copy the address over from temp. Prices equals temp. If a pointer is a key, we're basically copying the key. Our pointer of prices now points at this new memory rather than the old memory. Now, what you could do, although it's optional, if you plan on reusing this variable of temp, I would recommend setting temp to equal null, but that's not necessary in this case. Now, we have to enter in some more prices. So, what we can do is copy this for loop and paste it within the else statement. We're going to begin where we left off. We'll set I equal to the original number but continue while I is less than the new number. Let's say the original number of elements was five and now we would like 10 elements. I will start at five then and we'll continue till 10. We're continuing where we left off in the old memory. Once we enter all the new prices, let's display them. Really, we can just cut this loop where we display the elements. and paste them within the else statement. But we'll continue this for loop while I is less than the new number of elements. And that should be everything. Let's test it. Enter the number of prices. Let's say we have five prices. I'll just make up some numbers. 199 29. And I'll just go through the list. Here's where the realic function is going to kick in. We're going to change the size of the memory we've allocated. Let's say now we would like 10 prices. Well, now we can enter price six in. And we'll finish with $10.99. And here's all the prices. We have 10 elements. Each holds a floatingoint number. We have 199 through 1099. What if the new size of the array is less? Let's test it. Enter the number of prices. I'll say five. Again, I'll make up some numbers. Let's say I would like to change the size of the memory to be three. we have two less products in our store. Enter a new number of prices. I'll say three. What we end up doing is copying these three values to some new dynamic memory. And then we're only displaying three this time. So with real, we can take some memory and resize it. We can make it bigger or we can make it smaller. All right, everybody. That's the real function. It means reallocation. We can resize previously allocated memory. We have to pass in a pointer to some old memory and a new size in bytes. And well everybody that is the realic function in C."
eIlcl-mt3tg,Read files using C programming in 6 minutes! 📖,2025-04-12T14:00:59Z,"Hello everybody. In this video, I'm going to show you how we can read a file using C. To read a file, we'll need a file to work with. Within our project folder, let's create a new file. I'll name this file input.txt. Then think of something to write. I'll write a poem. Here's my poem. Roses are red, violets are blue, booty booty booty rocking everywhere. Let's be sure to save it. You can use Ctrl S to save it automatically. Now, we're going to read this file. Here's how. We'll define a pointer to where this file is located. This is a strruct. The data type is file all caps. Then let's think of a pointer name. Use the dreference operator. We'll say lowercase P then the word file. Now this is going to equal we'll call the f open function. We have to pass in a file path and a mode. The file path can be a relative file path or an absolute file path. We'll stick with the relative file path at least in the beginning just because this file is within the same project folder. Here you'll list the name of the file. The name of my file is input.txt. Be sure to get the extension too. Then we need a mode. We'll use R for read. Whereas in the last video, we use W for write. We need R this time. Now when we open a resource, such as opening a file, I recommend we write the code to close it right away, just so we don't forget to do it later. When we open a file, when we're done with it, we'll call f close to close it. We will close the pointer to the file. The reason that we're closing this file is because you don't want to leave any resources open when your program is finished. Now, in case for some reason we can't open this file or locate it, this function will return a value of null and we can use that if the pointer to our file is null. Then we'll print could not open file. We'll use print f could not open file. At the end of this if statement, we'll return an exit code of one. We're telling the C compiler that there was an error. If you reach the end of the program and you return zero, that means there were no errors. If you return one, that means there was an error. And let's test this. Let's say I get the file extension wrong. Instead of txt, this will be txp. Well, we get this error message that we wrote could not open file. But if we could locate this file input.txt, well, then we don't get that error message, which is good. Now, another thing that we'll need is a buffer. A buffer is like a waiting room and it temporarily stores data for us to read. In this case, we'll create a character array of buffer, but we do need to specify a size. The size will be in bytes. A good general purpose size is 1,024 bytes, 1 kilob. And then just to clear it, I'm going to initialize it to zero. Just in case we accidentally read it before assigning it, we won't get unexpected behavior. Now, the reason that we need a buffer, it's going to temporarily store data. For a real life example, if we didn't have a buffer, that'd be like us reading a book one word at a time, then going across the room to write down that word. If we have a buffer, it would be as if we're reading a whole paragraph from a book, then going across the room to write that paragraph down. It'll make your program more efficient. But if your buffer is too big, you'll be using a lot of wasted memory. 1,024 bytes is a good general purpose size, but you can adjust this depending on what you're reading. All right. Now, here's how we can read the text from a file. One technique is to use a while loop. Within the condition of the while loop, we'll use the fgets function. Once we run out of text, fgets will return a value of null. And we can check for that while the value returned by fgets does not equal null. But there's a few things we need to pass into the fgets function. We need our buffer. That's where we'll be storing the text from the file. Then the size of the buffer, which is 1,024 bytes. But rather than manually coding a number here, I recommend using the size of function. Return the size of our buffer just in case we decide to change it later. We don't have to manually do it here, too. This will adjust it automatically. Then we need a pointer to our file. All right. Now during each cycle of this while loop, we'll print whatever is within our buffer. Print f. We're displaying a string. We will display what's within our buffer. And that's it. Let's run this. Here's my poem. Roses are red. Violets are blue. Booty booty booty. Rocking everywhere. Let's say that this file is someplace else, maybe on your desktop. Well, we can use an absolute file path. Here's how. Let's take our file. Let's pretend this wasn't here. Let's take our file and move it to our desktop. Then we just need the file path. You can rightclick it, go to properties, then copy this location. And we can delete this. With F open, we're going to paste that file path preceding the file name. You'll likely need to use double backslashes. All right. And we should be able to read that file, too. Roses are red, violets are blue. Booty booty booty. Rocking everywhere. All right, everybody. That is how to read a file using C."
Jx12Vf0VxmY,The ternary operator is easy! ❓,2025-04-04T15:23:20Z,"Yo, what's going on everybody? In this video, I got to explain the turnary operator using C. The turnary operator, it's represented by a question mark. It's shorthand for using if else statements. Basically, you write a condition, then add the turnary operator, a question mark. It's kind of like you're asking a question. Is this condition true? If it is true, return some value. Otherwise, return some other value. I think the best way for me to explain this is to just give you a bunch of different examples. Here's the first example. We'll have two integers. int x will equal some number five. That's the first thing that came to mind. Int= 6. I'm also going to create a variable of max. Max will store the greater of these two numbers either five or six. Well, we can do that with the trinary operator, but first we need a condition. Now, you don't necessarily need a set of parenthesis to wrap your condition, but it does help with readability. The condition will be, is x greater than y? That's the turnary operator. It's as if we're asking a question. Is this true? If it is true, we can return some value. Some value if it is true. If that condition is true, we'll return x colon. Think of it like otherwise. Return y. And then let's output the max variable and see what it contains. We're displaying an integer percent d. We will display max. Max has a value of six. That's the greater of these two numbers. If y were seven though, well then max is seven. You follow this formula. Condition question mark some value. if that condition is true or some value if that condition is false. Here's another example. We'll need to work with booleans this time. Include the following header file standard bool.h. We'll create a boolean variable of is online. I'll set that to be true. We're going to print the following. We're displaying a string. Our condition is going to be is online. Since it's a boolean, we can just list it here. It is already true or false. Question mark the turnary operator. Is this true? We're asking a question. If it is true, we'll return a string of online. Otherwise, we'll return a string of offline. Are we online? Currently, that's true. So, we output online. If this were false, then we'll output offline. Here's another example. We'll determine if a number is even or odd. We'll need a number int number equals I'll say 8. Using the turnary operator, we'll output if this number is even or odd. We'll use print f. We're displaying two values this time. Our number, it's an integer. the word is then a string. Here we'll insert our number. Then we'll use the trinary operator. This will be our condition. Is our number divisible by two? Number modulus 2. The modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division. If a number divides by two evenly, the remainder is zero. Is this equal to zero? Then the turnary operator, we're asking a question. If number divides by two evenly, we'll output even. Colon will output odd if it's false. Number is currently eight. 8 is even. If this were an odd number like 9, well then 9 is odd. Here's another example. We'll create a variable of age. Set it equal to some age. We'll use a condition to check to see if somebody is 18 or older. We'll use print f. We'll display a string. Then we need a condition. Is our age greater than 18? Question mark. Is that true? If it is, return a string of adult. Otherwise, return a string of child. Currently, my age is 21. That will output adult. If this were 12, this would output child. All right, last example. The last example involves time. We'll display A.M. or P.M. if the hours is 12 or greater. We'll need a few things. Int hours. This will be in military time. I'll set hours to be 11 and int minutes. I'll set minutes to be 30. We'll print the time. We're displaying an integer for the hours, an integer for the minutes, and then a string for the meridium. The meridium is either A.M. or P.M. We have to insert three values. We have hours, minutes, then the meridium. But here we'll use the turnary operator. We start with a condition. The condition will be is hours less than 12. Turnary operator. If that's true, we're going to output A.M. Otherwise, output P.M. because after 12 hours, it's P.M. All right, let's see what we have currently. We do have to do a little bit of formatting though. Hours is 11, minutes is 30, our meridium is A.M. I'm going to add some zero padding. Let's say that minutes is just three, 3 minutes after 11. We would like to add some zero padding with these format specifiers. I'll add two zeros for padding. 02 following the percent sign. And that's better. Then we just have to add a colon here between the hours and the minutes. Replace that space with a colon. That's a lot better. Now, let's set ours to be 12. It's 12:30. Well, the time will output 12:30 p.m. Hey, this is Bro from the future. I haven't talked about pointers yet in this series, but what you could do is create a pointer that points to the first character in the strings of AM or PM, then display it. Here's how. We'll create a pointer. The data type will be char. Use an asterisk for a pointer. We'll name this pointer meridium. Equals. We'll cut our formula for the turnary operator and paste it. Our meridium is either going to point to the string of am or pm. Then we will display our meridium. And there we go. I think that's a lot more readable, too. All right, everybody. That is the trinary operator. It's shorthand for using if else statements. You have a condition, then you use the trinary operator like you're asking a question. Is it true? If so, return some value. If not, return some other value. It's a pretty useful shortcut. And well, everybody, that is the turnary operator in C."
y4siEcxgOpM,Initialize an array with user input in C ➡️,2025-03-28T15:05:21Z,"Yo, what's going on people? In this video, I'm going to show you how we can enter user input into an array. Normally, when you create an array, you list the data type followed by the array name, such as scores. We'll create some test scores. Add a set of straight brackets equals. Then, within curly braces, you can add some values. For example, I'll just add 100, 90, 80, 70, and 60. That's good enough for now. What if we would like to fill these values in? we would need an empty array such as this. However, when declaring an array, you do need to set the size, meaning the number of elements that you want. If I'm going to insert five values into this array, I need five elements. You can set the size of an uninitialized array by adding a number between the set of square brackets. Our array contains five elements, which we're going to fill in later. But there's one thing I want to show you. Using a for loop, I'm going to display the elements. We'll need a counter int i. I'll set that equal to zero. I'll continue while i is less than the size of our array. I'll just put five here, but you could calculate the size using the size of function. Then increment i by one during each cycle. I'm going to print each element in this loop. We're going to display an integer. Separate each with a space. I'll add a space then print my array of scores at index of i. I've declared an array but have not initialized it. I haven't assigned any values. Here's what's in it currently when I run it. Well, I get some garbage values in my array. I have 8 0 36 0 and then 1.9 billion or something. These values were left over from a previous program. If I access and use an array and not assign it any values, it's going to already be filled with garbage, which would lead to unexpected behavior in my program. What I would recommend is that when we declare a fixed size array, we set all the elements to zero by setting them equal to then within curly braces zero to clear them out. Now, if I were to run this program, all the elements of my array are zero, which is a lot better than those garbage values. Now, when you partially initialize an array, any unspecified elements are automatically set to zero as well. Setting one of the elements to zero would be the same thing as me typing in a bunch of zeros. Five zeros if there's five elements in this array, but you don't need to do that. C will implicitly do that. We have an array of five values and we've cleared out all the previous values just to avoid any unexpected behavior. Now we need to get some user input. Later on we'll be using a loop. I'll show you how we can add elements one by one. Let's start with a prompt. Let's say print f enter a score colon space. Then I'll use scan f. We're accepting an integer. We need a format specifier of percent d. Then store this at the address of my array of scores at index. Then pick an index. We'll start with zero. Let's give it a test run. Enter a score. I'll say 90. Here's my array. Currently, we have 90 0 0 0. We've entered an element at the index of zero. the first element. Let's do this with the others. But don't worry, we'll use a loop later to make it more simple. We're going to enter in five elements. Scores at index zero. Scores at index 1 2 3 4. Let's run this again. Enter a score. I'll say 90 80 70 60 then 50. And here's my array. We have the scores of 90, 80, 70, 60, 50. Now, we are repeating ourselves a lot. We can use a loop instead. We need a loop to cycle five times cuz there's five elements in this array. Let's use a for loop. Int i equals z continue while i is less than the size of our array. Five. Again, you could use the size of function to automatically calculate that, but that might be overkill for this lesson. I'm trying to keep it simple. We'll continue while I is less than five. Cut our prompt and scan F. Paste it within the for loop, but change the index to be I to reflect the current cycle of the loop. I is going to change during each cycle. It'll start at zero and stop at four. This will do the same thing and it's a lot less code to write. Enter a score. 90 80 70 60 50. And here's my array of numbers. We have 90 80 70 60 50. That's how to enter data into an array. When you use scanf, use the address of operator. List your array. But then you need an index number. All right, everybody. That's how to enter values into an array in C."
6Hk2aE_SRzY,Arrays in C are easy! 🗃️,2025-03-27T15:15:57Z,"So yeah, today I got to talk about arrays in the C programming language. An array is a fixedsized collection of elements of the same data type. Think of it this way. An array is similar to a variable, but it can hold more than one value. It's a little more complex than that, but that's a good way of thinking of it. Here's a demonstration. I'll create an int of number. Set it equal to some number. This is a variable. Well, I could convert this to be an array. After the name of the variable, add a set of straight brackets and close any values with the set of curly braces. Then you can add more than one value, but they have to be commaepparated. I'll add 20, 30, 40, 50. The name of your array should be descriptive of what it contains. Instead of number singular, I'll say numbers plural. That makes more sense because we have a couple numbers in here rather than just one. Now, if I were to print my numbers directly using print f, for example, I'll display an integer and I will display my array of numbers. Here's my result. I get some really long funky number. Normally, if you pass an array to a function, including print f, it decays into something called a pointer. But that's a future lesson. We'll run into unexpected behavior. Rather than printing the name of the array, we're going to print the elements within this array. Each value in an array is an element. To display my array at the first index, take the name of your array, add a set of straight brackets, then list an index number. For the first element in an array, you actually use zero because computers like to start with zero. If I were to print this, this would display 10 numbers at index zero, that's 10. Index one is 20, 2 is 30, 3 is 40, 4 is 50. If I attempt to access an element that doesn't exist, well, we're out of bounds technically. You'll get some sort of garbage value. And in my example, I got 624. In C programming, you can go out of bounds when working with arrays. In most other programming languages, you'll encounter an error. Usually, some sort of index out of bounds exception, but we don't have that luxury in C. Be sure that when accessing elements, you don't go out of bounds. In my array, I have five indices 0 through 4. Let's create a few more arrays. It'd be good practice for us. Let's create an array of characters named grades. These are letter grades. Let's start with a single variable just a character of a. I'll convert this variable to be an array. After the name, add a set of straight brackets. Enclose all values within a set of curly braces. Comma separate each value A, B, C, D, and F. Let's change grade to be grades cuz that's more descriptive. Rather than displaying an integer, let's display a character percent C for the format specifier. Let's display grades at index zero. That's going to be an A. Index one is B, two is C, three is D, four is F. An array of characters is very similar to strings in C. When we've created strings, we would declare an array of characters such as name equals. Then within double quotes, we list a bunch of characters. These are both arrays of characters. If I were to display name at index of zero, it should give me a capital B, which it does. Index one is R. Two is O. After creating an array, you can change the values, but you have to access an index number, which is what we did here. Let's display numbers at index zero. We're displaying an integer. We'll access our array of numbers at index zero, then change it to be 100. Set it equal to 100. That should give me 100. Let's do this with the others. I'll do a lot of copying and pasting. Index one will be 90, two will be 80, 3 is 70, 4 will be 60. Then let's display all these. I'll add some new lines numbers at index zero. Then 1 2 3 4. And here are my numbers. I have 100 190 80 70 60. If you do need to display all the elements of an array, you could use a loop. Here's a demonstration. Let's say I would like to display my grades. I have five grades within here. I need a for loop to cycle five times. four int i. Set that equal to zero. Continue as long as i is less than five. Increment i by one after each cycle. During each cycle, I'm going to print the following. We're displaying a character this time. I'll add a new line, then display my array of grades. Rather than putting a number here, such as 0, 1, or two, we're going to use I after each cycle of this loop is complete, we're incrementing I by one. It'll start at zero and stop at four cuz that's what we set the condition to be. Here's the output. I get the letters A, B, C, D, F. Rather than using a new line, let's use a space to separate each each element. A B C D F Let's display numbers. Numbers at index of I during each cycle. Oh, but we have to display an integer, not a character. There we go. 10 20 30 40 50. Let's display our name. And then we are displaying a character. Well, my name gets cut off because we're only looping five times. For this for loop, I have to manually change the condition. In my name, I have let's see how many characters. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 I would have to manually change this for loop. And that's a lot of work. But we display all the letters of my name. Let's go back to numbers. Let's say that I set the condition to be I is less than 5 and we're displaying an integer. What if I add a new number such as 60? Well, we're only cycling five times. If I need to display the full length of the array, I would manually have to change this condition to be six cuz there's six elements. We have 10 through 60. Wouldn't it be nice if we can calculate automatically what the size is going to be, the size of the array? Well, there's one way in which we can do that. Here's a trick. Just for the time being, I'm going to comment out this for loop. We can use the size of function to get the size of something. Whatever we pass in, I'm going to print the following two things. We're going to display an integer. I will display call the size of function. Pass in my array of numbers. The size of function will give you the size of something in bytes. My array of numbers, it takes 24 bytes. 24 bytes of memory. Now let's get the size of one of the elements. Print f percent d because we're displaying an integer. get the size of one of the elements numbers at index zero. The reason that I'm choosing zero rather than one or some other number is because what if our array only has one element? Numbers at index one would be out of bounds. So people go with zero. Then let's add some new lines. The size of my array is 24 bytes. The size of one of the elements is four bytes. If we divided the size of the array by one of the elements, that's going to give us six six elements. If I were to add another element, the size of my array should change, but the size of one of the elements is going to stay the same. Now, my array is 28 bytes. The size of one of the elements is still four bytes. Let's change that back. Why don't we divide the size of the array by the size of one of the elements? That's going to calculate the number of elements in my array. We'll declare a variable. Let's name it size equals call the size of function. Return the size of my array numbers divided by the size of one of the elements numbers at element zero. In my example, size should be six. Then with our for loop, let's bring that back in. size will be six. We'll continue as long as I is less than the size, the size of our array, the number of elements that is. And we should get the numbers 10 through 60. Let's add a few more just to be sure that it's working. Let's add 70. Yep, we have 70. Then 80. And we have 80. If you would like to condense some of this code, you could copy this section where we divide the size of the array by the size of one of the elements. We'll cut that. Delete this line. Then we'll continue while I is less than whatever number is returned from this equation. The code is more condensed, but it's less readable, especially for a beginner. Use whatever technique you would prefer. All right, everybody. Those are arrays. They're a fixed-sized collection of elements of the same data type. They're similar to variables, but they can hold more than one value. It's nice if you need a collection of something. And well, everybody, those are arrays in C."
Z5smVeUVNFU,Let&#39;s code a BANK PROGRAM with C programming! 💵,2025-03-24T13:43:27Z,"hey everybody in this video we're going to create a banking program in C a user can check their balance deposit money withdraw money and exit the program this video is meant to serve as a practice project for beginners let's get started all right let's get started everybody now we have a few functions to create we'll start by declaring some function prototypes with our banking program we need to check a balance the return type will be void the function name will be check balance but we have to pass in a balance this will be a floating Point number for a parameter we list the data type followed by the name of the parameter balance we'll need a function to make a deposit float deposit there will be no parameters and a withdraw function we'll be returning a float the name of the function will be withdraw there will be one parameter a floating Point number of balance because if we're withdrawing money we need to know what our balance is because we don't want to withdraw more than our balance okay these are the three functions we'll need let's copy these function prototypes after the main function we'll paste them add a set of parentheses we'll finish defining them later we do have to return something for deposit and withdraw for the time being just so our program runs successfully I'm going to return 0.0f a floating Point number we'll do this for withdraw to we'll get back to these functions later but we can at least use them we'll declare the variables we'll need now that we have our functions at least declared let me zoom in a little we're going to create an integer of choice set that equal to zero based on a user's Choice 1 through 4 they can check their balance deposit money withdraw money or exit we're going to need a floating point number of balance this will represent how much money they have in their bank account we'll set this to be zero right away 0.0f because it's a floating Point number then when we start up this program let's create a welcome message of some sort we'll use printf I'll display the following welcome to the bank or maybe this is an ATM or something we're going to continue this program while Choice does not equal 4 ideally a user is going to select a choice 1 through four we'll use a do while loop do this code once while our choice this Choice does not equal four if user types in four that means they want to exit the program within the do while loop we'll create a menu we'll need a few printf statements printf I'll add a new line character to begin with we will ask a user to select an option then I'll add another new line character this will be for option one I'll add a new line character option one will be to check balance new line option two will be to make a deposit option two deposit money three will be to withdraw money three withdraw money and four is to exit for exit let's create a prompt to enter your choice new line and enter your choice then colon space we'll need to use scanf to get some user input we're accepting an integer at the address of our variable choice we will insert a value there let's do a test run this program should continue as long as our choice does not equal four welcome to the bank select an option want is to check your balance two is to deposit money three is to withdraw money and four is to exit let's start with one we continue the loop that's good 2 3 five if I press four we should exit four and we exit the program which is good because we need some way to get out of this Loop while Choice does not equal four continue the loop now we'll need a switch using a switch will'll examine our choice against any matching cases with in the loop we'll create a switch we're examining our choice variable if our choice matches a case of one that means the user wants to check their balance we'll call the check balance function but we do have one parameter set up we have to pass in our balance whatever it currently is initially at zero when we start the program we will pass in our balance then be sure to break to break out of the switch now if Case is two if our choice is two that means we want to make a deposit we will call the deposit function there's no parameters we don't have to pass in anything we will make a deposit now the deposit function does return a floating Point number so what we could say is our balance equals our balance plus our deposit because we're returning a number if our balance is zero and we're adding let's say $100 our balance after making the deposit should be 100 let's shorten this to plus equals our deposit then let's break break case three is to withdraw money we will take our balance equals our balance minus called the withdrawal function but we do have to pass in our balance withdraw pass in our balance and again we can shorten this code by saying balance minus equals the withdrawal function and that's a shortcut you can use again we still have to fill in these functions then break case 4 is to exit case 4 what just print something a goodbye message I'll add a new line Thank you for using the bank and then break now let's add a default case if somebody types in something besides 1 through four We'll add a default case and we'll say I'll add a new line invalid Choice please select let me zoom out a little bit 1 through 4 new line all right let's do another test run welcome to the bank I will check my balance it doesn't do anything currently though two to deposit three to withdraw I'll type in five that's not a valid Choice invalid Choice please select 1 through four and then four to exit thank you for using the bank all right the main body of our code is done now we just have to fill in the various functions we'll start with check balance all the way down here this one's pretty simple we'll just write a print statement we'll print a new line we'll say your current balance is colon space pick unit of currency I'll pick American dollars we're displaying a floating Point number we need percent F I'm going to display two digits after the decimal so then we're displaying dollars and cents two digits after the decimal new line then our balance whatever it is we'll receive this as an argument because we have this parameter setup let's do a test run currently I will check my balance and it should be zero your current balance is 0 and 0 now we'll make a deposit we'll fill in the deposit function we will create a floating Point number of amount what's the amount we would like to deposit initially I'll set this to be 0.0f we need a prompt where we will ask you user to make a deposit how much do they want to deposit new Line enter amount to deposit go in space I'll add a dollar sign then scanf to get some input we're going to accept a floating Point number the format specifier is percent F at the address of our amount variable now if somebody tries to deposit negative money we can check that with an if statement if our amount is less than zero we'll just print the following message invalid amount new line we do have to return something we're just going to return zero we'll just print invalid amount we're going to add zero to our balance else the amount is valid and we can print something like this print F successfully deposited pick unit of currency percent f for a floating Point number display two digits after the decimal new line display our amount whatever we're depositing then we will return our amount rather than 0.0f we're going to add this amount to our balance return amount Let's test these two functions check balance and deposit let's check our balance with one currently at zero I'll make a deposit enter amount to deposit $100 And1 successfully deposited $100 And1 C I'll check my balance again and I have $100 And1 let's try and deposit money to to deposit I'll deposit 42069 let's say invalid amount check my balance again and we still have $100 And1 then we just have to withdraw money that's the last function to fill in within the withdraw function we will create a local variable a floating Point number of amount and I will set this to be 0.0f right away we'll ask the user how much they want to withdraw we'll add a new Line enter amount to withdraw and I'll add a dollar sign scan F to get some user input we're accepting a floating Point Number store this at the address of our amount variable now if our amount is negative we can't withdraw negative of money if amount is less than zero we will print invalid amount new line then return 0.0f so we don't withdraw anything now else if our amount is greater than our balance well we can't withdraw money that we don't have not normally at least if our amount is greater than our balance then we will print insufficient funds then display the balance your balance is dollar sign percent F and display two digits after the decimal new line character then display our balance return 0.0f we'll add an else statement if these two conditions are true we should have a valid amount then if that's the case we'll print the following successfully with Drew dollar sign percent F and we're displaying two digits after the decimal new line we are displaying the amount then we will return our amount and deduct it from our balance all right and that should be everything let's run this welcome to the bank select an option I will select five which is invalid invalid Choice please select 1 through 4 I will check my balance $0.0 I'll make a deposit I'll try and deposit negative money $20 invalid amount deposit money again I'll deposit $11,000 successfully deposited $1,000 I'll check my balance again my balance is $1,000 I'll withdraw money enter amount to withdraw I'll try and withdraw negative money $420 invalid amount let's try and withdraw again I'll try and withdraw money I don't have like1 kajillion dollar insufficient funds your balance is $1,000 let's withdraw something that we do have I'll just withdraw one penny 0.01 successfully withdrew one penny let's check our balance again and I have $999.99 and then I will exit for to exit thank you for using the bank all right everybody that is a banking program that you can write as an exercise if didn't see"
zdAggA1q0eo,Learn C for loops in 6 minutes! 🔂,2025-03-19T17:02:38Z,"Yo, what's going on people? So, today we got to discuss for loops in C. A for loop, it's really similar to a while loop. One of the differences is that you tend to use a for loop if you want to repeat some code a limited number of times. If you need to possibly perform some code forever, a while loop would be better, but there's a lot of overlap where you could use one or the other. Creating a for loop, there's three optional steps. Initialization, a condition, and then update. Each is separated with a semicolon. Let's say we would like to count to 10. Here's how to create a for loop. You type four parenthesis curly braces. Within the parenthesis, we have our optional steps. The first step is initialization. We can create some sort of counter. A common programming convention for your counter is to create an integer of I. I in this case means iteration, but really anything will work such as X, but you tend to see I. We'll set that equal to some number. We'll set it to zero. We'll start counting from zero. Each of these steps should be separated with a semicolon. The next step is a condition. When do we want to stop? We'll stop as long as I is less than 10. If I becomes equal to or greater than 10, we'll exit the for loop. This is our stopping condition. For the next step, we need a semicolon. Then we can update our counter. our counter of i. We'll say i ++. During each iteration of our loop, we'll increment i by one after each cycle. Just to test this, let's print the following using print f. We're going to display an integer. We need a format specifier of d. I'll add a new line character. Then we will display our counter of i. We should print the numbers 0 through 9. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. If you want to count to 10 starting at 1, you could change i to be 1 and then the condition will be i is less than or equal to 10. Then we'll start at 1 and then count to 10. Or if we want to count to 100, we can set our condition to be I is less than or equal to 100 and we count all the way to 100 starting at one. You can even count by twos or some other number. Instead of incrementing I by one, we're going to increment by two by setting the update step to be I +als 2. Then we should count by twos starting at 1. 1 3 5 7 9. Or if we were to start at 2, where i equals 2, we start at 2 and then count by twos all the way until 10. Or what if we counted by threes? I += 3. We start at 2, counting up by 3, 5, 8. What if we would like to count down? Let's start at 10 and count down to zero. We'll set i equal to 10. We'll continue as long as I is greater than or equal to zero. Then I minus minus to decrement. We start at 10, count all the way down to zero. If we would like to count down by twos, we could say I minus equals 2. Start at 10. And we're counting down by two all the way to zero or even three or some other number. 10 74 1. All right. Now, here's a mini project. We're going to count down from 10. We'll start at 10, countdown to zero, and then print happy new year. Like it's a countdown to a new year on New Year's Eve. We'll print happy new year. When we escape the for loop, we'll start at 10, countdown to zero, and decrement by 1. I - then we have 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0. Happy New Year. We can have our program sleep for approximately 1 second between each cycle of the for loop. Here's how. We'll need to include the following header file. Include. Now, if you're using Windows, include this header file, windows.h. This header file includes a sleep function meant for Windows. If you're on Linux or Mac, you'll need to include the following. Include uni std.h. This file is for Windows and this one is for Linux/MAC. All right. Before displaying a number, we're going to call the sleep function. If you're on Windows, type sleep with a capital S. Then pass in 1,00 milliseconds. If you're on Linux or Mac, sleep is going to be lowercase. And you pass in seconds rather than milliseconds. I'm running Windows. I'm going to pass in 1,000 milliseconds to the sleep function, which starts with a capital S. And now this should work. Between each cycle, our program is going to sleep for approximately 1,000 milliseconds. Here we are. We have 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 zero. Happy New Year. All right, everybody. That's a for loop. You repeat some code a limited amount of times. There's a lot of overlap where you could use a for loop or a while loop. For loops tend to be better to do something a certain or limited amount of times. And well everybody those are four loops in C."
NEj2H7SoTzQ,Learn function prototypes in 5 minutes! 📌,2025-03-17T17:59:11Z,hey what's going on everybody in this video I got to explain function prototypes in C a function prototype is a statement that you list before the main function a function prototype provides information about a function's name its return type and its parameters it has a few benefits it enables type checking allows functions to be used before they're defined improves readability organization and helps prevent errors it is considered good practice to use function prototypes here's one of the benefits we'll create a hello function void hello will accept a character array for the name and an integer for the age all we'll do is print the following using print F print F hello add a format specifier new line character then display our name parameter then our age print F you are at a format specifier we need a format specifier of D years old new line character then a parameter of age so this does work let me call this function call the hello function pass in a name and an age I'll just pass in SpongeBob because that's the first thing that came to mind SpongeBob will be 30 hello SpongeBob you're 30 years old one issue with functions in C is that imagine this is a very large program and we have hundreds of functions with C programs we read them from the top down before we use a function we have to Define it it would be nice if our main function was at the top because it drives our program let's cut the hello function and paste it after the main function and we'll see what happens exactly well we get an error our C compiler doesn't know what the hello function is we're trying to use the hello function before we've defined what it does exactly this code is a lot more organized though we have all of our functions after the main function one way in which we can use the hello function and then Define it later is to use a function prototype before the main function really all you got to do with your function is copy the return type the name and its parameters add a semicolon and this is a function prototype we're telling the compiler about the name the return type and the parameters of this function which we Define later so this should work too hello SpongeBob you are 30 years old let's create another function we'll do this after the hello function this function is going to return a Boolean if you're working with booleans be sure to include this following header file bu age check we'll check to see if somebody's old enough to work at the Crusty Crab where SpongeBob works if age check we're going to pass in an age int age if our age is greater than or equal to 16 will return true else will return false return false if you're more experienced with programming you could just condense this code to The Following return age is greater than or equal to 16 this would return a Boolean true or false so that's a little shortcut that you can do it'll do the same thing though then we need a function prototype we're going to copy the return type the name and the parameters here's our function prototype for AG check and now we can use it I'll use an if statement if call our function of AG check pass in an age we'll say 30 if that function returns true we'll print the following you are old enough to work at the Crusty Crab else we're going to print print F you must be 16 plus to work at the Crusty Crab okay let's try it our age is set to 30 hello SpongeBob you are 30 years old you are old enough to work at the Crusty Crab if I I were 14 well then you must be 16 plus to work at the Crusty Crab I already everybody those are function prototypes they provide the compiler with information about a function's name return type and its parameters before you actually Define what they do exactly it improves your code's readability organization and helps prevent errors it is considered good practice to use function prototypes we'll be using these in the future going forward and well everybody those are function prototypes in C
NtlSzRWhaOc,Switches in C are easy! 💡,2025-03-06T23:41:10Z,hey everybody in this video we're going to cover switches in C a switch is an alternative to using many if and else if statements it's actually more efficient when working with fixed integer values and it also helps with readability let me give you a demonstration of why switches would be useful let's take this sample program we have a day of the week it's an integer 1 through 7 if day of the week equals 1 it is Monday two is for Tuesday three is for Wednesday Wednesday so on and so forth within an L statement we have please enter a number 1 through 7 well currently my day of the week is 1 it is Monday two means Tuesday seven is for Sunday then if we have something that's not valid like zero well we print please enter a number if you use a lot of LF statements it can be inefficient and it's hard to read if you find that you're using a lot of else if statements you can use a switch as an alternative here's an example to create a switch we'll type switch parentheses curly braces within the parentheses of the switch we examine a value these are good for examining integers and characters we're going to examine our day of the week it's an integer We compare this value against any matching cases we'll create a case of one colon any code underneath this case will execute if these two values match our day of the week and this case of one if our day of the week is one we'll do something we'll print it is Monday then this is very important add break after to break out of the switch later on I'll show you what happens if we're missing it case two means Tuesday if our day of the week matches a case of two then we'll print it is Tuesday and then we will break really we just have to follow this pattern and just to save a little bit of time I'm going to do a lot of copying and pasting we have case three for Wednesday case four for Thursday case five for Friday K six for Saturday k seven for Sunday all right and that's our switch you could add a default case but we'll take take care of that in a moment let's perform a test run I'll set day of the week to be one well we print it is Monday if day of the week was two then we print it is Tuesday three is for Wednesday let's skip to seven 7 is Sunday let's temporarily remove these breakes statements and we'll see what happens exactly those break statements will break out of the switch if we're missing them then this happens I'll set the day to be Thursday that would be four it is Thursday it is Friday it is Saturday it is Sunday once we reach a matching case in this example day of the week is four we do this code but if we're missing those break statements we Cascade to the next case and do this code too until we reach a break statement or escape the switch so let's put those break statements back in they're pretty important you can add a default case too if there's no matches default colon let's do the following if there's no matching cases please only enter a number 1 through 7 I'll set day of the week to be1 well we get the default case please only enter a number 1 through 7 or maybe day of the week is 99 again please only enter a number 1 through 7 let's take this a step further let's accept user input I'll set day of the we to be zero we'll need a prompt print F enter a day of the week 1 through 7 then we need scanf to get user input we're accepting an integer we need a format specifier of percent D at the address of day of the week and now we should be able to accept user input enter day of the week I'll type in one it is Monday three it is Wednesday six it is Saturday then I'll type in something that's out of bounds it's the 69th day of the week please only enter a number 1 through 7 switches can also be used with characters let's change day of the week to be a char and I will initially set this to be a null Terminator character when we enter the day of the week we'll want to type in a character M will be for Monday t for Tuesday W for Wednesday Thursday is going to be R because we already have t for Tuesday F for Friday s for Saturday we already have an S for Saturday Sunday will be you since we're accepting a character we have to use the format specifier percent C for a character now the matching cases will be characters this time if our day of the week this character matches a case of capital M it is Monday T is for Tuesday W is for Wednesday R is for Thursday F is for Friday s is for Saturday you is for Sunday then we'll need to copy these characters for our default case please only enter a character and then we'll give them the following options all right this should work too enter a day of the week I'll type in capital M it is Monday R is for Thursday it is Thursday capital S it is Saturday and then I'll type in something that's not valid P for pizza day then we get that default case all right everybody so that's a switch it's an alternative to using many if else statements it's actually more efficient when using fixed integer values which is what we did initially these work really well with integers and characters and in many cases it's easier to read than using many IFL statements and well everybody those are switches in C
wt194lO5kKE,Let&#39;s code a mad libs game with C programming! 📖,2025-03-02T15:57:36Z,hey everybody in this video we're going to create an interactive Mad Libs game using C this topic serves as a practice project so we get used to accepting strings as user input let's get started before we begin we'll need to include the string header file because we'll be working with strings include string.h mostly we just need to remove the new line character at the end of each string when we accept user input we'll declare the different variables we'll need the only type of variable we'll be working with in this topic are arrays of characters also known as strings let's create a character array of noun in the English language a noun is a person place or thing you're also going to get an English lesson here today too then we'll specify a size we'll say 50 for maximum size of 50 characters that should be more than enough I'll set these to be empty strings right away a noun is a person place or thing then a verb a verb is an action like running I will set that to be an empty string we'll need a few adjectives an adjective describes something such as fast slow loud quiet adjective I'll just set these all to be 50 we'll need a few adjectives I'll say adjective one then two then three and I'll just copy this then we have adjective two ADC 3 these are the variables we'll need they're all arrays of characters strings a user is going to fill these in we'll need some prompts we'll use print F the first prompt we'll ask for is for an adjective an adjective describes something enter an adjective I'll add a hint here too let's say an adjective is a description let's create another prompt the next prompt will be for a noun a person place or thing enter a noun and I'll add a hint that we are looking for an animal or a person we'll need an adjective again I'll copy this print statement and just paste it then a verb a verb is an action such as running or jumping enter a verb I want the verb to end in ing so that it's present tense someone or something is currently doing something verb ending with ing and then an adjective again again an adjective is a description we're describing something now we need to accept user input since we're accepting strings including white spaces we'll use f gets because scan F doesn't accept any white spaces a user will enter in adjective one that's the first argument then we need the size of adjective one we could just say 50 but it's better to calculate it just in case we change it we don't have to manually change it here too return the size of adjective one then we need STD in for standard input we'll have to do the same thing for noun we'll do a lot of copying and pasting F gets noun give me the size of my noun variable then adjective again this will be for adjective two then verb our verb variable F gets our verb variable return the size of our verb variable and adjective three temporarily let's display our variables using print F we're displaying a string we'll need a format specifier of percent s for string then a new line we'll display noun our verb and our adjective Ives adjective 1 2 and 3 we just want to be sure that everything's working let's do a test run an adjective describe something I'll say fast enter a noun an animal or a person I'll say Sonic enter an adjective cool enter a verb ending with ing running I forgot to add a colon at a space I'll have to fix that enter an adjective funny here's our output we have Sonic running fast cool funny so there is a new line character within the input buffer we'll have to remove that but I also need to add a colon and a space after this print statement because I forgot to do that now we need to get rid of that new line character within the input buffer so to do that we'll take each variable in this case adjective one will'll start here add a set of square brackets call the string length function this will return the length of the string pass in our variable of adjective one minus one set this equal to a null Terminator character then we just have to repeat this process for the other variables we'll repl replace adjective one with noun do this with adjective two adjective two adjective two then verb verb verb then adjective three all right let's do our test run again enter an adjective fast enter a noun Sonic enter an adjective cool enter a verb ending with ing running enter an adjective funny Sonic is my noun running is my verb adjectives 1 through three are fast cool funny now we just have to work on our story we can get rid of these print statements we're going to write a story using print statements then we'll be inserting these variables at key locations feel free to write a different story if you would like but here's one that I wrote we're going to be visiting a zoo I'll start with a new line character today I went to a we're going to insert adjective one here we'll insert a string then the word Zoo New Line character we'll be inserting adjective one at this location before Zoo we're describing our zoo is it EXP expensive is it dirty is it clean with our second sentence we'll say in an exhibit I saw a here we'll insert our noun our person place or thing followed by a new line character we'll insert our noun variable here print f we'll insert our noun variable we'll reuse it percent s our person place or thing was insert an adjective and insert a verb I'll add an exclamation point and a new line within this print statement we have three variables to insert our noun adjective 2 and our verb one more sentence I was insert adjective three new line adjective three let's see our story enter an adjective I'm going to say sussy like it's suspicious enter a noun if you've been around my channel long enough you know that I like to poke fun at Mark Zuckerberg I'm going to type in Mark Zuckerberg enter an adjective sweaty enter a verb ending with ing screaming enter an adjective surprised here's my story today I went to a sussy zoo in an exhibit I saw a Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg was sweaty and screaming I was surprised all right and that's our Mad Libs game everybody do me a favor and post your story in the comments section down below cuz I would like to read them and I'm sure other people would too and well everybody that is a Mad Libs game written in C
taI7G6U29L8,Learn Java multithreading in 8 minutes! 🧶,2024-12-27T20:27:26Z,"yo we finally made it to multi-threading in Java multi-threading enables a program to run multiple threads concurrently at the same time as we've talked about in the previous lesson a thread is a set of instructions and they run independently from other threads multi-threading is useful for background tasks or other timec consuming operations in the prior lesson we've learned that there's two ways to create threads we can either extend the thread class or implement the runnable interface the second option is better in most cases because we're not limited by single inheritance here's how we can get started multi-threading we're going to create a new class file new Java class we'll call this class my runnable my runnable will implements the runnable interface if we're implementing an interface it's kind of like we're signing a contract we have to override any required methods we have to override the run method public void run whatever's within the run method this is the code that's going to perform when this thread is up and running so what would we like to do just for a beginner's example let's count to five using a for Loop we'll write a for Loop we will create an index of I I'll set that equal to be one right away we'll continue as long as I is less than or equal to 5 cuz we're counting to five then increment I by One during each cycle this four loop I would like this thread to wait for one second before printing whatever I is whatever the current count is if we're counting we will access the thread class called The Sleep Method pass in 1,000 milliseconds to sleep for a second we will need to surround this method with try and catch blocks we'll catch any interrupted exceptions but let's output the following we'll say thread was interrupted after our thread sleeps for one second let's display the current count I'll just say I just to keep it simple let's go back to our main Java file we'll need to create a runable object my runable let's say my runable equals new my runable we have to pass in this runable object to a thread object let's say thread thread equals new thread we will pass in our runable object to get this thread to start we have to call the start method of our thread thread dot start method and this should work we'll test it one 2 3 4 5 and then we exit the program another shortcut you can do too instead of creating a named renable object we can pass in an anonymous renable object to the thread Constructor so let's copy this section delete this line of code and then pass in a new runable object this will work too and it's a lot more concise now we won't have just one thread we'll have two so let's rename three as thread one copy this line of code paste it rename the second thread as thread two thread one. start and thread 2. start so now we'll have two threads running at the same time they're running concurrently so they both say 1 2 3 4 5 we have successfully multi-threaded you could differentiate these by getting their name here's an example to get each thread's name we're going to access the thread class call the current thread method and then method chain the get name method then I'll add a space plus our counter RI just so we can see each thread by its name and what it's counting exactly okay let's try this again we have thread one and and thread zero now they won't always be in the same order they're running independently thread zero that's our thread one Java's thread one is our thread two okay here's an exercise we're going to have thread one say ping and thread two say pong like we're playing a game of ping pong we'll modify the my runnable class we'll need some text a text variable we'll say private final we don't want it to change string text then we'll need a Constructor to assign it my runnable we'll have one parameter a string of text we will assign this. text equals the text we receive instead of printing our counter we'll print our text all right and that's all we need going back to our main Java file we have to pass in some text when we construct a runable object for the first thread we'll say ping for the second thread we'll say pong so here's what we have currently pong ping and then we exit the program before we start the threads let's say game start there's one more thing I want to show you game start after we start the threads let's try and say game over game over here's what happens game start game over and our two threads are still running then we finish so the problem here is that in our main thread it doesn't Wait For Thread and thread two to finish our main thread ends immediately we can have our main thread wait for these threads to finish by calling the join method of each thread our main thread will wait for these two threads to finish after these two thread start we'll use each join method thread 1. jooin and thread 2 dojin and we do have to surround these with triang catch blocks try thread 1. jooin and thread 2. jooin if our main thread is interrupted we'll output main thread was interrupted okay this should work now before we display game over we're going to wait for our two threads to finish here's what we got game start and we display pingpong and we'll do that five times and then display game over all right everybody that is an introduction to multi-threading it enables a program to run multiple threads concurrently a thread is a set of instructions that run independently multi-threading is useful for background tasks or other timeconsuming operations and well everybody that is an introduction to multi-threading in Java"
P_iOnmdww8E,Learn Java anonymous classes in 5 minutes! 🕵️‍♂️,2024-12-19T19:03:43Z,well hello again friends today I got to explain Anonymous classes in Java so what is an anonymous class it's a class that doesn't have a name meaning it cannot be reused it's when you want to add custom Behavior without having to create a new class because it can be really inconvenient to create a new class just for one object if that one object is different from the rest in one way or another they're often used for onetime uses when utilizing features such as timer task the runnable interface or callbacks these are more advanced Java topics so let me demonstrate why an anonymous class would be useful let's begin with this example where we create a dog class file new Java class we will create a class of dog let's say that in this dog class there's a single method a speak method void speak all we'll do is I'll put the following the dog goes woof and then let's create a dog object dog dog equals new dog we'll take our dog object have it used its speak method which will output the dog goes wo so what if there's a unique kind of dog it's different from the rest let's say It's Scooby-Doo Now Scooby-Doo he doesn't speak dog he speaks English if I want Scooby-Doo to say something else I'd have to override this method so one option would be to create a new new class again this is me not using Anonymous classes you'll see their usefulness in just a moment let's create a new Java class let's create a talking dog class I know it's kind of a weird example so our talking dog class will extends the dog class and then we'll override the speak method override void speak then we'll output the following Scooby Do says what's he usually say rut row or something rut row I think that's how you spell it but you get the idea going back to our main Java file I can create a talking dog object talking dog talking dog equals new talking dog that's a lot to type and then I can have my talking dog use its speak method our dog goes woof and Scooby-Doo our talking dog says rutro like uh- oh it is a lot of work to create a whole new class just for one unique object our talking dog of Scooby-Doo is the exception so rather than creating an entirely new class just for this one object just for Scooby-Doo our talking dog let's instead create an anonymous class we'll take our talking dog class and delete it instead of creating a talking dog object let's create another dog object but it's going to have some unique features that set it apart from other dogs such as the ability to speak English let's rename dog as dog one we'll create another dog named dog 2 equals new dog add aside a parenthesis now to create an anonymous class you're going to add a set of curly braces then make sure there's that semicolon at the end within the set of curly braces you can Define any unique features or override any methods dog 2 is going to be different from all other dogs with it speak method so let's override that method at override void speak and then we'll say Scooby Do says rut r dog one is going to speak and dog two the dog goes woof Scooby-Doo says rutro so instead of creating an entirely new class just for one dog Scooby-Doo we can create a normal dog and just override one of the methods using an anonymous class so those are Anonymous classes it's a class that doesn't have a name and it cannot be reused if you need to reuse a class you're better off just creating a new class it allows you to add custom Behavior without having to create a new class which is what we did with the speak method Anonymous classes are often used with timer task which we'll talk about in the next video the runnable interface and callbacks so it is an important topic that you need to know going forward at least to create an anonymous class after you construct an object add a set of curly braces within that set of curly braces you can Define new behavior and well everybody those are Anonymous classes in Java
Pg0aoSbrqOE,How to WRITE FILES with Java in 8 minutes! ✍,2024-12-12T20:20:45Z,all right everybody in this video I'm going to show you how you can write a file using Java after doing some research I've encountered four popular options the first way I'm about to show you is the most simple and is what I'll be demonstrating in this topic we'll be using a file writer object it's good for writing small or medium siiz text files there's also buffered writer this has better performance for large amounts of text print writer is best for structured data like reports or logs then there's file output stream which is is best for binary files such as images or audio files files of that nature in this topic I'm going to cover file writer just so we get the hang of the basics I might make videos on the other writers but I haven't decided yet here's how we can write a basic file using Java we'll need a file writer object file writer I'll name this file writer just writer for short equals new file writer then we need to pass in a file path or a file name let's create a file named test and include a file extension let's say it's a txt file a plain text file now you could include an absolute file path I'll show you how to do that later our plain text file a test is going to appear in our source folder reading or writing files is kind of unpredictable you could consider that dangerous code any dangerous code we want to enclose within a tri block try this dangerous code catch any exceptions that might interrupt our program with modern Java you can try and open up some resource add a set of parentheses after try we will try to open up a file writer object so file writer writer equals new file writer then we have our file name including the extension now we do have to import this class import java.io file wrer if for some reason we can't write this file we might encounter an exception we will catch any IO exceptions IO meaning input output catch any input output exceptions that's the type we will give this exception a nickname of e then we do have to import this class too in order to work with IO exceptions java. I.O exception in case there's a problem writing this file we'll catch this exception if it comes up this acts as more of a safety net if we encounter this exception we can say something generic such as could not write file but it is best practice to handle specific kind of exceptions first momentarily we're going to add a catch clause for a file not found exception in case we can't locate a file path but we'll take care of that in a moment within the tri Block in order to write a file using Java using file writer we will take our file writer which we named writer called the write method and then pass in a string let's say I like then pick your favorite food as you know my favorite food is pizza then after writing this file if we don't encounter any exceptions we'll print a confirmation message let's say the following file has been written all right let's test this file has been written since we didn't specify a file p your file is likely going to be within your Source folder and here's mine test.txt and it says the following I like pizza now you could pick a different location for example you could use an absolute file path so let's say I would like to write this file to my desktop so what I could do I'm going to go to my desktop I'm going to get the file location on my desktop I'll just right click on one of these folders go to properties copy this location then I'm going to paste that file path you'll likely need to use double forward slashes Java interprets a single forward slash as an escape sequence so you may need to use double slashes when I write this file it should be at this location this absolute file path Let's test it file has been written let's go to my desktop and here's that file test it says I like pizza let's say that we get the file path wrong instead of desktop I'll misspell this as deskto run this again we encounter that exception could not write file that's because Java couldn't locate this file path I misspelled it now when handling exceptions it is best practice to catch specific types of exceptions first here we're relying solely on our safety net that catches all input output exceptions another kind of exception that we can catch is the following file not found exception we will give this a nickname of e then we do need to import this class java.io file notfound exception this is if we can't locate a file or a file path is invalid so let's output the following could not locate file location let's try that again remember that my file path is misspelled could not locate file location let's spell this correctly this time I'm going to delete this file maybe I'll add another line of text I like pizza it's really good okay let's try TR that again file has been written going to my desktop here's that file and it says I like pizza it's really good for better organization what you could do is create a string a file path and set that equal to a string we're going to cut everything within our file writer and paste it within the string we're going to assign the string of text equal to a string variable a file path then we'll pass in the string variable to the file writer and instead of passing in a string literal to the right method of a file writer for better organization let's create a string of let's say text content equals and then we'll cut our text and then pass in the text content let's see I'll add another line I like pizza it's really good buy me pizza okay let's run this again file has been written go to our test file and here's our test file I like pizza it's really good buy me pizza if you have a string that takes up multiple lines another option is to write a multi multi-line string by using a triple set of double quotes So This is if you have a lot of text this time I'm going to write a poem roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty rocking everywhere all right so this is a multi-line string you use a triple set a double quote that's if you have a lot of text to write okay let's test it again file has been written let's go to our desktop open this file and here's our poem roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty rocking everywhere all right everybody so that is how to write a file using Java to write small or mediumsized text files you can use a file writer but you will need a try and catch block and well everybody that's how to write a file using Java
wsTSREgCE5E,Learn Java arraylists in 9 minutes! 📃,2024-12-08T15:49:38Z,all right people it's about time we get to array lists in Java an array list is a resizable array that stores objects you can store Primitives if so you'll be using autoboxing which we learned about in the last topic on rapper classes arrays are fixed in size but array lists can change their Dynamic here's how to create an array list first we'll follow our similar pattern with creating many objects in Java array list let's say list equals new array list we will need to make One Import import java. u. arraylist following the type of array list we're going to use the diamond operator this has to deal with generics which is a future topic but for now we're going to specify what type of object we're going to be storing within our array list and you can always use the appropriate wrapper class to store Primitives for example if you need to store integers you can say integer and then we do need that diamond operator after the second array list you don't also need to specify the data type within the second Diamond operator Java can infer that you're going to follow this pattern to create an array list this array list can store integers you just have to specify that type so for example let's take our list and add a few numbers three one and two and then we can print our list our array list I will print our list and we have three numbers 31 2 now if you were storing doubles you would set the type to be double and use the double wrapper class 3.14 1.99 2.01 I'm just making up numbers here there we go so let's store strings let's create an array list named fruits we will store the names of some fruit so the array name is going to be fruits and then we will print our aray list of fruits think of some fruit I will add an apple an orange a banana and a coconut that should be good enough for this example and now we have an array list of strings named fruits Apple orange banana coconut to add an element to an array list you can use the add method add is a built-in method of array lists to remove an element you can use the remove method then specify an index so let's take fruits and remove the element at index zero that should get rid of our Apple then we have orange banana coconut if we were to remove the element at index one that should get rid of our orange apple banana coconut there's also the set method take our Ray list of fruits called the set method add a certain index let's say zero we can set that element to be something else let's replace apple with pineapple replace the element at index zero with pineapple then we have pineapple orange banana coconut or index one would be apple pineapple banana coconut that's the set method with an array list to get an element at a certain index you can use the get method then specify the element number get the element at index zero that's going to return Apple get the element at index one would be orange two banana three coconut you can also get the size of an array list take your array list call the size method that will return the total amount of elements within your array list so my array list has four elements to sort your array list you will use the collections framework call the sort method and then pass in your array list our array list is named fruits and then you do need to import this class java.util do collections after sorting our array list let's print it print my array list of fruits so these all should be in alphabetical order starting with a for apple b for banana C for coconut o for orange so that's how to sort an array list you can use the collections framework you could use an enhanced for Loop to iterate through all the elements of an array list so the data type of my array list is strings we SP specified that type for every fruit in my array list of fruits let's print each fruit and here they are apple banana coconut orange all right so now we're going to cover an exercise we'll create an array and accept user input a user will enter in all the food that they want within this array list so to help us with this exercise we will need a scan scanner scanner scanner equals new scanner pass in system.in import this class and then be sure to close your scanner at the end because I tend to forget scanner. close we'll need an array list again we'll follow a similar pattern with creating objects array list let's say list equals new array list you using the diamond operator we're going to specify the type of what we're storing within this array list we'll stick with strings let's rename our list as Foods we'll be storing some food well at least the name of food we'll create a prompt we'll ask a user enter the number of food they would like to store enter the number of food you would like and I'll use print rather than print line for the user input we'll create a variable of num of food to store the number of food that we're going to store equals take our scanner call the next int method to get the next integer from the user once we accept an integer we should clear the input buffer because there's going to be a new line character within there take our scanner call the next line method to clear it let's do a test run enter the number of food you would like I'll just say three and that seems to work for now we have the number of food we're going to store within this array list in my example let's say I would like to enter three food items well we could use a four Loop to iterate three times we will ask a user to enter in a food three times then so we can use a for Loop for that within our for loop we're going to create a counter of I meaning index we can set that to be zero or one let's stick with one we'll continue this for loop as long as I is less than or equal to our number of food variable if I would like to enter in four food items this would be four so we should iterate this Loop for times we will increment I by One during each cycle of this Loop during each iteration of this Loop we will ask for a food item I'll use print rather than print line we will ask a user to enter food number then I'll add plus our index of I so during the first cycle I is going to be one then two 3 four so on and so forth then I'll add a colon then a space we'll create a local variable of food this will be of the string data type we will set the equal to use our scanner called the next line method to get a line of text from the user once we have our string of food we're going to add it to our array list of foods so take your array list of foods call the ad method to add an element we will add our string of food to our array list of foods and then once we're done let's print our array list using a print line statement we will print our array list of foods all right let's test it enter the number of food you would like I'll say four so we should ask for four food items enter food number one I'll say pizza hot dog hamburger and then Taco and here's my array list of food pizza hot dog hamburger taco all right everybody those are array lists an array list is a resizable array that stores objects you can store Primitives you're just going to use Java's Auto boxing feature if that's the case once you have your array list there's various methods to add remove or set elements and well everybody those are array lists in Java

hx_DRanBRRM,Learn Java METHOD OVERRIDING in 4 minutes! ♻️,2024-12-05T17:02:04Z,what's going on people today I'm going to discuss method overwriting using Java method overwriting is when a subass provides its own implementation of a method rather than use one that's inherited from a parent it allows for code reusability and you can give specific implementations of a method let me give you a demonstration we'll be creating a few classes file new class we will Begin by creating a class of animal then a new class of dog a class of cat then finally a class of fish dog cat and fish are going to extend the animal class after the class name type extends animal so let's do this with cat and fish the dog cat and fish classes are all children of the animal class animal class is the parent class there's not a lot we have to write with this example if a child class inherits from the animal parent class they will inherit a method to move let's define a method of move all we'll say is this animal is running we can keep the dog cat and fish classes empty for now so going back to our main Java file let's construct a dog object dog dog equals new dog a cat object cat cat equals new cat and a fish fish fish equals new fish all three of these animal objects dog cat and fish should have a move method let's take our dog call its move method same thing with the cat and the fish cat. move method fish. move method currently when we run this program we get the following output our dog is running our cat is running and our fish is running but fish don't have legs though they can only swim the move method that the fish class inherits isn't appropriate for that class this animal is swimming would be more appropriate so why don't we do this within the fish class why don't we do some method overwriting specifically for the fish class we will create a unique move method only for this class we will Define a new move method where we will say this animal is swimming however it is good practice to add this annotation of at override so that you and other developers know that this method is being overridden our fish class does inherit a move method from its parent of animal if you have the same named method defined in a child class you'll use that one first it has precedents going back to our main Java file let's call the move method for our fish our dog is running our cat is running but our fish is swimming within the fish class we have overridden the move method we have given a specific implementation for this method just for this one class the cat and dog classes will use what's inherited from their parents not only is a good practice to add this annotation of at override but let's say that you misspell this overwritten method rather than move let's say moves even though it should be move we're receiving a warning that this method does not override the method from its super class it's parent if you didn't have this annotation you may not notice that you misspelled this method and you're not actually overwriting it adding the at override annotation provides a system of checks and balances when overwriting method this error will go away once we actually are overwriting a method all right everybody so that is Method overwriting it's when a subass provides its own implementation of a method rather than use one that's already defined it allows for code reusability and you can give specific implementations of a method we'll be seeing method overwriting again with the two string method coming up in a future topic and well everybody that is method overwriting in Java a
ZD7CB6wKg8A,Learn CONSTRUCTORS in 10 minutes! 🔨,2024-12-05T17:01:50Z,hey yeah today we're talking about Constructors in Java a Constructor is just a special method within a class it's used to initialize objects by using a Constructor we can create objects with unique values when you create an object you can pass arguments to a Constructor to set up the initial values here's a demonstration what we're going to do is create a new class let's go to file new Java class let's create a class of students this will be the student class what are some attributes that a student should have they should have a name let me zoom in a little so you can read it an age int age a GPA meaning grade point average let's create a Boolean of is enrolled that is good enough for now there's one issue with this let's say that all students that I create using this class they're all going to be named SpongeBob going back to my Java file I'll create a few students we type the name of the class and name for this object let's say student one equals new student the name of the class again then we'll create a second student student 2 I'm going to Output student 1's name student 1name as well as student 2's name the issue that we have is that all students that we create all student objects they're all named SpongeBob what if we would like to give each object a unique name well we can do that with the help of a Constructor a Constructor is just a special method within a class to set up a Constructor we type the name of the class in this case student you need a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces we automatically call this Constructor when we instantiate an object of that class when we say new then the name of the class parentheses behind the scenes we're calling this Constructor and we can pass in arguments within the set of parentheses we can pass in arguments so let's pass in what are we missing a name age GPA is enrolled as well but we'll take care of that momentarily let's pass in a name age and GPA student one's name will be SpongeBob SpongeBob's age will be let's say 30 he seems about 30 SpongeBob's GPA can be 3.2 that's pretty good we have a warning our Constructor isn't set up to take these arguments going back to our Constructor since we're receiving arguments ments we need a matching set of parameters just like any other method we have a string for name integer of age double GPA we'll take care of these three first we have string name int age double GPA to assign some of these attributes we're going to use the this keyword this dot the name of the attribute this do name equals our parameter of name this. AG equals the age that we receive this. GPA equals the GPA that we receive going back to our Java file we can now construct an object if I attempt to run this currently we are receiving a warning our Constructor expects three arguments but we don't pass in any zero are found if I were to run this this we get this error message actual and formal argument lists differ in length in order for us to create a student object we have to pass in these three things a string for the name an integer for the age and a double for the GPA if we are missing these three we can't construct an object but previously we could without the Constructor for our second student let's pass in a name of Patrick Patrick pck will be 34 Patrick's GPA isn't too good it's a 1.5 all right let's test this we're printing student one's name and student 2's name we get SpongeBob and Patrick let's display some of the other attributes we have name age GPA we'll do this with student 2 as well student 2.age student 2. GPA SpongeBob SpongeBob is 30 years old SpongeBob's GPA is 3.2 these are all the unique attributes of our student object student one student 2's attributes are Patrick age is 34 GPA is 1.5 with the this keyword this refers to the object we're currently constructing or otherwise working with imagine that when we construct student one imagine we replace the this keyword with the name of the object we're assigning student one's name equal to the name that we receive same thing applies with our age and our GPA the same thing would apply with student 2 when we construct student 2 imagine during the process we replace this with student 2 this refers to the object we're currently working with or constructing with these parameter names they don't necessarily need to be the same as your attribute names just to demonstrate let's rename name as a ages B GPA S C this.name equals a this. ag equals B this. GPA equal C this should work too each object still has their unique attributes but I like to keep the parameter names the same as the attributes it makes the code easier to read and understand we haven't assigned to this attribute of is enrolled each object that we create using this Constructor let's assign this object's is enrolled attribute equal to you don't always necessarily need to assign arguments to these attributes for example let's just say that when you become a student you are enrolled that is true we don't necessarily need to pass in an argument for that going back to our main class let's print take student ones is enrolled attribute and then print it we'll do the same thing with student 2 Patrick when we create a student object we're automatically setting is enrolled to be true they are enrolled in classes and that applies to Patrick as well student too let's create another student object just so that we get the hang of this repetition is going to help you remember let's create student 3 student 3 is an object new student to create a student we have to pass in three things a string for the name an integer for the age and a double for the GPA student 3 will be Sandy Sandy is 27 let's say sand smart shall have a 4.0 GPA and then we'll print student 3's attributes student 3. name student 3's age student 3's GPA student 3 is enrolled our object of student 3 has these attributes Sandy 27 4.0 and true if your class has any methods for example all students have the method to study void study I'll just output the following let's take our name attribute but I'm going to use this.name plus the text of is studying let's delete these print line statements we'll take student one call the study method then we'll do this with student two and student three SpongeBob is studying Patrick is studying Sandy is studying after assigning values to your attributes using a Constructor you can use them within methods too or change them this refers to the object we're currently working with if student 3 meaning Sandy was to call her study method imagine we're replacing this with student 3 student 3's name attribute all right everybody those are Constructors they're a special method found within a class to initialize objects you can pass arguments to a Constructor when you initialize them they're used to set up the initial values when you construct an object a Constructor is automatically called when you create a new object but you need a matching set of arguments if there's any parameter setup just like any other method by using a Constructor we can create object objects with unique values and well everybody those are Constructors in Java
LN45TyPWAAg,Learn the Java super keyword in 10 minutes! 🔝,2024-12-05T17:02:01Z,"yo so let's get started today I got to discuss the super keyword super just refers to the parent class when using inheritance a child class is also known as the sub class the parent class is also known as the super class super just means parent for all intents and purposes the super keyword is used within Constructors and Method overwriting method overwriting is a whole another topic that we'll discuss we're more focused on Constructors in this topic we use the super keyword to call the parent Constructor to initialize attributes let me give you an example we'll be creating a few different classes let's go to file new class we will Begin by creating a class of person person will be the parent the super class let's say that any person object has the following attributes they will have a string of first meaning first name then string last meaning last name name we'll need a Constructor it's going to be the same as the class name Person parenthesis curly braces when we construct a person object we will need to pass in the following arguments a string for first name first and a string for last name last this object's first name attribute this. first equals the argument that we receive for first same thing applies with last this . last equals the argument we receive for last and then we'll create one method in this demonstration this method won't return anything we will name the method show name all we'll do is output the following this. first plus a space plus this. last okay let's test this class out person person equals new person but we do have to pass in a first and last name I've already used SpongeBob for too many examples so let's mix it up this time I'll pick Harry Potter or feel free to pick a different franchise that you like so one person from Harry Potter is Tom Riddle we have a person object with this first name and this last name first last our person is going to have a show name method show name then call it there we go there's our person objects first and last name Tom Riddle our person class will be the parent class we'll create a few other classes to inherit from this person class we're going to create a class of student that's going to inherit from the person class the student class will inherit these attributes and methods let's create create a new class of student student will extends the parent or super class of person since student is inheriting from person student is going to have a first and last name already and a show name method what other attributes does a student have that a person might not well students have a GPA a grade point average we'll declare that as an attribute double GPA we're going to create a student Constructor let's say that when we create a student we need to pass in a string for first name String first string last and double GPA what's their grade point average now rather than assigning our first and last name within this Constructor such as this. first equals first this. last equals last and this. GPA equals GPA we are receiving a warning there is no parameterless Constructor available in person we're not able to assign these attributes of first and last within the Constructor for student this is because student inherits from the person class since the Constructor of our parent requires a first and last name we we have to pass these arguments to its parent of person how we can do that going back to the child class we're going to be using the super keyword any arguments that the parent requires we have to send the parent these arguments from the child Constructor and how we can do that is use the super keyword and then pass in those arguments of first and last and now Java is Happy super just refers to the parent imagine that we replace the super keyword with person think of it like that and now this should work going back to our main file we should be able to create a student object student student equals new student we have to pass in a first name first name will be Harry last name will be Potter then we have to pass in a GPU because our student Constructor requires it Harry Potter has a 3.25 GPA let's say our student object should have these attributes this method and this attribute from the student class of GPA Let's test it student. show name this student name is Harry Potter and they should have a GPA let's print students GPA attribute 3.25 but not only that let's create a method to display their GPA within the student class we will create a method that doesn't return anything it will be show GPA we will output the following let's say this. first plus a string apostrophe s so Harry's GPA is plus this. GPA let's take our student object call the show GPA method that we have declared Harry's GPA is 3.25 let's create one more class we will create an employee class class employee employee will inherit from the person class employee extends person since employees aren't studying they're not students they instead get a salary we will create an integer attribute of salary and then we need that Constructor for our employee object all employees will require the following arguments a string for first name String first a string for last name String last and an integer for our employee salary I will attempt to assign these attributes for our employee again it's not going to work but let's try it this do first equals first this do last equals last this do salary equals salary again we're receiving that warning there is no parameter list Constructor available in person since employee extends person and our person Constructor requires a first name and a last name we have to send our person Constructor these arguments first and last so again going back to our employee class we will call the Constructor of our parent using the super keyword and then and passing in those arguments first and last let's create a method within our employee class void Show salary let's output the following we'll say this do first this person's first name apostrophe s we'll create the employee of Hagrid their salary is pick unit of currency I'll pick American dollars plus this do salary now we'll need to construct an employee object employee employee equals new employee we have to pass in a first name a last name and a salary in order to construct an employee object we're going to pick Hagrid Hagrid's first name is actually rubius last name hrid hrid salary will be $50,000 let's say all right let's take our employee call its Show salary method and there we go rubius also known as hrid rubius salary is $50,000 in conclusion super refers to the parent class student and employ inherit from person since the Constructor of the parent of person requires a first name and a last name any children objects that we create we have to call the Constructor of the parent and pass in those arguments to satisfy Java if the parent didn't require these arguments then you wouldn't need to and well everybody that is the super keyword in Java"
DYbi93vuSaU,Learn Java Object Oriented Programming in 10 minutes! 🧱,2024-12-05T17:01:46Z,"yo we have finally made it to object-oriented programming in Java so what is an object exactly look around wherever you're sitting right now you are surrounded by different objects for example next to me I have my phone a cup of coffee and a microphone in programming an object can represent a real world entity they can do one of a few things objects can hold data and they can perform actions the data they hold are known as attributes the actions that they can perform are known as methods objects can have things and they can do things some attributes that a person may have would be a name their age their height and their weight a few methods meaning actions that a human could do a person well they could eat and they could sleep objects are reference data types we store the data for an object in a location known as the Heap in thison ation we're going to be creating some car objects but we'll need a Class A Class can serve as a blueprint to create objects so what we're going to do is create a new Java class we will create a class of car we have two classes our main class and our car Class A Class can behave as a blueprint for creating objects we'll start by listing the different attributes that a car may have so what does a car car have exactly well a car could have a make that would be a string we can assign it if we would like think of a car youd like or a car you drive I'll pick my favorite car the make will be Ford another attribute could be a model and I will pick a Mustang cars could have a year that would be an integer into Year I'll pick the year 2025 a price that could be a double double price equals let's say $58,000 99 a car's engine could be running that could be a Boolean Boolean is running I will set that to be true or false if the car is turned off things that an object has in this case car these are known as attributes they are things that an object has now heading back to our main class we will create a car object we're already a little familiar with working with objects for example a scanner is an object to create a scanner we would type scanner scanner equals new scanner then you type system.in or with random objects we would type random random equals new random Now to create a car object we're going to be utilizing this class we'll type car then think of a name for this car we'll just say car all lowercase equals new car we're following a similar pattern car car equals new car we don't need the scanner or this random object I was just demonstrating something we now have a car object that we can use our car object has these attributes these things if I was to print my car object here's what we can see well since objects are a reference data type if you were to print your car directly you get a memory address if you need to access one of these attributes you have to follow the object name with a DOT a DOT is known as the dot operator it allows you to access things within an object if I need the model of my car I would take my object name use the dot operator followed by the attribute name if I was to print the model of my car that would output Mustang let's print some of the other attributes car. make who manufactures the car Ford what is the year of my car car. year 2025 what's the price car. price $58,000 99 is my car running or not car. is running false the car is not currently running you can modify and change these attributes too with our car object let's access the is running attribute I will set that to be true like we're turning the car on is running is now true because we changed the attribute of his running not only do objects have the capability to hold data meaning attributes they can perform actions they can have their own methods going back to our car class we'll Define a few methods what sorts of actions can a car take well we could start a car within this class we will Define a method we don't need that static keyword this time we need a return type we'll say void we're not returning anything we will Define a method of start let's do the following let's output you start the engine we'll create another method void stop let's say you stop the engine so now with our car we can delete these print line statements we'll take our car object using the dot operator call the start method this should output you start the engine or we could stop car. stop you start the engine you stop the engine not only that Within These methods let's change one of these variables one of these attributes within our start method let's take is running set that to be true within the stop method we'll take is running set that to be false going back to our main class before starting the car let's output car. is running after starting the car let's let's output car dot is running and then stopping the car we'll output car dot is running the car is currently not running that's false you start the engine the car is now running that's set to true you stop the engine the car is no longer running that is false let's add two more methods we can start we can stop we can drive we'll create a method to drive void Drive Drive let's output you drive the I'm going to use string concatenation we'll concatenate the model of the car so my car is a Mustang we will create a method to break you break the plus our model variable our model attribute we can delete these lines of code let's drive the car car. drive you drive the Mustang and here's the model of the car and we can break car. Brak you drive the Mustang you break the Mustang there's one issue with this though with our class of car every car that we make has the same attributes and methods we can only create 2025 Ford Mustangs if I was to create another car object let's say car car 2 equals new car we'll rename the first car as car one and I'll output some of their attributes Car 1make Plus a space plus car one model we'll do this with our second car object too Car 2 car 2. make car 2. model these cars have the same attributes it would be nice if we had a way to customize them so that each car is unique because currently they're all the same they're different cars but they have the same attributes and methods which is kind of lame that's why in the next video we're going to discuss Constructors by passing in arguments we can create unique objects in summary an object is an entity that holds data it has attributes and they can perform actions they can perform methods they have things and they can do things and well everybody those are objects in Java"
Qf3Nczxm2AY,Learn Java 2D arrays in 9 minutes! ⬜,2024-12-05T17:00:49Z,hey there everybody so today I'm going to explain 2D arrays in Java also known as multi-dimensional arrays a two-dimensional array is an array where each element is an array it's useful for storing a matrix of data let me give you an example let's say we have some basic one-dimensional arrays I will create a string array of fruits think of some fruit I'll add an apple an orange and a banana then I'll create another separate array let's create a string array of vegetables think of some vegetables I will add a potato an onion and a carrot let's create one more I will create a string array of meats I will add chicken pork beef let's add one more and fish these three arrays are all separate one-dimensional arrays well what if I told you we can make an array made of arrays where each element is an array here's how we're going to combine all these arrays together into a grid or Matrix I will create a two-dimensional array of strings we will need two sets of straight brackets I will name this two-dimensional array groceries and then we need our curly braces this two-dimensional array each element within this two-dimensional array is going to be an array we have fruits vegetables and meats let's attempt to display these elements you can use a for Loop or enhanced for Loop within this for Loop what is the data type of each element well each element is a string array so we need to list the data type as a string array let's give a nickname of each element as Foods in our two-dimensional array of groceries let me show you what happens if I print each element within our two-dimensional array of groceries I will print each array of foods here's what we got well we get a bunch of memory addresses because arrays are a reference data type we're referring to some place in memory we'll need to use a nested Loop and enhanced for Loop would be good for this with each of these arrays what is the data type of each element within each well we're working with strings so the data type is going to be string let's give a nickname of each element as food in our array of foods during each cycle of this Loop let's print not print line each food and then I'll add a space here's what we got currently we have our first array and our second then third after finishing each array I'm going to add a new line character we can use aint line statement for that here's what we got now what we have is a grid or Matrix of data you could say that there's columns and rows each row is a separate array now when initializing an array you don't necessarily need names let's remove fruits copy the elements of this array including the curly braces and paste them within this two-dimensional array just for readability I'm going to place each row on a new line let's replace vegetables with the elements including the curly braces same thing applies with meats and we can delete all this this would work the same groceries is a matrix of data a grid let's print this and that works the same if you ever need to access or change an element you'll need to use two indices for example let's replace apple with a pineapple we will take our two-dimensional array of groceries and list two indices the first index applies to the row the second index applies to the column so we're saying at rows 0 column 0 we can change it or access it let's say that row zero column zero is now a pineapple rather than an apple then we have pineapple orange banana let's replace our potato with something else that would be Row one column zero Row one column zero is now celery celery onion carrot let's replace the carrot with celery then that would be Row one column 2 0 1 2 Row one column two potato onion celery let's replace pork with eggs that would be row two 0 1 2 column 1 0 1 row two column 1 is now eggs we have chicken eggs beef fish to access or modify an element within a 2d array you need to list two indices the first for the row the second for the column okay now we're going to create a mini project we'll create a two-dimensional array that resembles a telephone number pad this two-dimensional array will be made up of characters the data type is Char and then we have two sets of straight brackets let's name this two-dimensional array telephone equals we have an array of arrays we'll have four rows and just for readability I'm going to place each of these on a new line just so it resembles a grid or Matrix for the first row we'll will have 1 2 3 and these are all characters not strings we're using single quotes not double quotes for the second row we'll have four five six the third row will be 7 8 9 now for the last row we'll have an asterisk character zero and pound or hashtag as I like to call it so here's our Matrix our grid of characters we have an array of arrays it has rows and columns now let's display our data we'll need nested Loops for this our outer for Loop is going to be in charge of the rows what is the data type of each element within this two-dimensional array well each row is an array of characters that's going to be the data type of the outer for Loop we have an array of characters let's give a nickname of each inner array as a row in our two-dimensional array of telephone for every Row in our telephone do this then we'll need a nested Loop what is the data type of each element within each array their characters the data type will be Char let's say for every number in each array of row we'll print the following we'll use print rather than print line we'll print each number and I'll add a space character let's do a test run after each row I'm going to print a new line character so when we escape the in four Loop I'll add an empty print line statement and here's our telephone we have rows and columns it's a two-dimensional array of characters so those are two dimensional arrays they're an array where each element is an array it's useful for storing a matrix of data we probably won't be using 2D arrays too often but you should still be familiar with them and well everybody those are two dimensional arrays in Java
ah5bAnGpmKY,Enter USER INPUT into an ARRAY! ➡️,2024-12-05T16:59:29Z,what is going on everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can enter in user input into an array so let's get started before assigning values into an array our compiler needs to know the size of the array beforehand we have to first allocate space for the array let's begin by creating an array of strings we'll create an array of strings we'll enter in some food I will name this array Foods equals add a set of cly braces and then within this array you can enter in some values pick some food that you like I'll enter in a pizza taco and hamburger the size of this array is three elements once you set a size for an array normally you can't change it this array will have three elements however all the elements are already filled with values to create an empty array you don't want a set of empty curly braces then we're creating an array of no elements just to demonstrate that I'm going to to print the length of our array Foods foods. length this is going to give us0 and we can't assign any values even if I attempt to let's say Foods at index zero equals a string of pizza here's what happens well we have an exception and array index out of bounds exception before assigning values we'll want to be sure that we're setting a size of the array even if it is empty instead of assigning a set of values we'll create an empty array we'll set our array equal to use the new keyword type the data type of our array straight brackets and within the straight brackets we'll set a size a number so let's say three we're creating an empty array that has space for three elements three values let's try this again the length of our array is three and we can assign the values so let's say Foods at index one equals a taco Foods at index 2 will be a hamburger I'll print all the foods in this array we can use an enhanced for Loop list the data type we're working with an array of strings for every food food in our array of foods we will print each food that would give us pizza Taco hamburger we have declared and instantiated an empty array and filled in the values later let's modify this program so a user can type in some values let's delete these lines if we're accepting user input we will need a scanner we'll declare that and instantiate it scanner scanner equals new scanner within the set of parentheses type system.in import the class for scanner import java.util.scanner and close the scanner when you're done because I sometimes forget to do that still scanner. close so we have an empty array of three elements we'll create a for Loop to iterate over the length of our array of foods so four we create a counter of in I equals z will continue as long as I is less than our array of foods length property which returns three because there's three elements then increment I by One during each iteration of this Loop let's do the following we'll output the following prompt enter a food I'll use print instead of print line because I prefer that we'll assign our array of foods at index of I I changes during each cycle at first it's zero then one then two then three we'll set that equal to use our scanner to accept some user input call the next line method okay let's perform a test run currently we have an array with three empty elements we'll cycle this loop three times because the length property of the array is three then print all the elements when we're done here's what happens exactly enter a food pizza Taco hamburger here are the elements within our array of food pizza Taco hamburger let's say that we changed the size of the array let's say for this time Pizza Taco hamburger hot dog Pizza Taco hamburger hot dog we're going to make a few changes instead of setting a static size for the array we'll have a user enter in the number of food they would like to enter we'll replace this number with a variable to determine the size what we'll do now is we will declare our string array of foods but instantiate it later once we know the size we'll output what number number of food do you want I'll use print instead of print line I'll also create an integer variable of size I'll declare it but not yet fill it in until after our prompt let's set the size the size of the array that is equal to use our scanner and call the next int method we are accepting an integer once we know the size of the array we can finish instantiating it let's take our array of foods that we've declared but have not yet assigned and we'll assign it our array is made up of strings we'll use the new keyword new list the data type string it's an array so we need a set of straight brackets and instead of a number we're going to use our variable the user is going to determine what this number is going to be there's one final step this is is specific for scanners since we're accepting an integer and then we're accepting a string for our user input we have to clear the input buffer next integer isn't going to pick up the new line character at the end so just to demonstrate that let's say we want one food item there's still that new line character within the input buffer we didn't get the opportunity to enter in a food we are just going to clear our scanner by using scanner. next line will clear it up all right let's try this again what number of food do you want I want five five food items entering some food pizza Taco hamburger hot dog and Sushi and here's our food pizza Taco hamburger hot dog sushi in summary to enter in values into an array you'll likely want to create an empty array but you need to know the size of the array first if the size of the array is predetermined you can always set that to be a number otherwise if one way or another if a user is going to determine the size of the array you'll have to get that from the user and you can set the size of the array to whatever the user types in just be sure to do that before filling in the values if you would like a copy of this code you can look in the comment section down below be sure that you're looking in the playlist and well everybody that is how to enter an user data into an array okay using Java
9dr2mHYYoug,Learn Java arrays in 9 minutes! 🍎,2024-12-05T16:59:12Z,what is going on everybody in this video I'm going to discuss arrays in Java an array is a collection of values of the same data type as a beginner it might be helpful to think of an array as a variable that can store more than one value it's a little more complicated than that but that might be a good way to think of it let me give you a demonstration suppose we have a string variable a fruit pick a fruit I will pick an apple and then you know we can print our variable of fruit which would give me an Apple well what if I told you that this variable can store more than one value if we were to turn it into an array here's how after the data type of our variable add a set of straight brackets enclose any values within a set of curly braces and there we go we now have an array we have an array of strings this array can store more than one value but they all have should be the same data type in this case strings let's add some more fruit let's add an orange a banana and a coconut the name of your array should be descriptive of what it contains let's say fruits instead of fruit technically in the English language fruit would still be plural but by adding an S it's more descriptive that it contains more than one value I know English is is a weird language at times if I was to print my array of fruits here's the result while we get a memory address arrays fall under the category of a reference data type if we access the name of our array we're given a memory address each value within an array is known as an element to access an element we have to indicate an index number after our array name let's add a set of straight brackets and then an index number as is the case with many things in programming taxis the first of something it usually has an index of zero that applies to arrays as well print our array of fruits at index of zero that's going to give you the first element of Apple for the next element that would be an index of one which is orange two would be banana three coconut if we attempt to access an element that doesn't exist here's what happens we get an exception an exception is similar to an error we have an array index out of bounds exception this error message appears when you try and access an element that doesn't exist within an array there is no index of four there's only 0 1 2 3 in this case now you do have the capability to change the value at a given index to do so we will take the name of our array in this case fruits specify an index using the set of straight brackets at index of zero let's set that equal to a string of pineapple rather than Apple and then we'll print it print our array of fruits at index of zero that would give us a pineapple rather than an apple by specifying the index you can change any element so fruits at index of one is now a pineapple if at any time you need the length of an array there's a built-in property for that let's say we have an integer variable of num of fruits meaning number of fruits to access the length of an array take our array in this case fruits use dot which is the axis modifier then type length give me the length of my array of fruits how many elements are within this array take a guess four there's four elements within this array 1 2 3 4 if you ever need the length of an array use the length property of your array this will return an integer which you can assign to a variable if you would like if you need to print all of the elements of of an array you could use a for Loop here's how well declare for Loop we'll create an index of I equal to zero how many times do we want to iterate this Loop let's continue as long as I is less than we need to determine the length of this array well we can use that length property that we discussed take our array of fruits access the length property this should return the number four continue as long as I is less than four then we will increment our index of I so our for Loop in this case is going to iterate four times let's perform a test run if I was to print my array of fruits at index of zero this is what happens exactly it's going to print fruits at index zero four times apple apple apple apple what I need is to print each element of this array we could use our index V for that so replace zero with i i is going to change during each iteration of this loop we're increasing it by one after we complete each cycle of the loop so here's what happens now we get all the elements of our array Apple orange banana coconut this index of I is going to increase after each cycle of this Loop each iteration alternatively rather than printing each fruit on a new line we could use print then after printing each element we could add a space character that would print each element and separate each with a space if you so choose there's something called an enhanced for Loop an enhanced for Loop will cycle once for each element within an array we'll start with a normal for Loop to create an enhanced for Loop within the set of parentheses we will list the data type of each element of the array in this case strings now we need a unique identifier for each element within this array since we're working with an array of fruits let's say fruit singular then we need a colon then our array that we're iterating through in this case fruits basically we're saying for every fruit in my array of fruits do this let's print each fruit fruit will be the current element we're cycling through here's what happens we print each fruit we have all the elements of our array of fruits Apple orange banana coconut this is an enhanced for Loop also known as a for each Loop it simplifies iterating through a collection such as an array if you need to sort your array there's a built-in sort method we're going to access the class of arrays you may need to import it import class arrays so make sure you have this import import java.util.arrays this class provides a lot of functionality when working with arrays there's a built-in sort method we're going to pass in our array of fruits to this method meod we'll end up sorting the elements in this array alphabetically originally the order of our elements was Apple orange banana coconut but after sorting they're now apple banana coconut orange they're all arranged alphabetically or if these were numbers they would be arranged in ascending order there's also a fill method with arrays we can fill all the elements of an array with a given value again we're going to access the arrays class called The Fill method pass in our array comma the value we're going to fill the array with let's fill our array with pineapples then we'll use a for each Loop to print each element and here's our new array we have filled our array of fruits with the value of pineapple all right everybody that's an introduction to arrays than think of an array as a variable but it can store more than one value and well everybody those are arrays in Java
iGo1Syv4YuM,Learn BREAK &amp; CONTINUE in 2 minutes! 🚦,2024-12-05T17:00:20Z,I have a pretty short video for you today we're going to discuss two important keywords when it comes to Loops break and continue break is used to break out of a loop continue skips the current iteration of a loop think of the break keyword as the stop button on a remote continue would be similar to skip with break we're stopping with continuing we're skipping let me give you a demonstration let's create a for Loop that will iterate 10 times let's say in I equals 0 will continue as long as I is less than 10 then increment I by One during each iteration I'll just print I then add a space here's what we got we have the numbers 0 through 9 so let's say when we reach five I would like to break out of the loop we're going to stop it well I could add an if statement let's say if I is equal to 5 then we will use the break keyword and break out of the loop entirely here's what happens once we hit five we break out of the loop previously we continued all the way until 9 now with the continue keyword we don't break out of the loop we just skip the current iteration like a skip button on a remote this time let's use continue rather than break and we'll see the differences between the two now since we're using continue the number five is missing we skipped that specific cycle of the loop and went back to the beginning that's why five is missing between four and six but we still continue to the end when working with loops if you ever need to break out you can use the break keyword to skip the current iteration you can use continue and well everybody that is both the break and continue keywords in Java
nhnAx79gxCM,Learn Java overloaded methods in 6 minutes! 🍕,2024-12-05T16:58:43Z,hello everybody in this video I'm going to explain overloaded methods in Java in Java overloaded methods are methods that share the same name but they have different parameters a method's name plus its parameters will give you a unique method signature each method signature needs to be unique no two methods can share the same signature but they can share the same name let me give you a demonstration let's say we have a method it's going to return a double the method name will be add we'll add two numbers together add is the method name and then we'll set up some parameters we'll have double A for the first number and Double B all we're going to do is return a plus b it's a simple method so I'm going to print add the numbers 1 + 2 and then print it this will give us three what if I would like to add a third number you can see that Java is already giving us a warning expected two arguments but three found so if I were to run this program we get an error actual and formal argument lists differ in length one solution is that I could create another method also named ad but it has different parameters where we accept three numbers so let me just copy this method paste it then I'll add another parameter for Double C return a plus b plus C and that should work now the number is six these two methods share the same name but they have different parameters so that's actually legal in Java a method's name plus its parameters will give you a unique method signature no two methods can share the same signature with our second method let's delete the last parameter of Double C and attempt to run this and we'll see what happens exactly well we get an error message method add is already defined in class main Java is saying that we have two methods that share the same name and the same exact parameters methods can share the same name but they need different parameters if that's the case now if I would like to add another number like four I could create a another overloaded method also named add but this one will have four parameters Double D return a plus B+ C plus d and this works too let's go over another example let's pretend that we're baking a pizza we'll have a string variable of pizza we'll create a method to bake a pizza but we have to pass in ingredients we'll declare method with static will return a string that's the return type the method name will be Bake Pizza our parameters are going to be a set of ingredients for this method we'll just accept a string of bread we'll just return our bread variable plus the word pizza so this could be for for example a thick crust pizza or a flatbread pizza so to say let's set our pizza variable equal to called the bake pizza method now this method only has a bread setup as a parameter an ingredient let's say flat bread for the bread and then we'll print our pizza system. out. print line our string variable of pizza here's what we have we have a string of flatbread pizza so when baking a pizza there's a lot of different ingredients let's create another method of baked pizza but we have a parameter of bread and a parameter of cheese let's copy this method paste it but we have to change the parameters we're already receiving a warning we'll have string bread and string cheese no pun intended let me zoom in now those warnings have went away we have two methods with the same name but they have different parameters which is fine we can do that so this time let's return a string of cheese plus a space character plus our bread plus the word Pizza let's pass in a type of cheese Mozzarella I probably misspelled that actually I spelled it correctly okay now we'll bake our pizza we have a mozzarella flatbread pizza if there's two or more methods with the same name we'll end up using the method where the parameters match we'll create one more overloaded method we'll create another baked pizza method but this one will have a custom topping string topping we'll return topping plus a space character plus everything we had previously then we can pass in A new ingredient how do you spell pepperoni I can never spell it pepperoni now this time we have a pepperoni mozzarella flatbread pizza all right everybody so those are overloaded methods methods can share the same name but they need to have a different list of parameters a method's name plus its parameters will give you a unique method signature and no two methods can share the same signature and while everybody those are overloaded methods in Java
44iQGNUcik0,Java substrings are easy! 📧,2024-12-05T16:54:49Z,all right everybody in this video I'm going to explain how the substring method Works in Java substring is a method that's used to extract a portion of a string strings have a built-in method of substring within the substring method you can list one of two indices this method will create a new string based on the positioning of the indices the start and the end I can best demonstrate this with us creating an email slicer program so what we'll do in this demonstration is create a string of email type in your own email I don't want to give you guys my actual email because some of you guys are weird no offense my email will be bro1 123@gmail.com our variable of email is a string strings have a built-in method of substring we can create a new string from portions of the original string here's how let's say I would like the first six letters but depending on your own email it may be different the substring method will return a new string so let's create a new variable the data type of string of username equals to create a substring we will take the original string use the substring method then list one of two possible indexes or indices the first index will be zero at what position would we like the substring to end I would like to end right before this at sign so that would be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 the second index is exclusive so we're creating a new string of username by using the substring method of our original string of email then let's print it to test it we will display our username and now we have a new string mine is proo 123 but depending on what you wrote for your email it may be different now I would like a new substring of every character after the at sign this will be a variable named domain what is the domain of our email again we're taking our original string using the substring method then list one of two possible indices so again let's count this is index zero because in programming we tend to start with zero 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 so 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 then we will display our domain so my domain is gmail.com within your substring method if you have a starting index but you would like all the characters that come after all the way till the end you don't necessarily need an ending index we could just say seven that would work too gmail. there's one issue with how we wrote this program what if somebody has a different length of an email there's a greater or lesser number of characters so let's say I have a different email this program doesn't work as intended it's not flexible so my domain is 1@gmail.com I could modify the indices of the substring method so 0 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 then the domain would be N9 because I want everything after the at sign and then my username let's check that so this would be my username bro code one to make this program more flexible instead of manually entering the indices we can determine what this number should be with another string method we're going to use the index of method in place of a number we're going to find the at character let's replace our second index with email our string dot use the index of method then we will find the index of our at character we're going to replace this number with email. index of and find the at sign so now let's try printing our username so here's my username then let's print the domain currently we have that at sign the index of method returns a number which we're using as the index it's returning the index of this at sign I'm going to increase it by one so we get everything after the at sign so plus one and now the at sign is removed even better yet let's accept some user input we'll need a scanner import java.util.scanner we'll create a scanner object scanner scanner equals new scanner then we will need system.in then when we open a scanner it is a good idea to close it when we're done with it I sometimes forget we'll create a prompt for a user to type in their email enter your email I'll use print instead of print line I'm going to declare my variables after our scanner that's just how I like to arrange things we'll declare our email but not yet assign it same thing applies with our username and our domain we've already declared these variables we don't need to do that again instead of manually assigning our email we're going to use our scanner to accept user input scanner. nextext line let's display our username and our domain okay enter your email I'll make up something bro1 123@gmail.com here's my username and the domain we can take this a step further too we can check to see if our email is valid we'll use some of the string Methods we learned about in the last video so after accepting our email we're going to write an if statement if our email contains the at character our email is only valid if we have this at character if it is then we'll perform all this code so let's cut it then stick it within the if statement else we will do something else let's print emails must contain at let's type in an email that's not valid I won't include the at sign emails must contain the at character let's try that again fake guy one at maybe they're using using Yahoo yahoo.com so my username would be fake guy one the domain is yahoo.com all right everybody so that is the substring method and how to create an email slicer program the substring method is used to extract a portion of a string you can list one of two possible indices within the substring method a starting index and an ending index we use the substring method on an email then created two new substrings one of username and the other of domain and well everybody that is the substring method in Java
DFhpzaEOoxs,Let&#39;s code a WEIGHT CONVERTER in Java! 🏋️,2024-12-05T16:55:05Z,hey everybody in this video we're going to create a weight conversion program to convert a weight from pounds to kilogram or vice versa it will help us become more familiar with if statements so let's get started okay let's get started everybody what might be helpful to you as a beginner when creating a project is to use comments to describe what you want to do at each part of your program this is also known as pseudo code for example the first thing we'll do is declare our variables declare variables then we'll create a message then a prompt for user input prompt for user input or Choice we'll say option one convert lbs meaning pounds to kgs kilograms option two convert kgs to LBS if somebody doesn't select option one or two we'll use an else statement else print not a valid choice so here's a rough outline of our program and what it's going to do we'll begin at the top we'll declare any variables that we'll need so we will need a scanner we'll create a scanner object scanner scanner equals new scanner then type system.in within the set of parentheses if you hover over the word scanner you can import it automatically import java.util.scanner or otherwise you can type it in what are some other variables we'll need double weight for the original weight double new weight that's after we convert the weight we'll need to store it and int Choice a user is going to type in one to convert pounds to kilograms or two to convert kilog to pounds we have our variables now we need a welcome message I'll use a few print statements let's say weight conversion program one C in space this means option one convert lbs meaning pounds to kgs kilogram or Choice two two colon space convert kilog to pounds lbs then we'll prompt for a user's Choice I'll use print instead of print line choose an option then we'll need to store that choice variable Choice equals use our scanner to accept user input we're accepting an integer we'll use next int let's do a test run and I will print our choice temporarily weight conversion program one to convert pounds to kilograms or two to convert kilogram to pounds I'll type in one we get one or two then we output two we can delete this print line statement we were just checking to see if it works okay option one if somebody selects option one we have to convert pounds to kilograms well we'll need to check to see if choice is one we can use an if statement for that if choice is equal to one be sure you use double equals that is the comparison operator we're checking if these two values are equal if you use a single equals that is the assignment operator and Java thinks you're trying to assign one to choice so double equals for comparisons we're converting pounds to kilograms we'll ask a user to enter the weight in lbs I'll use print instead of print line we will assign our weight equals use our scanner then use the next Double method then we will accept a double value so once we have our weight we have to convert it to kilogram because it's currently in pounds we will assign our new weight equal to the weight our current weight that is times 0.45 3592 then we'll output the new weight the new weight in kg s is then we'll add our new weight okay let's perform a test run we'll type in one to convert pounds to kilogram enter the weight in pounds what's 150 lb converted to kilogram 68.0 388 if you would like to limit the amount of digits that display after the decimal you can use a print F statement instead of print line so to do that we'll convert this to print F where we would like to insert a value or variable we'll use percent since we're displaying a double we'll use f meaning floating Point number to display two digits after the decimal we'll use 0 2 or 0.1 to display one digit depending on your preference replace the plus with a comma we're inserting this variable at this location this placeholder let's perform that again choose an option convert pounds to kilograms enter the weight in pounds 150 is good the new weight in kilogram is 68.4 kg now if Choice equals 2 we're going to convert kilogram to pounds and really we can just copy this if statement paste it then convert it else if choice equal 2 the user wants to convert kilog to pounds enter the weight in kilog the new formula is going to be weight time 2.2 0462 the new weight in pounds lbs is our new weight let's try it choose an option we will convert kilograms to pounds I'm going to press two enter the weight in kilogram let's say 68 kg the new weight in pounds is 14991 lb what if somebody types in a number that's not valid so we can get rid of this comment is use an else statement to print that the user didn't select a valid choice we will follow this with an else statement we will follow else if with an else statement else print that was not a valid choice we have options one or two if I type in three we execute the else statement that was not a valid choice and again like usual I'm forgetting to close my scanner because I sometimes forget to do that so at the end of your program close your scanner scanner. close because you don't want to leave resources open okay let's do one final test run let's convert pounds to kilograms what's 200 PB convert it to kilograms 90.7 2 all right everybody so that is a weight

23VT2wh3BG4,Nested if statements are easy! 🎟️,2024-12-05T16:56:03Z,what is going on everybody in this video I'm going to explain nested if statements in Java in Java it is possible to have if statements within other if statements kind of like this after checking some condition you could follow with another condition if the first condition is true you can add if statements lse if statements and or else statements really depends on the program that you're trying to write so what we're going to do in this demonstration is have two Boolean variables a Boolean of is student let's say that we're selling movie tickets if somebody's a student they get a 10% discount on their movie ticket we also have a senior discount Boolean is senior if somebody is 65 or older they get a 20% senior discount or if they're a student and a senior they get a combined total of 30 % off their ticket price let's say we have a double of price the price of a movie ticket will be $9.99 let's say that's actually kind of cheap nowadays we write an if statement to check to see if somebody is a student if a student is equal to true but since this is a Boolean variable we don't need the equals true portion we can just say if a student I will go ahead and set this this to be true right away so if somebody is a student they get a student discount else they won't so if a student is true let's output the following you get a student discount of 10% then we will take our price price equals price times 0.9 that will give you a 10% discount you could shorten this using the augmented assignment operator price times equals 0.9 that will set the price to be 90% or a 10% discount so to say if somebody's not a student they're going to pay full price price times equals 1 that really doesn't do anything but it might help with this visualization then we'll output the following the price of a ticket is pick unit of currency then I'll add our price let's perform a test run currently we're a student you get a discount of 10% the price of a ticket is $8.99 to limit the amount of digits that display let's use a print F statement we'll use print f F instead of print line after the dollar sign I will add a format specifier we're going to display a double we'll use f for a floating Point number comma price to display two digits after the decimal use 2 now we can display a price you get a student discount of 10% the price of a ticket is $8.99 now if we weren't a student I'll set this to be false we don't get that discount the price of a ticket is $9.99 what it was originally now what if somebody is a senior and a student within our if statement we'll write an nested if statement as well as an else statement if is senior they get a student discount and a senior discount let's cut these two lines with in the if statement and sticking within the nested else statement if somebody is a senior and a student you get a senior discount of 20% and a student discount of 10% so let's take our original price times equals 0.7 and an additional 10% off the original so let's say is senior is true for now okay else if they're not a student but they are a senior we'll check that with a nested if statement within the else statement if is senior they get that senior discount but it's only 20% instead of 30 because they're not also a student price time equals 0.8 you could add else price times equals 1 that's if somebody is not a student and not a senior but you don't necessarily need the sell statement all right let's perform a test run let's say that we're not a student and not a senior the price of a ticket is $9.99 what if we were a student but not a senior you get a student discount of 10% the price of a ticket is $88.99 what if we're not a student but we are a senior you get a senior discount of 20% the price of a ticket is $7.99 what if we're both a student and a senior you get a senior discount of 20% you get a student discount of 10% the price of a ticket is $6.99 that's how nestive statements can be useful you could check another condition after checking a condition already so that's just one example of nested if statements and well everybody those are nested if statements in Java
IgdIfGW-cVU,Code a Java compound interest calculator in 7 minutes! 💸,2024-12-05T16:52:19Z,"hey everybody this video serves as a project we're going to create a compound interest calculator using Java if you put money in a bank account or the stock market using the given formula we can determine what our final amount is going to be plus interest after a given amount of time this project serves as an exercise using Java let's begin all right let's get started everybody the first thing we'll need is a scanner we'll need to import it at the top of our Java file import input import java.util do scanner we need to create a scanner object again scanner scanner equals new scanner then within the set of parentheses type system.in when you open a scanner it is good practice to close the scanner when you're done with it so you don't leave any resources open after creating our scanner here are the different variables we'll need double principal this will store the principal amount what's our original investment an interest rate double rate an integer for times compounded how often does our interest compound like yearly quarterly monthly then we need an amount of time such as years in years and the final amount double amount now we have to get some user input we'll need some prompts first we need the principal amount I'll use system.out.print enter the principal I never spell principal right enter the principal amount we are working with the double so we need the next Double method of our scanner principal equals our scanner next Double then we need the interest rate this is going to be a double system.out.print enter the interest rate I'll add within our prompt that this is in a percentage form like 5% or so the number five instead of 05 so then we have our interest rate so we need our scanner. next Double so let's say somebody types in five for 5% we would like the rate to be 05 rather than 5 after accepting the user input let's divide that number by 100 or let's say somebody types in seven we don't want the rate to be seven we want it to be 07 that's why we're dividing by 100 we'll fill in the times compounded variable we're going to use print enter the number of times compounded per year so this could be yearly that would be one quarterly four or monthly would be 12 in most cases it's probably going to be one for yearly times compounded equals use our scanner. next int because we're accepting an integer then we need the amount of times our money is going to be invested enter the number of years then we need to assign our variable years years equals scanner. next CU we're working with an integer then we need to calculate the total amount here's the formula amount equals we need our principal amount times access the math class use the power method raay is 1 + the interest rate divided by the variable times compounded so this is going to be the base we comma separate the base and the power we are raising this part of our equation to the power of times compounded times the number of years and that's our formula it's a little confusing but it should work then we will display the amount system.out.print line the amount after plus years plus is pick a unit of currency I'll pick American dollars plus amount Let's test this so let's say we have $110,000 or so and we're putting it in the bank what is the interest rate maybe 3% so I'm going to type three enter the amount of times compounded per year I'll go with one enter the number of years one so we should have 10,300 in our bank which we do 10,300 if you would like you can use a print F statement to format the output so if you're familiar with that let's replace print line with print F instead of concatenating these variables We'll add some placeholders instead so to display an integer we need percent D within print F years is then to display a double we need percent F then we'll list our arguments years comma amount so to display two decimals within a double between the percent and the F we're going to type 2 to display two digits after the decimal we'll proceed this placeholder with the unit of currency let's do American dollars okay let's see the total amount enter the principal amount $10,000 enter the interest rate 2% enter the number of times compounded per year this time let's do quarterly so four because there's four quarters in a year enter the number of years let's do two actually and here's the amount in our bank account after 2 years $1,477 all right everybody so that is a compound interest calculator you can can write using Java"
8KCuHHeC_M0,Learn Python in 1 hour! 🐍,2024-08-18T14:00:05Z,in this video I'm going to teach you as much python as I can in exactly 1 hour if you would like a quick introduction or you're transitioning from another programming language this video is for you if you would like to go more in depth I do have a full free 12-hour course on my channel otherwise let's get started I don't like boring introductions so I say we just jump right in there's two things we'll need to download the first is a python interpreter to convert our written code to machine code we're going to head to python.org go to downloads and download the latest version we will open this executable if you're on Windows you'll want to check this checkbox add python exe to path and we will install now the setup was successful and that's all you need to do to download the python interpreter the second download we'll need is an IDE an integrated development environment basically a place where we can write code for idees there's two popular choices when writing python code py charm and vs code if you already use vs code you can stick with that just be sure to download the python extension I find py charm more beginner friendly if you've never coded before if you would like to use pycharm go to Jet brains /py charm and we will click this green download button there's two versions of py charm the professional version and the community version the professional version is paid for I would not recommend using it only because there's plenty of free idees on the market we'll use the Community Edition the free one because I don't like to pay for things and I'm sure you don't either select the correct download for your operating system I'm running Windows I will download pycharm we will open this executable click next you could select a destination folder I'll keep it as is next I'll create a desktop shortcut but you don't necessarily need to click next install and we'll just have to give it a moment okay the setup is now complete I'll check this checkbox to run py charm when we close this window after opening py charm we're going to create a new project you can rename your python project I'll keep it as is you can select a location again I won't change that you can create a sample welcome script but for this tutorial we won't let's select the latest python version and create our new project in the menu to the left we're going to create a new python file file new python file let's name this file main but really you can name it anything and select python file python files end with the py file extension we should have our main python file within our python project folder now we're going to print something to the console window within our main python file we're going to write a print statement so type print add a set of parentheses between the set of parentheses we will add a set of double quotes to print something or single quotes either one my own preference is double quotes normally in a programming tutorial the instructor would tell you to print something such as hello world but we like to be different here instead think of your favorite food in this case I like pizza I will print I like pizza to run our Python program we will click the screen Arrow to run our main python file we should have a console window that displays our output I like pizza or whatever your favorite food is let's print another line of code let's print it's really good by adding a second print statement we are printing a second line of code now we'll discuss comments the python interpreter doesn't output comments to write a comment you use a pound sign I like to call this a hashtag my comment will be this is my first Python program comments are used as notes for yourself or for other people reading this code if I were to run this code again this comment is not displayed to the output we still have I like pizza it's really good all right everybody so that is your very first Python program and in the next topic we'll discuss variables all right we're moving on to variables a variable is a reusable container for a value there's four data types that you need to know as a beginner strings integers floats and booleans the variable behaves as if it was the value that it contains to create a variable we need a unique name we'll include our full name so we will create a variable named full name equals some value now a string is a series of characters this can be within double quotes or single quotes in Python personally I like to use double quotes so why don't you type in your full name I'll use my YouTube channel name now with a variable it will behave as if it was the string of characters I could use it within a print statement to print a variable the easiest way is to use an F string F then a set of double quotes f means format using an F string we can insert a variable wherever we would like so I'm going to say hello to insert a variable you need a set of curly braces then we can place that variable name within that set of curly braces so now my output is Hello Bro Code that's a string it's a series of characters then we have integers integers are whole numbers an example of an integer would be an age let's say that my age is 25 I wouldn't be you know 25.5 integers are whole numbers then let's output our age print I'll use an FST string Ur at a placeholder insert our variable age years old then let's run this hello bro code you are 25 years old floats are numbers but they contain a decimal a good example of this would be a GPA a great point average let's say that my GPA is 3.2 3.2 out of 4 let's print our GPA using an F string your GPA is at a placeholder insert our variable GPA your GPA is 3.2 then we have booleans booleans are either true or false let's create a Boolean variable is student this is either true or false do pay attention to the capitalization true and false need to be capitalized so let's say that I am currently a student now with booleans we typically don't output them directly but we could I'm going to use an F string and let's say are you a student and then I will add a placeholder display our Boolean variable are you a student that is true or I could say that this is false if I am not a student maybe I've graduated you can output a Boolean directly but typically we use them internally within a program such as when using an if statement we haven't reached if statements yet but I just want to show one use of booleans we might say if is student if this is true then we will print you are a student if a student is false then we would print something else such as you are not a student is student will be true this will print you are a student if it were false we would instead print you are not a student we'll cover if statements a little bit later but that's where booleans are useful we tend to use them internally within a program all right everybody so those are variables they're a reusable container for a value and well everybody those are variables in Python okay everybody so now I'm going to show you some basic arithmetic in Python here's a few arithmetic operators we have Plus for addition minus for subtraction asterisk for multiplication a forward slash for division two forward slashes for integer Division and then the modulus operator which gives us the remainder of any division we'll begin with addition let's say we have a variable of friends I will set that to be five then I will print my variable of friends now I'm not using an F string only because I don't have any additional text to WR I'm just outputting the variable so friends contains a value of five I can increment the amount of friends I have by one by using addition so let's take friends equals friends + one basically we're taking 5 + 1 then reassigning it to our variable of friends which gives me six I could increase it by two or even three there is a short cut to this because this can be a lot to write we can use an augmented assignment operator where we would say friends plus equals 1 to increment by one that gives me six or two or three so unlike other programming languages python doesn't have an increment operator such as Plus+ here we have a syntax error so to increment by 1 we would have to say plus equals 1 or some other number if you're choosing depending on how much you want to add then we have subtraction let's subtract one friend friends equals friends minus one that would give me 4 minus 2 would be 3 or we could use the augmented assignment operator which would be minus equals let's say 1 which gives us 4us - 2 would be 3 - 3 would give us 2 that's subtraction then we have multiplication let's double the amount of friends that we have friends asterisk 2 asterisk is used for multiplication so 5 * 2 is 10 friends * 3 is 15 the augmented assignment version would be time equals some number so friends time equals 2 would be 10 3 would be 15 4 would be 20 then we have division standard division returns a floating Point number a number that contains a decimal let's divide the amount of friends that we have by two friends equals friends / two that gives me 2.5 and this is a float a floating Point number even if our friends divided evenly 10 / 2 we still have that point Z at the end it's a floating Point number and not an integer so the augmented assignment version of this would beward slash equals what are we dividing by we will divide friends by two which gives us five or three which gives us 3.33 3 3 3 3 3 33 repeating then we have integer division which is two for slashes integer division division returns an integer rounded down let's take friends equals our friends variable use integer division divided by 3 we will round down to the nearest whole integer which is three because 10 does not divide by three evenly then using integer division divided two would give us five whole numbers then again the augmented assignment version of this would be 2/ es equals use integer division to divide by three that gives us a whole number of three then we have the modulus operator represented by a percent which would instead give us the remainder let's say with all of our friends we're all in the same classroom and the teacher says to get into groups of three I'm going to create a new variable of remaining friends equals our group of friends modulus 3 the modulus operator gives us the remainder of any Division 10 does not divide by three evenly how many friends do we have remaining one that's John John knows what he did he's the one friend remaining that's not paired up all right everybody so those are some basic arithmetic operators in Python we have addition subtraction multiplication division integer Division and the modulus operator which gives you the remainder of any division and well everybody that is basic arithmetic in Python all right everybody so we are moving on to typ Casting typc casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another we have various functions to convert a value or variable to a string an integer a float or a Boolean let's create some variables we will create a name variable type in your full name an age make up some age a GPA for grade point average let's say minus 3.2 and a Boolean of a student are we currently a student let's say that's true now you actually could get the data type of a variable or a value by using the type function then pass in a value or variable however when I run this there's no output so I need a print statement we will print what is returned by the type function get the type of our name variable then print it so our name variable is a string St Str our age variable is an integer and int GPA is a float is student is a Boolean using these typ cast functions we can convert from from one data type to another here's how let's start with something simple let's convert our GPA to an integer currently it's a float I will reassign GPA use the int function to typ cast to an integer then pass in my GPA at the end we will print our GPA if we typ cast 3.2 to a whole integer what would the result be a whole integer of three we truncate the decimal portion let's convert our age to a floating Point number we will reassign our variable of age use the typ cast function of float then insert our age variable let's print our age variable and it should be a floating Point number 25.0 now we'll cover strings let's typ cast our age to be a string age equals called the typ cast function of string St Str pass in our age variable so the result is still going to appear the same 25 however it's a string not an integer and to prove that I will enclose my age variable with the type function the type of variable age is a string it would be the same as if we're taking this number and enclosing it within quotes So this would make a difference because let's say that I add one to age age plus equals 1 well we would get a type error can only concatenate strings not integers to a string however if I were to add a string of one to the end we would be using string concatenation so let's say it's my birthday and I add one to 25 well since we're working with strings now the result would be 251 I am 251 years old so strings and numbers behave differently with numbers we can use them within arithmetic Expressions strings not so much we will take our name variable and typ cast it to a Boolean name equals call the typ cast fun function of BU passing our name variable this has an interesting result so I'm going to print name booleans are either true or false if I typ cast my string of text into a Boolean that gives me true now it really doesn't matter what I write here if I were to change my name to a single character such as B this would still be true if our string variable was empty there were no characters within it that would actually give us false we could use this to check to see if somebody enters in their name or not if somebody types in their name then we typ cast it to a Boolean if somebody skips entering in their name that would return false we could reprompt the user to enter in their name again all right everybody so that is typ casting it is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another this is especially useful with handling user input because user input is always a string there may be at times where you want to convert it to an integer a float or a boan and well everybody that is typ casting in Python okay we're moving on everybody how can we accept user input in Python here's how we will use the input function we will enter in the input within the console window however we need a prompt what do we want the user to type in let's ask for the user's name enter your name this prompt will appear in the console window enter your name and then we can type in our name although we're not doing anything with it currently when we accept user input let's assign it to something let's create a name variable name equals our user input enter your name type in your name name hit enter when we type in our user input it's going to be assigned to this variable of name let's print it to test it I will print my name to the console window and to your name I will type in my full name hit enter and it displays what's within my name variable let's use an F string this time let's display hello our name variable and to your name type in your full name hit enter hello whatever your name is in my case bro code now when we accept user input it's always of the string data type to test that I will print the type of our name variable type in your name again so the data type of our name variable is a string you may want to typ cast it to an integer a float or a Boolean this time let's say that we need an age variable age equals the input function we will prompt the user to enter your age then we will print the user's age using an F string you are insert age years old let's run this again enter your name type in your full name enter your age type in your age hit enter hello bro code you are 25 years old the data type of our age is going to be a string Let's test that I will print the type of our age variable again we have to follow the prompts our age variable is a string let's say that it's my birthday I will add one to age age equal age + 1 or we could short this to Agee plus equals 1 as a shortcut here's the result enter your name enter your age and we get a type error can only concatenate strings not int to string if we accept user input and we have to use that input for any sort of arithmetic Expressions we'll have to convert it to either an integer or floating Point number since I'm working with whole integers we can typ cast our age as an integer age equals use the int typ cast function then pass in our age then I can add one to age AG plus equals 1 so this should technically work type in your name type in your age and we will add one to age hello bro code you are 26 years old there is a way in which we can condense these steps rather than taking up a separate line where we're typ casting our agent variable let's enclose our input function with a typ cast function of int after receiving user input we'll typ cast it to an integer ENT your name and your age and now we can add one to age because it's a whole integer hello bro code you are 26 years old all right everybody so that's how to accept user input you use the input function whatever you type into the console window you can assign to a variable with user input we are given a string value you may have to typ cast it as a beginner you can type cast to an integer a floating Point number or a Boolean value and well everybody that's how to accept user input in Python okay everybody we are moving on to if statements with if statements they allow for basic decision making we can execute some code only if a condition is true in this demonstration let's say we have a variable of age we will accept some user input we will ask the user to enter your age then we will typ cast this input as an integer because when we accept user input it's of the string data type to write an if statement we will type if then we will check a condition let's check to see if the user's age is greater than or equal to 18 colon then any block of code underneath an if statement should be indented if this condition is true then we will perform the following let's print the following message you are an adult let's perform a test run and to your age let's say that I'm 21 hit enter you are an adult if this condition were false here's what happens enter your age let's say that I'm 12 hit enter nothing happens if this condition is false we skip over this block of code like it never happened otherwise we could do something else with an else Clause again the block of code underneath an else Clause is indented we will print the following instead you are a child let's perform a test run again and to your age let's say that I'm 12 we instead print whatever is within the else clause you are a child so by using IF statements they allow for basic decision making between if and else we could add else if e l if so let's check to see else if age is less than zero technically somebody shouldn't have a negative age let's instead print the following you haven't been born yet and to your age let's say that I'm -1 years old you haven't been born yet with if statements else if Clauses and else Clauses we go through these statements one by one when one of these is true we skip the rest of the Clauses and continue with the rest of the program you can add as many else if Clauses as you would like let's add another else if age is equal to zero to check to see if a value is equal you use double equals this is the equals comparison operator if you use one equals python thinks you're trying to assign something python in this case thinks I'm trying to set age to be zero so to see if a value is directly equal you use double equals if our age variable is zero then we will print the following you word just born and to your age let's say that I'm zero you were just born let's add one more else if Clause else if age is greater than or equal to 65 then we will print the following you are a senior citizen now check this out let's say that I'm 7 70 years old you are an adult why do we execute this block of code where age is greater than or equal to 18 rather than this one where we're checking if age is greater than or equal to 65 we're going through these statements one by one beginning from the top technically the statement was true 70 is greater than or equal to 18 so we execute this block of code and skip the rest the order of your if and else if statements does matter let's check to see if our age is greater than or equal to 65 first so let's put this in the front turn it into an if statement then convert this statement to be an else if Clause now it should work just fine let's say that I'm 70 you are a senior citizen the order of your if statements and else if Clauses does matter we also could check Boolean values too let's say we're going to a movie theater we will have a Boolean variable of has ticket have we pre-ordered a ticket for the movie this will be true or false a Boolean let's say that we have a ticket I'll add another if statement to check so with a Boolean we will check if has ticket now we don't necessarily need to say is this equal to true we could just write that Boolean value or variable if has ticket if this contains true then do the following let's print you may enter you have a ticket else let's print something else you need to buy a ticket so again our variable of has ticket is true so first we have to enter our age let's say that I'm 25 you're an adult you may enter you have a ticket I set the variable of has ticket to be true let's set this to be false enter your age 25 you are an adult you need to buy a ticket because we do not currently have a ticket let's add a few more lines to these if statements let's say that if we're a senior citizen we get a discount on the price of a ticket but first we should set the initial price let's say that the price of a ticket is $10 if we're considered an adult then let's print the following I'll use an F string the ticket price for an adult is We'll add a placeholder and insert the price I will preedee this price variable with a unit of currency I'll pick American dollars so if we're a child let's let's say the price is 50% off we get a discount the ticket price for a child is price time 0.5 if we're a senior citizen we get a 25% discount the price for a senior is price times 0.75 these other LF statements are kind of distracting so let's delete them we'll just stick with these three statements enter your age let's say that I'm 25 hit enter you are an adult the ticket price for an adult is $10 you need to buy a ticket because we do not currently have a ticket let's say that I'm 70 you are a senior citizen the ticket price for a senior is $7.50 you need to buy a ticket let's say that we do have a ticket and we are a child I am 13 years old you are a child the ticket price for a child is $5 you may enter you have a ticket all right everybody so those are if statements we can execute some code only if a condition is true if statements allow for basic decision- making we have if statements else if Clauses and else Clauses and well everybody those are if statements in Python all right people we're talking about logical operators today logical operators allow us to evaluate multiple conditions we can link them together there's three we'll discuss or and not we'll begin with OR with or we can check more than one condition if at least one of those conditions is true then the entire statement is true here's an example let's say we have an outdoor event and I will create two variables one temp meeing temperature let's say that this is in Celsius 25° C pick Fahrenheit if you would like and I will create a Boolean variable of is raining I will set that to be false it is currently not raining if the temperature is too hot too cold or it's raining then I will cancel this outdoor event we'll write an if statement to check that if our temp short for temperature is greater than let's say 35 35 degrees CSUS then I'll use the or logical operator or if our temp is less than zero or if is raining is true if one of these conditions is true we're going to cancel our outdoor event so let's print the following the outdoor event is cancelled else we will will print something else the outdoor event is still scheduled the temperature is reasonable and is raining is false it's not raining so we print the else Clause the outdoor event is still scheduled what if the temperature was really hot like 36° C well the outdoor event is cancelled what if it's cold -5° the outdoor event is canceled this condition was true therefore we execute the if statement or what if the temperature is reasonable but it's raining is raining is true well then the outdoor event is still cancelled so with the or logical operator at least one of these conditions needs to be true if one of these conditions is true you could consider the entire statement true now let's cover and with and we can link two conditions together both conditions must be true in order for that entire statement to be true so again let's say we have temp short for temperature and we have a Boolean variable of is sunny I will set that to be true we will check if our temp is greater than or equal to 28° C and is it sunny is sunny if it's hot and if it's sunny if this is true let's print the following it is hot outside for fun I'm going to add an emoji but you don't have to I just think it's more entertaining that way but you do you and I will print it is sunny sometimes these emojis are formatted differently I'm just going to copy it from somewhere else that's better currently the temperature is 25 25° C and it's sunny this condition was false but this one is true with the and logical operator both conditions must be true in order for us to execute this block of code if our temperature was 30 30° C well then both conditions are true it is hot outside and it is sunny let's write a few more let's add else if else if the temp is less than or equal to zero and is sunny we will print something else it is cold outside I'll change the Emoji and it is sunny let's set the temperature to be5 5° it is cold outside and it is sunny both these conditions are true so we do this instead you can link as many conditions together as you would like let's see if our temperature is within a certain range else if temp is less than 28 and our temp is greater than zero and is sunny to check to see if something is within a certain range there is a shortcut too P charm is recommending this we can simplify change comparisons so this effectively does the same thing if 28 is greater than our temp and our temp is greater than zero and it's sunny then we will print it is warm outside rather than hot and it's still sunny so let's say our temperature is 20° C and it's sunny it is warm outside and it is sunny now we have the not logical operator it inverts the condition we are checking to see if something is either not false or not true so let's check to see if it's not Sunny really I'll just copy what we have and paste it else if nut is sunny then that means it's cloudy and let's use a cloud Emoji so basically not does the opposite of what you're looking for we are checking if not is sunny is sunny is false then this condition is true okay let's say our temp is 28 is sunny is now false it is hot outside it is cloudy what if our temperature was Zero it is cold outside it is cloudy what if the temperature was reasonable like 20° C it is warm outside it is cloudy so not it inverts the condition if it's true it's now false if it's false it's now true all right everybody so those are logical operators they allow us to evaluate multiple conditions with or at least one condition must be true with and both conditions must be true and not not does the opposite it inverts the condition we check if something is not false or not true and well everybody those are logical operators in Python now we're covering while loops a while loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains true we recheck the condition at the end of the loop here's an example I have a condition if 1 is equal to 1 this would be true then we will print the following I am stuck in a loop if statements only execute once I am stuck in a loop let let's replace if with while and see what happens I wouldn't recommend doing this but you can watch me we're going to execute this code Forever at the end of our while loop we recheck the condition again there's no way for us to escape this Loop hence I am stuck in a loop we're repeating it forever that's how a while loop and an if statement are different if statements are executed once while Loops could execute forever you should put in some way to escape the while loop let's go over another example let's say we accept some user input name equals input we will ask a user for their name enter your name now let's say that somebody doesn't type in their name I'm just going to hit enter at this prompt our name is an empty string an empty set of quotes if somebody skips an entering in their name let's write a while loop while our name is equal to an empty string and empty set of quotes if a user doesn't enter in their name let's reprompt them again so in order to escape this while loop the name that the user enters in can't be empty and then once they do escape the while loop let's print the following I'll use an F string hello insert a placeholder name if I'm supposed to enter my name then hit enter we get that prompt again we are now stuck within the while loop and I can't escape until I type in something so let's type in our full name hit enter and now we escape the while loop hello whatever your name is if we type in our name right away we actually don't enter the while loop at all we check check the while loop once and enter it if this condition is true since our name was not empty since it wasn't an empty string we skip it entirely so after our while loop let's ask for a user's age age equals input enter your age and then I'll typ cast this input as an integer since we're working with whole numbers while our age variable is less than zero then we'll do the following let's perform two actions let's print age can't be less than zero and then we will ask for the user input again then when we escape the while loop we will print hello the user's name and the user's age you are at a placeholder age years old all right so in this program we have two while Loops I'm just going to change one thing after age I'm going to add a colon then a space just to make it look better so let's enter our first name enter your age if I type in an age that's less than zero we'll be stuck within this while loop let's say I'm negative-1 years old age can't be less than zero and to your age2 age can't be less than zero negative kajillion age can't be less than zero okay let's say that I'm 25 hello bro you are 25 years old while Loops are really good for accepting user input if somebody enters in a value that's not valid you can reprompt them again that's a great benefit of wild Loops all right everybody so those are wild Loops we can repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains true we recheck the condition at the end of the loop if that condition is still true we perform another iteration of that while loop and well everybody those are while Loops in Python all right everybody so we are moving on to for Loops a for Loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a string list topple or set but we still need to talk about these three topics but we will soon or we could use a for Loop to repeat a block of code an exact amount of times with the while loop we will execute some code possibly infinitely with a for loop it's limited so let's say we would like to count to 10 we can do that with the for Loop fairly easily here's the formula for we need an index the developers usually shorten this to I I meaning index in now what number do we want to count up to we will say range range is a function then pass in 10 we will do something 10 times so let's print I I is our index our counter we will iterate this Loop 10 times so we begin at zero actually and go all the way to 9 but technically it's a total of 10 to set the first number to be something other than zero we can specify that let's say one then where would we like to end the second value is going to be comma separated so let's say 11 the second number is exclusive the first number is inclusive print the value of I our index from the range between 1 and 11 exclusive that would give us 1- 10 I could change these around too let's say 91 through 101 that would be 91 through 100 so again the first number is inclusive the second number is exclusive let's count from 1 to 10 again so 1A 11 we could count by twos that would be the third value comma two we will count by twos 1 357 9 basically we're incrementing our index of I by two during each iteration or three we'll count by threes 1 4 7 10 and then four would be let's find out 159 we even could iterate over strings as well anything that is considered iterable so let's say we have a string of name type in your full name let's change this for loop around rather than saying for I our index we could rename this to something let's say letter for every letter in our iterable of name print each letter then let's see what happens we get each letter on a new line at the end of each print statement we print a new line character rather than a new line character let's make one following change let's set the ending character to be something else like a space we will print each letter but separate each letter with a space or we could even do a dash it's your choice now here's a mini project that we'll do we'll count from 10 down to zero then display happy new year so we need a for Loop to iterate backwards let's say for I our counter our index in range now we'll begin at 10 and end at zero zero is exclusive to count backwards we'll set the step the third value to be NE -1 then let's print I our index so then we should count backwards starting at 10 ending at 1 now let's do this when we escape the for Loop let's print happy new year so we start at 10 count down to one then display Happy New Year to actually simulate a countdown we can import the time module this will be a mini project let's let's import the time module at the top after printing I let's access the time module call the Sleep Method then pass in one to sleep for 1 second now we'll have a countdown timer starting at 10 once we reach zero we will display happy New Year all right everybody so those are four Loops they're used to iterate over a sequence such as a string list topple and set these three we're going to talk about next or we can repeat a block of code an exact or certain amount of times such as counting down from 10 and well everybody those are four Loops in Python all right people we have an important topic to discuss today and that is lists tles and sets if you come from a different programming language these three collections are all similar to arrays but in Python we have three different varieties each has their own benefits let's start with the list I have a variable of fruit let's say fruit is an apple well with a variable a variable can only contain a single value with a list we can contain multiple values to create a list we will enclose all values within a set of square brackets each additional element within this list should be comma separated so let's let's include an orange a banana and a coconut that's good enough for this example let's rename fruit as fruits so people reading this may recognize that this contains more than one fruit if I was to print my list of fruits here's what's returned to us we print out the entire list including the set of straight brackets at the beginning and the end to get one of the elements within this list you'll use the index of operator which is a set of straight brackets for the first element that's going to have an index of zero the element at index zero would be the first item within my list of apple one would be orange two banana three coconut if I attempt to access an element that doesn't exist we get an index error list index is out of range you could use a for Loop to iterate and print each element within the list let's say for every fruit in my collection of fruits I will print each fruit that will give me Apple orange banana coconut now you don't have to do this but I'm going to end each character with a space rather than a new line just so it's easier for me to read lists are mutable and they're the most flexible out of the three I can change one of these elements at a given index let's say fruits at index of zero is now a pineapple rather than an Apple so that should change the element at the first index to be a pineapple or let's say fruits at index 3 is a mango then we have apple orange banana mango go we can append elements using the append method take our list of fruits use the append method what would we like to append to the end let's append a mango then we have apple orange banana coconut mango we can remove elements take our list of fruits called the remove method let's remove our banana apple orange coconut we can pop meaning we can remove an element at a given index so take fruits call the pop method let's pop the element at index zero that's the first now we have orange banana coconut let's pop at index one which gets rid of the orange two would be the banana three would be the coconut and then if we go out of bounds we get an index error pop index out of range so that's the pop method then if you ever need to clear your list you'll take the list of fruits call the Clear method that will remove all the elements from your list so lists are mutable meaning we can change the elements and they're the most flexible we can change the element at a given index append elements remove elements pop elements and we can clear the elements our next type of collection is a tupple they behave similarly to lists however rather than enclosing all of your elements within a set of straight brackets you'll enclose them within a set of parentheses where topples differ is that they're immutable meaning we can't change the elements once the tupple is created but this makes them faster it's faster to access the elements of a tupple rather than a list so py charm has even given me a warning tupples don't support item assignment if I attempt to change the element at index zero to be uh let's keep that as a mango well we get a type error tupple does not support item assignment once we create a tupple we can't change the elements they're immutable even if I was to append a new element fruits. append I will append a mango again again we get that attribute error tupple has no attribute append I can't remove either I will attempt to remove an apple again tupple object has no attribute remove topples are good if you need a collection that can't be changed the benefit of this is that they're faster to access then we have sets which are probably the most complicated all your values will be enclosed within a set of curly braces we can add and remove elements but we can't replace any of the elements within it that's because sets are unordered so to demonstrate this I'm going to print my set of fruits the order is going to change each time during this first run we have coconut then Apple orange then banana if I run this again we get apple coconut banana orange then coconut banana apple orange sets are unordered we can't access them by index so let's say fruits at index0 is now a pineapple while sets do not support item assignment that's because they're unordered whatever is at index zero within our set is going to change each time they're unordered however we can add and remove elements and we would use the add method to do that rather than than append So within our set let's append a mango so we have a mango within our set but the position changes each time we can remove fruits. remove let's remove the coconut so the Coconut's gone let's attempt to pop fruits. pop at index zero again we can't work with indices type error pop takes no arguments and we can still clear fruits. CLE sets also don't allow for any duplicates what if I were to add just a bunch of coconuts to the end well we still only have one coconut where sets are really good is for membership testing checking to see if there's a given value within your set here's how we can do that I'll write an if statement if the word apple is in our set of fruits if this statement is true then let's print Apple was found else we will print something else print Apple was not found so apple is currently within our set Apple was found but what about a pineapple let's change Apple to Pineapple currently there's no pineapple pineapple was not found we even could accept user input let's say fruit equals input enter a fruit to search for if our fruit variable is in fruits let's convert these print statements to an F string add a placeholder fruit our fruit was found if this is true else our fruit was not found enter a fruit to search for is there an orange orange was found is there a mango main go was not found sets are efficient for membership test in meaning checking to see if there's a given element within that set art everybody so those are lists topples and sets lists are mutable meaning we can change the elements and they're the most flexible tupples are immutable but they're faster than lists sets are mutable only when adding and removing elements they're unordered we can't access a set by an index they don't allow for duplicates and sets are the best for membership testing and well every everybody those are lists tles and sets in Python
4wGuB3oAKc4,Python Projects for Beginners 🐍,2024-08-13T17:29:32Z,"hey everybody this is a compilation of more than 20 Hands-On projects from my python series on YouTube these projects range in level from absolute beginner to the intermediate level feel free to check out additional lessons on my channel now normally I would say sit back relax and enjoy the show but since this is a Hands-On based project series instead I encourage you to lean forward focus and get coding hey everybody this is a remake of my python calculator program for absolute beginners all you need to know to complete this exercise is just if statements and how they work so let's get started for this exercise a user is going to select an arithmetic Operator Operator equals input we will ask the user to enter n operator this will be plus for addition minus for subtraction as risk for multiplication and a forward slash for division you could enter more than this but I don't want to make this exercise too complicated we will create a variable of num one to contain our first number let's say we would like to add two numbers together what is the first number going to be enter the first number and let's do this with the second number num two enter the second number let me show you something I'm going to add num one and num two together num one plus num two we'll do a test run enter an operator I would like to use addition enter the first number 10 and 11 well the result is 101 when we accept user input they are string data types what we've ended up doing is string eation we've concatenated the string of 11 to 10 that's why we ended up with 101 we'll have to convert these two strings to be floating Point numbers by typ casting them as a float so enclose your input functions with a typ cast of float and now we should be able to add those two numbers together so let's add 10 and 11 and we get 21.0 depending on the operator that the user selects we'll use some if statements to determine that we will check if our operator variable is equal to a character of plus and for now I'll write pass as a placeholder we'll get back to this later else if our operator is equal to minus we will use subtraction and for now I'll write pass else if operator is equal to an asterisk for multiplication we will multiply else if our operator is equal to a forward slash for division we will divide if our operator is addition let's create a variable of result result equals num one plus num 2 for subtraction it's going to be num one minus num 2 multiplication would be num one * num 2 then division would be num one divided by num two then we just have to print the result print our result be sure to do this with each of the LF statements as well and let's see what we have let's add 5.5 + 6.9 that gives us 12.4 let's subtract 420 - 0.69 that gives us 49.3 let's test multiplication multiply 3.14 * 3.14 which gives us 9.8 596 then division let's divide 69 by 133 and that gives us a really long number so you could round a number if you would like we would enclose our result within the round function and we'll just update each of these print statements this will round to the nearest whole integer so let's divide 420 by 13 let's say that we would like three digits after the decimal within the round function we could add comma 3 for three decimal places enter an operator let's use division divide 420 by 69 so that gives me 6.87 so we can round to a given digit after a decimal in this case three places what if somebody types in an operator that doesn't exist like the word pizza then I will divide two numbers well let's add an L statement if somebody selects some input that is invalid let's let them know I'll use an F string let's say that the operator that the user has selected is not valid and let's try this again enter an operator Pizza enter the first number 420 and 69 Pizza is not valid let's say is not a valid operator instead that makes more sense pizza will be my operator first number is 420 second number is 69 Pizza is not a valid operator all right everybody so that is a very simple python calculator program you can make as a beginner hey there it's me again in today's topic we're going to create a weight converter program in Python this is an exercise that will follow up the lesson on if statements we'll convert pounds to kilog or kilog to pounds the user is going to decide we will Begin by creating a weight variable we will assign some user input enter your weight we will convert this input into a floating Point number so add that cast then we will ask for a unit is this weight in kilogram or pounds input kilogram or pounds we want the user to type in either K for kilog or L for pounds and these are capital letters by the way using an if statement let's first check to see if our unit is equal to a capital K that means the current weight is in kilogram we need to convert that weight to pounds let's reassign weight equal to our weight time 2.205 else if unit is equal to l we need to convert to kilogram weight equals weight / 2.205 else the user did not type in something that was valid let's print using an F string unit was not valid at the end of our program we will print the new weight I'll use an F string your weight is our new weight after it's reassigned now we need a unit of measurement this is what I'm thinking we'll do within our if and else if statements let's reassign our unit we're reassigning unit to be lbs for pounds else if unit equals kgs for kilogram in our results we will display our new unit let's take a look enter your weight actually I'm just going to make one change I'm going to add colon space there that's much better enter your weight let's say I'm 180 lb this is in pounds I'll type capital l your weight in kilog is 81.6 3 I think I'm going to round this I will enclose the weight variable within a round function we will round to one decimal place let's try this again ENT to your weight maybe I'm 81 kilg I'll type K for kilogram your weight is 178.6 lb let's make sure that this lse statement works too ENT to your weight 180 pizzas pizzas was not valid so we're still displaying our output we would want to avoid that if somebody doesn't type in a valid unit so let's cut this line then paste each within the if and else if statements when we exit the else statement we're not printing the output so let's make sure that this works and to your weight I am 180 p pizzas pizza was not valid all right everybody well that is a weight converter program in Python I thought this would be a helpful exercise now that we have finished the section on if statements and yeah that is a weight converter program in Python hey everybody in this topic we're going to create a temperature conversion program as an exercise we'll Begin by asking what the current unit of measurement is unit equals will accept some user input is this temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit C slf then we will ask for the temperature I'll store the temperature in a variable named temp meaning temperature temp equals input enter the temperature then we should cast our user input as a floating Point number if unit is equal to C I'll fill this in momentarily I'm just going to write pass as a placeholder else if unit is equal to f we will do something else else let's print something just an error message of some sort using an FST string unit is an invalid unit of measurement Let's test this lse statement is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit what if I were to type K for Kelvin I'll make up some temperature like 100 K is an invalid unit of measurement all right we know the L statement Works let's convert Fahrenheit to Celsius using this formula we will take our temperature equals 9 time R temp / 5 + 32 I'll take all of this and use the round function we'll round to one decimal place then we will print the current temperature in fahrenheit I'll use an F string the temperature in Fahrenheit is our temp variable degrees Fahrenheit let's test this if statement is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit it is currently in Celsius what is 30 3° in Celsius converted to Fahrenheit the temperature in Fahrenheit is 91.4 De all right so this section is working let's work on the else statement else if our unit is currently in Fahrenheit we'll convert to Celsius that formula is temp equals our temperature minus 32 * 5 / 9 then I will round the result to one decimal place then we'll print the temperature in celsius the temperature in Celsius is temp de C for Celsius is the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit it is currently in Fahrenheit enter the temperature 91.4 the temperature in Celsius is 33.0 De C well everybody that is a simple temperature conversion program in Python I thought we could use some practice with if statements and in the next video we're going to create a calculator program hey everybody in this topic we're going to create an email slicer program I was going to create this program as an exercise at the end of our string indexing video but I completely forgot so I'm going to make a separate video on it it's it's a fairly straightforward program it won't take too many lines of code all right let's begin we'll accept some user input we will store this as a variable named email email equals input will create a prompt enter your email for my email example let's say my email is bro1 123@gmail.com there is a built-in method of strings called the index function this function index will return the first instance of a character let's find the index of our at symbol we'll split the email by username and domain but we need to know where to split it exactly at this at symbol so we will find our index of that at symbol equals take our email our email is technically a string so there is a builtin index method we will find the index of our at symbol this method will return a number we will create two new variables username as well as domain username equals our email we will use the indexing operator then place a colon so where do we begin and end with the username well with python we don't need to specify the beginning of a string you could say zero but we can omit that but we do need an ending index and that would be our index variable with our domain we can take the other half of our email email index of operator where do we begin and end well we will begin where we left off index index by itself isn't going to work as you would think and I'll demonstrate why then let's print using an F string your username is our placeholder username and domain is our domain variable okay let's test this and to your email bro1 123@gmail.com feel free to use your own email your user name is bro1 123 and domain is gmail.com I would like to Omit this at symbol at the beginning of my domain what we'll do when we assign our domain variable is set the beginning index to index + 1 then we will start after the at symbol so bro 1 2 3 at gmail.com yeah here we go your username is bro 123 and domain is gmail.com if you would like to take less lines of code here's how let's copy this index function delete our index variable replace index with that function so let's test this with a new email bro blah blah blah blah 1 2 3 4 5 6@gmail.com that's a very long username and domain is gmail.com this style would work as well however it's less readable but it does take less lines of code so it's up to you how you'd like to write this it's personal preference but yeah I thought that'd be a nice exercise now that we know how string indexing works and like I said I forgot to include this exercise at the end of that string indexing video but a separate video on this topic wouldn't be bad either but uh yeah everybody that is a email slice placing program in Python why hello everybody in today's video we'll be creating a compound interest calculator in Python for those that don't know interest is a charge for the privilege of borrowing money to some individual or organization when you place money in a bank account you typically acre interest we'll create a program to tell you what your new balance will be after acre interest for so many years but the user is going to decide the initial principle that's the investment the rate of interest and the time and years that this balance has been acing interest so let's begin let's declare three variables a principal a rate that is rate of interest and time time will be in years we've recently learned about while Loops I would like to include those within this program just so we get the hang of using them we will ask the user to type in an initial principal investment we will continue to prompt the user to type in a principal that's above zero our condition will be while principal is less than or equal to zero we will take our principal assign it some user input enter the principal amount then we would like to typ cast our input as a floating Point number if our user input principal is less than or equal to zero we need to inform the user principle can't be less than or equal to zero so I'm going to test my program by printing the principle at the end just temporarily enter the principal amount I can't type A negative number and continue what if my investment was $1,000 principal can't be less than or equal to zero how about zero nope can't do that either is 1,000 okay yep 1,000 works that is for the principle let's copy this while loop paste it replace principle with rate this is the rate of interest enter the interest rate interest rate can't be less than or equal to zero and let's copy this again paste it change rate to time let's typ cast our input as an integer because we're working with whole years enter the time in years time can be less than or equal to zero I'm going to print my principal rate and time we have principle rate time okay we know that principle Works enter the interest rate can my interest rate be negative 1 no it can't can it be zero nope how about 10 10% all right that works time can time be zero no it can't can my time be negative 1 no it can't what about 3 years all right so we know that our while Loops are working now here's the formula to calculate in interest let's say our total that's our total balance equals our principal times 1 + our rate / 100 I'm going to enclose this function with the set of parentheses this portion of our function will take our interest rate which is a whole number then create a decimal enclose this function within the power function raise this function to the power of time and that is how to calculate compound interest then we will print the New Balance I'll use an FST string balance after our variable time the word years I'll add a placeholder we will add our total then I'll include a dollar sign maybe this will be in dollars but pick any unit of currency you would like I will format this variable with the format specifier we will display two decimal places 2f okay let's try this enter the principal amount I invest $11,000 into maybe the stock market the interest rate is maybe 10% this year the time in years will be one so after one year at 10% interest my new balance is $1,100 let's try it one more time for good measure maybe $500 with an interest rate of seven over two years your new balance would be $572 45 all right now there is another way of writing this program what if we would like to allow the user to enter in values that are equal to zero while principal is less than zero if principal is less than zero principal can't be less than zero let's do that for rate interest can't be less than zero time time can't be less than zero here's what happens to our program remember that we're declaring our variables at the top uh nothing happens we go straight to the results so the reason that this is happening is that when we reach the while Loops this condition is false from the beginning we never end up entering these while Loops we skip over them because because these three conditions are all false we can write a different variation of this while loop where we could say while true true is a Boolean that means this while loop will continue forever unless we explicitly break out of the while loop we're going to add an else Clause else we will break break will break out of a loop with our second while loop change rate is less than zero to while true true then we will add an else Clause else break out of the loop while true else break out of the loop we should be able to enter zero values in now enter the principal amount 0 0 0 balance after 0 years is 0 this should work the same as before but we should be allowed to enter in 0 values $1,000 interest rate of zero after one year is still $1,000 well okay then everybody I thought that would be an interesting project to create now that we know how while loops work you could write either a standard while loop with a condition such as principal is less than or equal to zero or you could say while true this Loop would continue forever you would need to explicitly break out of the while loop using this break keyword which we'll cover again in four Loops but yeah that is a compound interest calculator in Python what is going on everybody in today's topic we're going to be creating a countdown timer in Python we'll be using what we learned in the previous topics let's begin we'll need to import the time module there's a pretty cool function within the time module that is the sleep function type time do sleep add a set of print es within the set of parentheses our program will essentially sleep for a given amount of seconds like three after 3 seconds let's print something this is just a demonstration times up when I execute this code nothing happens for 3 seconds but after 3 seconds passes it displays our message times up so you can use the sleep function of the time module to sleep for a given amount of time we will ask the user how long would they like to set the timer for we will create a variable let's say my time my time will be in seconds we will create a prompt enter the time in seconds then we should typ cast our input as an integer we'll need to create a loop we could use either a while loop or a four Loop there's a lot of overlap where you could use either one I'll use a four Loop in this case four we'll need some sort of counter X in our range zero through my time after each iteration we will sleep for 1 second Let's test what we have so far I would like to sleep for 3 seconds I think that's approximately three but now we are going to print whatever X is print x x is our counter 0 1 2 times up we're getting somewhere but I would like to count backwards what we could do is enclose our range function within the reverse function but another technique that we can use is by using a step let's replace zero with my time then end at zero but we will set the step to be NE -1 then we can increment backwards using this function that's another technique too to count backwards so let's wait for 3 seconds 3 2 1 times up now let's display a digital clock of some sort but we would have to calculate how many hours minutes and seconds there are so let's calculate seconds seconds equals x x is our counter remember modulus 60 within our print statement we'll use an F string we are displaying hours minutes and seconds I'll add some placeholders for each of these fields we have seconds with our digital clock we can't go above 60 for either seconds or minutes that's why I'm using modulus 60 the modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division let's begin at 11 so 11 10 n so it is counting down but I would like to add some zero padding and we can do that with a format specifier after seconds I will add colon I need to display two digits then zero pad those digits let's try that again I will wait for 11 seconds 11 10 9 yeah and we do have some zero padding so that's looking more and more like a digital clock let's add minutes then so to calculate minutes let's assign variable minutes equal to x / 60 because there's 60 seconds within a minute but then I'm going to typ cast the result as an integer modulus 60 we would not like this field of minutes to go above 60 60 so let's add a placeholder we're displaying minutes format specifier 02 now I'm going to wait for 65 seconds that is 1 minute and 5 Seconds then I just want to be sure that we go below a minute yep it's working then let's calculate hours oh by the way to stop your program from running hit this red square up in the corner let's calculate hours hours equal x / 3,600 there's 3,600 seconds in an hour then we will typ cast the result as an integer within our FST string we will display ours format specifier 02 then I will run this program let's wait for 3,65 seconds that is 1 hour and 5 Seconds and I just want to be sure that we go below 1 hour yeah all right so that works so the reason that I didn't add modulus 24 I don't have days within my FST string we can display any amount of hours I will exclude modulus 24 all right everybody well I thought that'd be some good practice with working with loops we should try and do as many exercises as we can and yeah that is a countdown timer program in Python hello everybody today we will be creating a shopping cart program this program will be an exercise to follow the previous lesson on lists sets and tles the more that we practice with those collections the better we'll be at using them so I thought we'd create an exercise to get the hang of it before moving on in this program we will have two lists Foods these lists will be empty we'll declare them but not use them quite yet and prices then a total total equals zero the reason that I'm not using tupples is that topples are unchangeable we're going to ask a user what food they would like to buy we can't depend any elements to a tupple we're not using sets because sets are unordered I mean I guess technically you could but at the end of this program I'm going to print our shopping cart in order so I think lists would probably be the best we have an empty list of foods and an empty list of prices we'll use a while loop while true if our condition is set to True we'll need some way to break out of the while loop we'll need a break statement somewhere we'll get to that later we will ask the user what food would they like to buy let's declare variable food equal to input enter a food to buy to exit the while loop Loop you need to press q q to quit then let's check if food is equal to Q lowercase Q then we will break we're not done with the program but let's at least test it Pizza hamburger hot dog Q to quit okay it looks like it works now what if somebody types in uppercase q Pizza hamburger uppercase q well we can't actually quit after accepting our user input if food. lower method this will take our input make it lowercase just for a comparison let's try that again Pizza hamburger I'll type capital Q to quit and that is valid follow food with the lower method to temporarily make the user input lowercase just in case they type in capital Q if the user doesn't want to quit let's add an else statement else let's take our Foods use the append method then add whatever food the user typed in we'll also need a price let's ask a user for the price price equals input enter the price of let's use an F string a whatever food the user types in pick a unit of currency I'll pick dollars we are working with numbers we should typ cast our input as a floating Point number since we're working with prices so we will accept a price add our food item to our list of foods do the same with prices prices. append whatever the price was and that is the wild Loop Let's test this program again to be sure that everything's working pizza pizza will be $55.99 enter a food to buy Hamburger hamburgers will be 350 hot dog hot dogs will be 175 I would like to quit I will type either capital Q or low case queue both will work and we have escaped the while loop so the while loop is now complete outside of the while loop let's display our shopping cart let's print some decorative text maybe five dashes your cart then another five dashes I will then iterate over all of the elements found within my Foods list for every food in my list of foods let's print each food item let's take a look so far again we have a pizza the price was $5.99 hamburger the price was 350 hot dog 175 CU to quit Okay your cart that will display the individual list items if you would rather have these list items arranged horizontally in one line you can add this keyword end equals this end keyword will replace the new line character at the end of a print statement with some other character like a space let's try that again I'll try not to take too much time Pizza 599 hamburger 350 hot dog 175 Q to quit yeah that's much better we are horizontally listing all of the different items within our list you could revert back to the vertical list if you'd prefer that I'll keep my output like this then we will need to iterate and add up all the prices for every price in prices we do have a total variable that we declared let's utilize that total equals total plus price otherwise we could shorten this to plus equals price that would do the same same thing then we will display the total print I'll use an F string your total is I'll add a unit of currency I picked the dollar sign whatever the total is okay let's run this program One Last Time enter a food to buy pizza which was $5.99 hamburger which was 350 hot dogs they are 175 C to quit here's your shopping cart I'm just going to add one new line real quick right before we display the total just an empty print statement here are the results your cart Pizza hamburger hot dog your total is $11.24 all right everybody well that is a shopping cart program I thought this would be a fun exercise to follow the previous lesson on lists sets and tles and well yeah that is a shopping cart program in Python hello again everybody so today we're going to create a quiz game in Python let's declare all of the different Collections and variables that we'll need first we will need a tuple of questions a 2d tle of options my quiz will have five questions but you can add more or less questions then a tuple of answers a list of guesses we will be appending guesses to our list that's why we're using a list rather than a tuple a score variable which I will set to be zero then question number this variable will keep track of what number question we're on all right let's begin with our questions I have five here are my questions they're all science related feel free to choose your own this is what I have how many elements are in the periodic table which animal lays the largest eggs what is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere how many bones are in the human body which planet in the solar system is the hottest these are the questions but we'll need options let's add four options for every question that's why we're using a two-dimensional tupple each inner Tuple will consist of four elements they will be options A B C or D let's copy these elements then paste them within each Tuple this first element corresponds to my first question how many elements are in the periodic table I'll come up with some answers I'll add some answers for the rest of these tles too we have a coule of correct answers the orders are c d a a b if you come up with your own options your answers may be different now that we have all of our different Collections and variables taken care of care of let's display each question I will iterate over our Tuple of questions they are iterable for every question in questions I'm going to print some decorative text I think that's probably good then I will print each question we're iterating over so let's see what we have so far there's all five questions after we display every question I need to display every option for every option in options our options options is a 2d tupple let's add the index operator the index is going to be our question number variable it's a number so at first we're accessing options at index of zero then 1 2 3 4 5 we will print every option in options at a given row number let's test this okay we have some options but all of these options are for the first question we will need to increment our question number so let's do that maybe here question number plus equals 1 that is much better before iterating the question number we will ask the user for a guess guess equals input enter a b c d in case the user types in something that's lowercase I will follow this input with the upper method to make the user input uppercase we will take our list of guesses use the append method add our guess to that list if our guess is equal to the aners tupple at index of question number that means the user guesss the right answer let's increase the user score score plus equals 1 then print the word correct correct else we will print incorrect I'll use an FST string our answers at index of question number is the correct answer all right let's answer some of these questions C correct which animal lays the largest eggs um definitely the whale because the whale is the largest creature right incorrect D is the correct answer what is the most abundant gas in Earth's atmosphere nitrogen correct how many bones are in the human body D that is incorrect A is the right answer which planet in the solar system is the hottest Mercury because it's closest to the Sun right wrong incorrect B is the correct answer we're keeping track of our anwers successfully once we complete all the questions let's print the results I'm going to add some decorative text not necessary but I think it would look cool I will display the results we will iterate over all of the answers and the guesses print answers I'm going to set the ending character to be an empty string for every answer in answers print each answer I will set the ending character to be a space to separate each answer then I'll add a new print line let's do this with guesses change answers to guesses for every guess in guesses print each guess okay I'm going to run this again I'm just going to make up some answers a b c d a here are the correct answers here are the guesses I guess none of them right then we print a score score equals take our score divided by I'm going to use the length function then pass in our questions how many elements are within our questions tble then I will multiply all of this by 100 to give us a percentage then typ cast this whole formula as an integer so we're basically just reassigning our score variable then let's print using an F string your score is our score variable then add percent I'm going to intentionally get all the answers right c d a a b here are the answers here are your guesses your score is 100% this time I'll try and get a few incorrect intentionally c c c c c your score is 20% all right everybody well that is a quiz game feel free to add more or less questions or come up with your own questions and that is a quiz game written in Python hey everybody today we will be creating a program to mimic a concession stand much like what you would see at a movie theater we will be utilizing a dictionary to keep track of a menu item and an Associated price more or less this is just a program to help us get used to working with dictionaries let's begin we'll create a dictionary named menu what items are on the menu we'll need an item and a price I'll think of some I'm going to speed up this video feel free to pause if you need more time and here's my menu everybody I thought of a few food items you might find at a movie theater concession stand pizza nachos popcorn fries chips soft pretzels soda lemonade movie theater popcorn is really expensive for some reason okay we have our menu a user is going to select specific keys from this menu depending on what the key is we can get the associated value to calculate a total to keep track of the user selected items I will create an empty list named cart I will also declare a variable named total to keep track of the total we need to lay this dictionary down flat to display it to a user well we do have the items method of a dictionary which we covered in the last video for every key value in our dictionary menu do items method the items method of our dictionary will return a key and a value during each iteration I'm simply going to print every key and value I'll use an F string I will print every key colon space then a value let's take a look so far here's our menu I'll make a few changes the price will be in dollar and cents but feel free to pick your own unit of currency I'll preedee my value with the dollar sign then using a format specifier I will display two decimal places 2f that's better I will line up all the keys after the key I will add a format specifier then allocate 10 spaces yeah look at that it's all lined up now before and after displaying our menu with this for loop I will add some decorative text let's say menu then outside of the for Loop I'll display a bunch of dashes yeah look at that let's move on to the next step we will ask a user for some input what item would they like to buy from the menu while our condition will be true if our condition is set to True we'll need to break out of this Loop one way or another we will ask for some user input food equals input select an item Q2 quit if food is equal to a lowercase Q then we will break Let's test it select an item pizza nachos soda Q to quit yeah it works okay what if the user types in capital Q well we can't escape the while loop if the user types in capital Q we're assuming that they would like to quit when we accept our user input I'm going to add do lower method this will take our user input and make it all lowercase so we should be able to acknowledge any uppercase letters yeah it works cool let's add an LF statement what if a user types in an item that's not on our menu well there is a get method of dictionaries if menu. getet pass in our food which is user input if the user selection is not within our menu as a key it will return none so we can use that else if menu. get food is not none then we would like to append that food item to our cart cart. append our food item so outside of the while loop I'm going to print our cart temporarily just to test it okay select an item Pizza soda pretzel how about a potato Q to quit we have our pizza soda and pretzel but not our potato we don't want that in our cart because that's not on the menu yeah you can just add that line else if menu item. getet food is not none that will complete our wild Loop let's calculate a total for every food in our cart let's take our total variable set this equal to Total plus then we need a value associated with a key plus menu. getet method get the food item found within our cart but I'm going to shorten this to Total plus equals menu. get the value associated with this food in our cart I will also display that food item print food I'm going to avoid printing our food item on every line I will set the ending character in our print statement just to be a space okay let's see what we have so far I would like popcorn soda pretzel Q quit popcorn soda pretzel then we will display the total I will print a new line print I'll use an FST string total is add a unit of currency total I'll add a format specifier point 2f to display two decimal places I'm going to add one line of decorative text let's copy maybe this all right let's test it out select an item popcorn pretzel soda potato CU a quit all right here's our cart popcorn pretzel soda we did not include the potato that was not found within our dictionary the total is $1250 well there you have it everybody that is a concession stand program the point of this program was to help us get used to working with dictionaries a dictionary is a collection of key value pairs such as an item and a price and yeah that's a concession stand program in Python hey everybody so today we're going to create a number guess game using python this is a project meant for beginners by completing this project it will help us reinforce our understanding of previous topics let's begin we will import the random module we'll need to pick a random number the random module is going to handle that for us what is the rrange of random numbers for our number guessing game we'll store those as variables we will have one variable named lowest number I'll set that to be one as well as is a variable for highest number which I will set to be 100 feel free to pick a different range if you would like I'll set the range to be 1 through 100 a random number will be selected between this range which will be stored within a variable named answer what is the correct answer so to choose a random number between these two values we will access the random module called the Rand int method we will choose a random integer between these two values the two arguments will be lowest num comma highest num for the second argument let's perform a test run I will print my answer the number is going to be between 1 and 100 okay we know that that works here's a few more variables we need to keep track of the number of wrong guesses which I will store as a variable named guesses we want the user to keep guessing as long as our application is running we will create a Boolean variable of is running which we will set to be true once the user wins the game we will set is running to be false we will print a welcome message let's say python number guessing game we will prompt the user I'll use an FST string select a number between I'll add two placeholders select a number between our lowest number and our highest number python number guessing game select number between 1 and 100 now if I was to change the range of these variables that should be reflected temporarily I changed the lowest number to be 10 and the highest number to be 1,000 but let's set that back between 1 and 100 is good we'll need a while loop to continue the game each round we will say while is running since is running is a Boolean we don't need to say while is running equals true we can just say while is running while this value remains true continue playing the game we will ask the user for some input we will create a local variable of guess guess equals use the input function then enter a prompt enter your guess there's one thing we want to check python number guessing game select a number between 1 and 100 enter your guess what if somebody doesn't type in a number like they type in the word Pizza we should let the user know that that's an invalid guess we'll write the following if statement if our guest use the is digit method if our guess is a digit a number then we will execute any code underneath this if statement for the time being I'll write pass we'll get back to that later else we will do something else let's print the following print invalid guess let's copy this print statement because I'm lazy and I don't feel like typing it out please select unn number between our lowest number and our highest number let's let's try that again I will guess Pizza which isn't a number and we get the message invalid guess please select a number between 1 and 100 all right that works underneath our if statement we'll write the following once we get a guess that is a digit we need to convert it to a number because when you accept user input it's a string we will reassign Our Guest equal to type cast our guess as an integer then increase the number of guesses by one guesses plus equals 1 because we have already made one guess here's another scenario what if somebody guesses a number outside of this range like one kajillion well we should give a warning that that guess is invalid if our guess is lower than the lowest number or our guess is greater than the highest number we will print the following that number is out of range and I will reprompt the user please select a number between the lowest number and the highest number let's perform a test run I will guess one kajillion that number is out of range please select a number between 1 and 100 We'll add an elseif statement else if our guess is less than our answer we will print the following too low try again else if our guess is greater than our answer we will print to high try again if our guess isn't less than our answer and our guess isn't greater than our answer that means we must have the correct answer within an else statement we will print I'll use an F string correct the answer was insert our answer our answer variable then print the number of guesses it took number of guesses add a placeholder place in our guesses within the placeholder now to escape the while loop we will take our Boolean variable of is running which is normally true and set that to be false to escape and that should be all we need let's run this one last time python number guessing game select a number between 1 and 100 let's select a number right in the middle 50 too low try again so the number is between 50 and 100 75 too high it's between 50 and 75 then 62 too high 56 53 55 correct the answer was 55 number of guesses it took me six all right everybody that is a python number guessing game you yourself can create as a mini project hey everybody in today's topic I thought we would create a game of rock paper scissors now that we know how the random module Works let's begin by importing the random module we will create some options we will use a tupple we're not going to be changing the options so a tupple would be better than a list we have three options rock paper or scissors I'll create a variable named player to store the Player's Choice for now I'm going to set this to be none as well as a computer our computer is going to pick a random Choice from these options rock paper or scissors in order to do so we can use the choice method of the random module random. choice pick a random Choice from options let's have the player enter in some input enter a choice rock paper scissors then we will display the Player's Choice and the computer's Choice I'll use an FST string player colon space the variable player let's copy that paste it then change player to computer let's see what we have so far enter a choice rock paper scissors so I pi pick Rock the computer pick scissors let's try it again just for good measure I pick paper this time the computer picks scissors I pick scissors the computer picks paper okay we know that the computer is successfully picking a random Choice from our options now what if the player picks something that's not within this Tuple such as the gun well we would want to stop that right we need the user to pick a valid option only rock paper or scissors I think what we'll do is that when we accept the user input let's place it within a while loop so indent this line while this condition is going to be kind of weird while our player variable is not in our Tuple options let's try this again to see what happens I pick the gun enter a choice all right well if I can't pick a gun how about a sponge well I can't pick that either rock that works our condition is while the player variable is not found within our options if the player doesn't pick one of these options this while loop will continue forever once we pick something that's within our options we then escape the wild Loop let's check some win conditions now if the player is equal to computer that means it's a tie I will print it's a tie I'll add a few else if statements else if the player is equal to rock I'll use the and logical operator and the computer is equal to scissors that means you win let's print you win let's add another condition else if the player picks paper and the computer picks Rock then you also win you win else if the player picks scissors and the computer and the computer picks paper then we will will print you win else if the Player's Choice is not the same as the computers and we don't meet any win conditions that must mean we lose print you lose let's see if this works enter a choice rock paper scissors I pick the gun nope I can't pick that I pick Rock I pick Rock the computer picks scissors you win let me see if I can lose I'll pick paper you win again scissors I need to stop winning I need to see if the lose condition works okay it's a tie at least but I need to lose all right there we go I pick Rock the computer picks paper you lose what if the user would like to play again let's place all of this code within a wild Loop let's do so right about here now I'm not going to write while true like I normally do this time I'm going to create a variable let's say running is our game running I will set that to be true while running equals true or we could shorten this to just while running that's simpler I will place all of this code within the wild Loop to mass indent some code just highlight all of the code then press tab hey everybody this is bro from the future I forgot to explain something the reason I'm not setting the condition of my while loop to be true is that if you have a lot of code within a while loop it can be really difficult to find where the Brak statement is if I set my condition to be a Boolean variable such as running it's a lot easier to find any instance where I use this variable if I were to highlight it we can see that running is found down here if I need to change any instance of this variable and rename it to something you can refactor let's rename running as maybe playing then I will refactor so my variable running is now playing and that change was made down here too so it's a coding preference every time we start a new game I will reset the player as well as the computer let's move these two lines into the wild loop at the beginning so when we start a new game we will reset the player the computer will pick a new random choice so let's see what we have so far Rock I pick Rock the computer picks Rock it's a tie then we have to play again so paper you lose scissors it's a tie now what if we would like to escape the while loop after our win conditions I'm going to create a temporary variable let's name this play again then we will ask for some user input play again question mark y/n meaning yes or no if the user types in something that's capital I'm going to use the lower method to make it lowercase so if our play again variable is equal to Y we would like to escape what I would like to do is I would like to see if the player types in something that's not y I will preedee this condition with the not logical operator if the user does not want to play again then let's take our Boolean variable running normally it's true and set that to be false running equals false that means we will escape the while loop once we escape the while loop I will print thanks for playing now I'm going to change this momentarily I just want to test it right play again yes paper play again yes scissors you lose play again nope thanks for playing this is entirely optional I try and create as few variables as possible I would personally rather avoid creating a variable here another way in which I could write this is that I can get rid of this variable let's move move if not in front of the input and follow our input here then use the comparison operator and add a colon if the user's input after making it lower case does not equal a y for yes set running to be false so that should work the same Rock play again yes enter a choice paper play again no thanks for playing this line would work the same but it's a little more complex for beginners to read or you can use the other method that I showed you all right everybody well that's a game of rock paper scissors hello everybody today we will be creating a dice roller program in Python we will be utilizing some aski art I'll post all of the aski art that we'll need in the description of this video you can copy and paste it to save time if you'd like all right let's get started everybody we will Begin by importing the random module because we will be rolling some random numbers between 1 through six if we're going to create some aski art we'll be utilizing Unicode characters to enter in a Unicode character it really varies depending on your operating system I think the easiest way would just be to use Python to enter a Unicode character type a forward slash then a given code for each character here are all of the codes that we'll need after writing these seven Unicode characters let's run this program these symbols that are output let's copy them I'll add them to a comment then we can delete this line these are the Unicode characters we'll need to build some masy art some dice each die will be made out of five lines let's begin with the first we'll need a left corner nine dashes then the right corner for the second line copy this vertical bar add nine spaces then a vertical bar we can copy this whole line paste it two times let's use the left bottom corner add a nine of these dashes then the bottom right corner and here's a basic box shape depending on what the number die is we can add one of these bullet points for a one we can add that right to the middle so that's good for now we'll delete this later let's create a dictionary I will name this dictionary dice art our dictionary is made out of key value pairs so the keys will be the numbers 1- 6 beginning with one the value will be a tle it's a dictionary made out of key value pairs where the value is a tupple within the tupple let's add these lines each separated with the comma I'm going to format these so they form a box shape let's take our bullet point place it right in the middle then add a comma to the end of this key value pair that is the first key value pair let's copy all of this paste it again change one to two let's move this bullet point we need two bullet points about right here and here let's repeat this process for Keys 3 through six be sure to get rid of the comma at the end and here is our dictionary of dice art each key is a number each value is a tupple made of strings let's create a list of dice our dice will be numbers randomly generated between 1 and six a total to calculate the total I'll set that to be zero then we will ask a user for a number of dice this will be some input how many dice then typ cast the input as an integer we don't want somebody to write you know 2.5 di you can't roll half a die to generate a random number you can use the Rand int method of the random module we need a random number between 1 and six then we need to append this number to our list of dice dice. append then we can move this line to within the append method we need to do this a number of times depending on how many dice the user enters in we can place this line within a for Loop for every die in our range number of dice this will be a number let's print our list of dice to see what numbers we have in here how many dice I would like five dice 5 3 3 4 6 okay we we know that that works let's calculate a total we'll need to iterate and sum all of the elements within our list we can do that with the for Loop for every die in our list dice take our total variable plus equals the current value within our dice then we will print a total I'll use an F string total colon space our total variable let's see what we have so far how many dice I would like five dice our total is 19 now between these two for Loops we will display our aski art the easiest way would be to create some nested for Loops the outer for Loop will be in charge of the number of dice for every die in our range number of dice the inner for Loop will be in charge of printing every tupple for every line in then to get a value in our dictionary we would type the name of the dictionary dice art then use the get method what are we getting we're getting a value at a given key let's take our list of of numbers dice at index of D our counter depending on what the user types in for the number of dice die will begin at one then increment within the inner four Loop we will print the line so let's take a look how many dice I would like three Dice and here's our asky art 6 + 2 + 4 that equals 12 if you would prefer we can display all of these dice on a single horizontal line instead of one vertical line it's a little more tricky though if you would prefer that approach let's turn this chunk of code into comments we will write this nested Loop a little different so each tupple is made up of five elements right so if we're printing a horizontal line let's say we roll the numbers 1 through three we would first need to display this line of the first dice then the first line of the second dice then the first line of the third dice during the next iteration of the outer loop we would display the second line of the first dice the second line of the second dice the second line of the third dice so it's a little more complex let's create an outer loop that will iterate five times for every line in range five then the nested Loop will be for every die in dice how many dice do we have within our list we will print we're going to get one of the values found at one of the numbers that we roll take our dictionary of dice art. getet then a number 1 through six that will be the value found within our list of dice get the current die remember that this is a number 1 through six we would then need one of the elements found within our Tuple so get the first line then the second line third fourth fifth so let's add the index operator place our counter of line within the index operator let's see what we have so far we need to add one more thing how many dice three this is an Abomination there's one more change we need to make at the end of our print statement let's set the ending character to be an empty string and that should fix that how many dice three okay we're getting better results then when we escape the inner loop we will print a new line how many dice three and there we are 3 + 6 + 1 is 10 all right everybody so that is a dice roller program it is kind of complex but I thought this might be a good exercise if you would like a copy of this code I will post all of this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a dice roller program in Python hello everybody today I'm going to show you how we can write a substitution Cipher encryption program basically speaking what we're going to do is that we have a message to hide the message we can encrypt it by replacing every instance of one character with another chosen at random using the same key we can then decrypt the message when I was at my University I took an intro to cyber security course I turned this program in as a final assignment and I did get an A on it I don't know maybe it'll help you at the very least it's a good exercise all right let's get started everybody we will begin by importing the random module as well as the string module let's create a string of characters named chars whatever characters you would like to use for your encryption program list them here as a string however this can be a lot to write I think a better solution would be to import some constants from the string module I'm going to include some punctuation I will import the punctuation constant of the string module how the heck do you spell punctuation okay that's right plus I will add some digits string do digits constant plus string dot aski letters let's take a look at our character so far we have one long string of characters what if I would like to include a space a white space well there is a constant for that but that includes things like carriage return that's going to warp our results let me show you just for a demonstration string. whitespace plus all the other stuff we have a carriage return and some other characters I would like to avoid that so in place of importing the white space constant from the string module I'm going to add a space character that's good enough enough here are all the characters I will be using this program feel free to add more or less this is all one long string I'm going to turn the string into a list where each character is an individual element to do that I'm going to take our string of chars reassign it then typ cast my string of characters as a list then let's print it again print chars instead of one long string we have a list a list of all the characters we'll need I am then going to create a key which we will Shuffle eventually key then to create a copy of a list you can type the original list do copy method then I will print my key I'm going to place these lists within an F string chars then key let's see what we have we have two identical lists one for the original characters and the other for the key we're going to shuffle this key random. shuffle pass in our list of keys look at that all of the characters are now shuffled in a random order what we'll be doing when somebody types in some text to be encrypted we will replace every instance of one character within that string let's say an O then replace it with another one every time we run this program this key will be reshuffled let's ask for some user input this part of our program we will do some encryption plain text is the original message plain text equals we will accept some user input enter a message to encrypt Cypher text is the name of the encrypted message that will be an empty string okay let's say user types in a message enter message to encrypt I like pizza it's a very important message every instance of a character within my plain text I will refer to the key and replace that letter with a different one for example any z's I have two Z's in this program will be replaced with let's see capital B every time we run this program though it's going to shuffle the key so it's not going to be consistent what we're going to be doing is iterating over every letter in our plain text for every letter in plain text strings are iterable find the index of every letter from our plain text within our list of characters let's assign a variable index index equals take our list of chars use the index method we are looking for that letter whatever letter we're currently on then return an index then refer to our our key get whatever letter is at that same index so we will append that to our Cipher text it's currently an empty string Cypher text plus equals our key at the given index our Cipher text should be the encrypted message now let's print it out print I'll use an FST string original message let's print our plain text then our encrypted message print our cyppher text string let's take a look so far enter a message to encrypt I like pizza then here's the new encrypted message every instance of a character within my plan text was replaced with another so for example any z's were replaced with E I have two e within this encrypted message if I were to run this program again it would likely be different I like pizza and here's my new encrypted message my Z's were replaced with semicolons this time for every letter in our plain text get the index of each letter then refer to the key add the new character to our encrypted message it's probably best for us not to display the characters and the key so let's hide those we will be reusing this key for decryption now to decrypt the message let's copy this section of code paste it we are now decrypting we will ask for some Cipher text then reset our plain text for every letter in our Cipher text refer to our key append a character to our plain text within our list chars at a given index we will display our encrypted message followed by the original message let's try it one last time enter a message to encrypt I like tacos here's my original message then the encrypted message if I were to decrypt the encrypted message it should give me my original message I will type in these characters exactly hit enter and here is my message decrypted I like tacos all right everybody so that is a substitution Cipher encryption program for beginners when I was at University I did turn this program in for a final assignment for a cyber security class and I did get an A on it so maybe it'll help you and well yeah that's an encryption program for beginners in Python hey everybody in today's topic we'll be creating a credit card validator program in Python it sounds intimidating but it's actually not that bad oh I almost forgot if you need a credit card number to work with you can always look online for test credit card account numbers I've listed the steps here after accepting some user input what we'll need to do is remove any dashes or spaces that the user may enter in to check if this number is valid we will add all digits in the odd places from right to left then we will double every second digit from right to left all of the even numbers basically if the digit doubled is now a two-digit number add the two-digit numbers together to get a single digit after doubling all your even digits add them together to create a sum of even numbers sum the totals of steps 2 and three if the sum is divisible by 10 the credit card number is valid we'll tackle this program step by step let's declare all of the variables we'll need throughout our program we'll need to hold the sum of all the odd digits from right to left I'll store that within a variable named sum odd digits I'll set that equal to be zero then we will sum the even digits I'll set that to be zero as well then I will declare a variable named total to store the total all right now let's begin with step one I'll just add a comment step one we will accept some user input we'll store that within a variable named card number equals input we'll ask the user to enter a credit card number we're not going to typ cast this number we will keep the user input as a string for now at least we'll need to remove any dashes we can do that by reassigning our card number equal to card number then use the built-in replace method of a string we will replace any dashes with an empty string just temporarily I'm going to print our card number just to be sure that we remove the dashes before continuing so enter a credit card number I'm just going to make up a number 1 2 34-56 78- 9012 D 3456 yep and all the dashes have been removed now if the user types in any spaces to separate each of the four digits let's remove those two we will reassign card number equal to card number use the built-in replace method replace any spaces with an empty string let's try this again I'll enter in my card number but separate each group of four digits with the space all of the spaces are gone now with the following steps we're going to be summing the digits from right to left I think the easiest way to do this is to reverse our string and that's fairly simple in Python we will take our card number reassign it equal to card number use the indexing operator there's going to be no beginning index or ending index but we will set the step to be netive -1 this will reverse our string and reassign it let's test it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 yeah and our string is now reversed so that completes step one we no longer need to print our card number we will move on to step two step two states that we need to add all dig digits in the odd places from right to left while a string is iterable we can use it within a for Loop for X in our card number we will need every second digit there's no beginning index or ending index but we will set the step to be two we will iterate over every second digit within our card number X will store each digit temporarily so we will take our variable sum odd digits equals Su odd digits plus X but we can simplify this to sum odd digits plus equal x there's one more thing we need to do for step two I'll demonstrate let's type in our credit card number I'm just making up a number again so we have an unsupported operand type we're iterating over a string X is technically a string we would want to typ Cast X as an integer let's try that again just to be sure everything works fine okay yeah there's no problems that will complete step two let's move on to step three step three states that we will double every second digit from right to left if the result is a two-digit number add the two-digit number together to get a single digit with the for Loop forx in our card number we will iterate over every second digit set the step to be two however we will begin at the second digit which has an index of One X will store the current digit let's reassign X to be x * 2 cuz we're doubling every second digit however we would need to typ Cast X as an integer because it's currently a string to see if x is a two-digit number we can easily use an if statement if x is greater than or equal to 10 if x is greater than or equal to 10 it should technically be a two-digit number right because 10 is a two-digit number so if x is a two-digit number we'll need to split that number then add them together let's take sum even digits plus equals x modulous 10 that would give you the remainder of any division then add one the largest that X can be in the scenario is 18 because the largest a single digit can be is nine in our credit card number so 9 * 2 is 18 18 modulus 10 would give us 8 we would split that number to get one and8 then add those two numbers together to get n so else X must be less than 10 if that's the case we would take some even digits plus equals whatever X is that completes step three let's move on to step four add together both the sum of the odd digits and sum of the even digits total equals some odd digits plus some even digits then step five step five if our total is divisible by 10 it's a valid number if total modulus 10 is equal to 0 then print valid else print invalid that should complete our program Let's test it enter a credit card number I'm just going to make up something so this is an invalid number for a valid number you can either use your own credit card if you have one or you could find a sample online I'll just use the first one that I find oh yeah that number is valid just for good measure I'll test another yep that one is also valid all right everybody I thought this would be a good project for us to work on it helps us get used to working with strings and Loops as well but yeah that is a credit card validator program in Python hey what's going on everybody so so in this video we're going to create a very simple banking program using python this is meant to be more of an exercise to get us used to working with functions when creating a project I like to divide that project into smaller sections then handle them one at a time so we'll do that by declaring all the functions we'll need first with the banking program we'll need to show a user their balance we'll Define a function to show balance for the time being I'll write pass just as a placeholder we'll need to make a deposit Define deposit make a withdrawal Define withdraw near the end of this project we will be creating a main function and placing the main body of our code within it we'll handle that near the end just to contain everything we have our three functions with our banking program we'll need to show a balance make a deposit or make a withdrawal what are some variables we'll need well we'll need a balance which I will set to be zero initially I will also create a Boolean of is running this will be true if at any time we said is running to be false we'll exit the program so with the majority of our code we'll place it within a while loop while is running you can check to see if this is equal to true but since this is a Boolean that's not necessary we will just say while is running if is running becomes false we'll exit the while loop within our while loop we'll print some sort of Welcome message let's print banking program then list some options let's print one show balance to deposit three will be withdraw four will be exit afterwards we will set a choice variable to equal some user input input enter your choice 1 through 4 we're encouraging a user to type in a number 1 through 4 to select an option do they want to show their balance make it AIT make a withdrawal or exit We'll add a few if and else if statements let's check to see if the user's choice is equal to one that is a string of one our user input is a string data type unless we were to typ cast it to something else if our choice is equal to one we will call the function to show bance bance else if our choice is equal to two we will make a deposit by calling the deposit function else if choice is equal to three we will call the withdrawal function else if choice is equal to 4 that means we would like to exit so we need to exit this while loop we can do that by setting our variable of is running is this program running equal to be false to exit if somebody types in some input that's not valid we can handle that with an lse statement else let's print that is not a valid Choice okay let's see what we're working with currently to test everything we haven't written anything within these functions yet show balance deposit or withdraw so we can type 1 2 3 and for to exit processed finished with exit Code Zero so we can exit the program we just have to select option four with this else statement this will execute if we type in something besides the numbers 1 through 4 because there's no other options left so to test that enter your choice 1 through 4 uh I'm just going to type the word poo that is not a valid choice so we know that the lse statement is working once we exit the while loop let's print a message that says thank you have a nice day if I was to type four to exit we should exit the program thank you have a nice day let's make that h capital now we'll work on our functions beginning with show balance currently these two variables are Global we don't need to pass them as a parameter to these functions quite yet we will be enclosing all of this code within a main function we'll handle that later though so with show balance all we're going to do is print I'll use an F string your balance is add a sign or other unit of currency of you're choosing add a placeholder our balance variable and let's see what we have I will type one to show balance your balance is $0 I'll display our balance with two decimal places after I will add a format specifier after balance colon. 2f will add two decimal places we covered format specifiers in a previous topic so if I were to run this again type one we show 0 and 0 C we're displaying two floating Point decimal places now we need to make a deposit that will be the next function we will Define a local variable of amount equals accept some user input enter an amount to be deposited again when we accept user input it's a string we'll typ cast it to a number a floating Point number because we have to include dollars and cents we'll add some checks though after accepting some user input if our amount is greater than zero we don't want anybody to make a negative deposit let's print that's not a valid amount else we are going to return our amount so this function is going to return something so within our else if statement we will take our balance plus equals the deposit we being returned with this will add our deposit to our balance balance plus equals deposit it let's try it let's show our balance our balance is $0 we'll make a deposit of $100 exactly again we'll show our balance after making the deposit your balance is $100 let's attempt to deposit negative money we'll select two to make a deposit we'll deposit $420 and 69 that's not a valid amount so we have a problem we have a type error unsupported operand for float and non type so within this statement within if within our deposit function we're not returning anything let's just return zero we have to return something and within this if statement we didn't return anything previously we'll either return zero or return a valid amount let's try this again let's make a deposit I will attempt to deposit 42069 that's not a valid amount our program's not crashing that's good now we'll attempt to make a valid deposit $501 then show my balance your balance is $501 okay that is the deposit function we'll work on the withdraw function next we will create a local variable of amount accept some user input enter amount to be withdrawn our user input is going to be a string we will typ cast it to be a floating Point number we need to check to see if our amount we're trying to withdraw is greater than our balance users shouldn't be able to withdraw more money than what they have in their bank account if the amount is greater than our balance that we have we will print insufficient funds else if the amount somebody's trying to withdraw is less than zero we will print a different message amount must be greater than zero else we will return our valid amount so with our if and else if statements we do need to return something if we take one of these routes we will return zero we're not making any changes within our else if statement where we select choice three we're going to take our balance minus equals the withdraw amount let's test this banking program let's show our balance our balance is zero we'll make a deposit of $100 show my balance again your balance is $100 let's press three to withdraw money enter amount to be withdrawn one1 kajillion dollar insufficient funds yeah no kidding Let's attempt to withdraw money again we shouldn't be able to select a negative amount 42069 amount must be greater than zero let's enter in valid number this time I would like to withdraw $49.99 that has appeared to work we'll show our balance again your balance is now $501 then we can exit by pressing four to exit thank you and have a nice day the last few changes I'm going to make is that I'm going to enclose all of this code our main portion of code within a main function just to encapsulate all of our variables and help with readability we will Define a function of main take all of our code within the main body of our pram program and place it within the function I'm just going to select all of it and indent it at the end of our program we need to call a main function to run it if you're familiar with the statement of if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main that means this program can be imported or run stand alone it is good practice to include this if statement we discussed this in the previous video if we're running this program directly execute the main function however are variables of balance and is running they're now enclosed within this local scope these other functions have no idea what these variables are of balance so we need to pass in our balance to those functions of withdraw and show balance when we show our balance we have to pass in our variable of balance same thing with withdraw then set up those parameters when then show balance we will have one parameter of balance the same thing with withdraw the last thing I'm going to do is add a little bit of text decoration around my program just to make it look nice so I will print a bunch of asterisks it's not necessary but I think it'll look nice let's add some text decoration before and after the title of banking program also before our choice basically whenever we print anything We'll add some text decoration let's do that with show balance our deposit and within withdraw okay let's run this one last time banking program let's show our balance your balance is $0 we'll make a deposit $100 And1 show our balance again your balance is $100 And1 we will withdraw money enter an amount to be withdrawn $11,000 insufficient funds let's try that again let's withdraw $50 show our balance again $501 then press for to exit thank you and have a nice day all right everybody that is a simple banking program you can write using python hey everybody in today's video we're going to create a beginners slot machine program using python this Project's meant for beginners so let's get started when creating a project I like to break up that project into different sections then tackle them one at a time so with the slot machine what are some of the different functions we'll need well we'll need to spin a row we'll Define a function to spin row as a placeholder I'll write pass we'll return to this function later we need to display or print row print row if somebody gets matching symbols on the slot machine we need to give them a payout we'll create a function to get payout in this function we'll calculate what that payout is going to be but again we'll get to that later we'll write the majority of our code within a main function at the end of this program I will add the if statement of if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main then we will call the main function which drives our code this program can be imported or stand alone it is good practice to add this if statement a majority of the code we're going to write is going to be within our main function So within our main function let's declare the variables we'll need throughout this program we will need a starting balance which I will just name balance we will start with 100 as in $100 we'll need to display some sort of Welcome message let's print something we will print welcome to Let's name our game python slots just for some flavor I'm going to add some text decoration just a bunch of asterisks I think it'll look cool but you don't have to Let's display our symbols we're going to use symbols I'll add some emojis we'll use emojis in this program in place of images if you're on Windows you can hold down the window key plus semicolon let's add a cherry you typically see a lot of fruit in slot machines a watermelon a lemon there's also a lot of bells for some reason but we'll add those and a star let me just align everything let's do a test run welcome to python slots let me make one adjustment okay I'm happy with that so after our welcome message we'll continue playing this game while our balance is greater than zero while we still have money we can continue playing we will print I'll use an FST string current balance col in space I'll add a placeholder pick a unit of currency I'll pick American dollars then we will display the users balance we will prompt the user to enter in their bet which we will assign to a variable of bet so input place your bet amount let's do a test run welcome to python slots current balance $1100 place your bet amount we won't deduce the BET amount from the balance quite yet I just want to be sure that we can enter in something $1 good $10 100 $ what if somebody types in a word like pizza we need to prevent that input and correct it we'll check if take our bet use the is digit method is our bet a digit if somebody types in a word like pizza we need to tell them that's not valid so this will return true if our bet is a digit but we're going to use the not logical operator if our bet is not a digit then do this we will print please enter a valid number followed by the continue keyword the continue keyword will skip the current iteration of this Loop and start from the beginning Let's test it place your bet amount pizza please enter a valid number we have our current balance again place your bet amount I'll type in one okay we did not get that message of please enter a valid number this bet of $1 is valid so if our bet is a digit we'll convert it to be an integer using typ casting because when you accept user input it's a string it has the string data type let's reassign our bet typ cast our bet as an integer then we will check to see if our bet is greater than our balance people can't bet money that they don't have if the bet is greater than the current balance if bet is greater than balance we will print this message instead insufficient funds then continue if somebody tries to bet negative money or no money we'll add this statement if bet is less than or equal to zero we will print bet must be greater than zero and continue if all these checks pass if our bet is not a digit if our bet is greater than our balance or if our bet is greater than zero we will take our original balance minus equals our bet to subtract it let's do a test run place your bet amount pizza please enter a valid number I will bet one1 kajillion dollars insufficient funds yeah no kidding 0 bet must be greater than zero what about $1 our bet should be subtracted from our balance let's try 10 we are now down to 89 let's bet $90 insufficient funds 89 and that has appeared to work once we subtract our bet from our balance we will call the function to spin row this function is going to return a list which we will assign to be row row will be a list using the spin row function we have to generate three random symbols then return them within a list we'll work on the spin row function next within our spin row function we will declare a list of symbols add your symbols but the these Need to Be Strings make sure they're all comma separated there we go this is where list comprehensions can come in if you don't know what a list comprehension is here's an alternative we will declare an empty list list of results this is an empty list we need a for Loop to generate three random symbols we could say for symbol in range three this for Loop will iterate three times during each iteration let's take our empty list of results use the append method we will append a random. choice among our symbols so we need to import the random module we'll do so at the top import random we're telling the random module to pick a random Choice from this list of symbols then we will append them to our empty list of results after we escape the for Loop we will return our results it's a list now a much better option is to use a list comprehension here's how it's going to be a lot more concise we will return a list within the list we will write a list comprehension for every let's say symbol in range three there is no condition what do we want to return during each iteration access the random module use the choice method then pass in our symbols symbol isn't used in this example what you may see people do is use an underscore as a placeholder basically what we're saying is for every iteration in range three return a random symbol that's all we need for the spin row function going back we have our list of row afterwards I am going to print it to test it print row and we should have three random symbols after making a bet all right it looks like it's working we'll make a few changes though instead of printing our row I'm going to print the word spinning I will add a new line character just to give us some space like after this word spinning then we will call the print row function we'll pass in one argument our row that's returned to us after we spin the row so going to our print row function we need to set up one parameter our row that we receive it's going to be a list one easy way to print the elements of a list is that we can print pick some sort of separator for each item in the list for example I'll just print a space with strings there are built-in methods we will use the join method then pass in our list or other iterable basically what we're saying using the join method we're going to take our iterable in this case our list join each element by a space a space character here's the result we have three symbols you could join them by a different character I'll add a vertical bar and to your bet amount $1 now we have a vertical bar between each of these symbols we could include more than one character I'll add a space before and after this vertical bar just to space things out I think that looks a lot better and you don't have to but I'm going to add some text decoration before and after I'll add a bunch of asterisks let's see what we're working with not bad so every time we make a bet we get a new set of symbols now what if all three symbols match we need to calculate a payout and give it to the user because well they won so after we print our row we will call the get payout function but we will pass in our row it's a list and our bet how much did we bet we will be returned with a payout which we will add to our balance let's go to the get payout function we're sending two arguments to our get payout function a row and a bet we have to check to see if each element in our row is all the same is it all the same character we can do that with an if statement if our row at index of zero that that's going to be the first symbol is equal to row at index one that's the second symbol is equal to row at the second index and that's the third symbol if all three symbols match we have to return the BET multiplied within our if statement we will add another if statement I will check to see if our row at index zero is equal to our first symbol of cherry be sure to place it within quotes because it's a string now the reason I'm only checking if row at index zero is a Cherry Emoji all these symbols are going to be the same if we're within this if statement all of these symbols are going to match we only need to check one of them it could be zero one or two but I'll just add zero they're all going to be the same regardless if somebody has all cherries we will return their bet time three or some other amount you can make the payouts higher or lower else if row at index zero is equal to a watermelon then we will return their bet Time 4 so watermelons are worth more than cherries else if row at index zero is equal to a lemon we will return their bet * 5 else if row at index zero is equal to a bell let's give them times 10 return bet time 10 else if row at index zero is equal to a star that's worth the most we will return their bet times 20 make sure we're not within our if statement anymore if all three symbols don't match within our list we don't want to give the user anything they lost that spin we will return zero that's all we need for the get payout function scrolling back down after receiving a payout it's returned to us from this function we'll check to see if our payout is greater than zero that means they want to spin I will print I'll use an F string you one I'll add a placeholder precede this with a unit of currency I'll use dollars we'll display the payout else if they did not receive a payout that means they lost that spin we will print sorry you lost this round then take our balance this is our original balance plus equals our payout in most cases the payout is going to be zero but if the user wins something we will add that to the balance okay let's do a test run I will bet $1 sorry you lost this round and my current balance is 99 let's bet again I'll just keep on doing this until I win we're going to lose more times than what we win okay see I got all Bells it says you won $10 once somebody runs out of money we want to stop them from playing or if they would like to exit we'll create a variable of play again we will accept some user input do you want to spin again we'll add y for yes sln for no if our variable of play again does not equal a character of capital Y then we will break to break out of this Loop let's do a test run enter your bet amount I'll just bet a dollar do you want to spin again if I type in anything besides a capital Y we will exit I will type in no then we exit and to your bet amount I'll bet a dollar if somebody were to type in a lowercase y that doesn't register we'll make it uppercase by following our input with the upper method to make it uppercase place your B a dollar hey I won I won $3 do you want to play again I'll type in a lowercase y yes I would like to play again but I did not hold shift in order to make this a capital Y that will still register and our current balance is $12 we're ahead currently place your bet amount I'll bet $10 we lost this round I will press n because I don't want to play again then we exit so at the end of our program I will print I'll use an FST string game over your final balance is I'll add a placeholder pick a unit of currency I'll pick dollars display our balance then I'll just add some text decoration before and after to make it all look nice okay let's play this one last time enter your bet amount I'll bet a dollar sorry you lost this round do you want to spin again yes I do I will bet $5 you lost spin again yes I will bet 10 20 again I'll bet 20 I keep losing I'm running out of money guys hey I won $10 though do you want to spin again no game over your final balance is $113 that's why you shouldn't gamble you tend to lose more money than what you gain all right everybody so that is a slot machine program you can write using python what's up everybody so in today's video we're going to create a game of hangman using python I thought that this would be a good mini project for us while learning to code it is important to create small projects as you go along here's one that we can make together when creating a project I like to declare the various variables and data structures I'll need first followed by the functions I'll need for this game we will need a set of words one of these words is going to be chosen at random so let's create a few words I'll add some fruit apple orange banana coconut and one more pineapple using the random module let's import that import import random using the random module we will pick one of these words at random we won't be able to see what it is but we can guess what the word is one letter at a time once we reach six incorrect guesses we lose the game before each guess we will display some asky art which I will name as hangman art this will be a dictionary a dictionary where each key value pair contains a tuple so this is a dictionary of we'll have a key which will be a number and a tuple the key is going to represent the incorrect number of guesses so we'll start at zero we will display a tupple which will contain some asky art then let me just copy this for one incorrect guess will display some different s art I'll just put each on a new line for readability so we're going to go all the way up to six once we hit six incorrect guesses we lose the game each key corresponds to the number of incorrect guesses once we reach six we lose the game each tupple that corresponds to the incorrect number of guesses we will display a certain image if you would like feel free to look in the description of this video if you would like to copy this to save you some time each topple will consist of three rows three strings for no incorrect guesses where incorrect guesses is zero we will display nothing we can't see our hangman person for one incorrect guess we will display their head for two incorrect guesses we will display their head and the main torso of their body which will represent with a vertical bar let me copy this one for three incorrect guesses we will display their left arm represented with the forward slash with four incorrect guesses we will display their right arm however if you use a backs slash that's an escape sequence within a string you have to use double backs slashes to literally print a backslash so with five incorrect guesses we will display their left leg of the person then once we reach six incorrect guesses we display the full person that's when we lose the game when we see the entire person that's some asky AR that we can use so let's test it just to be sure that everything is working fine I will print my hangman art at the Key of zero to represent present no incorrect guesses okay so when we display this person we're going to have to use some sort of loop for every let's say line in hangman art at index of zero for zero incorrect guesses I will print each line with no incorrect guesses we don't display anything that's correct we can't see the person and that's okay so with one incorrect guess display the dictionary where the key is one that displays the person's head two two would be the main torso of their body three their left arm four their right arm five their left leg and six their right leg once we see the entire person we lose the game so we can delete these two lines of code we no longer need them we know that our dictionary is working I'm going to zoom out a little bit following our dictionary we'll declare the various functions we'll need throughout this program we will Define a function to display man our hangman there will be one parameter wrong guesses and then for the time being I'll write pass we'll fill in this function later when we display our man we need to know the number of incorrect guesses to display the Right image we have a display man function and a display hint function we will have a string of hint then I'll write pass for now our hint is going to be a list a list of underscore characters for each letter that we guess right we'll flip one of those underscores to be a letter if that letter is correct I'll create a function of display answer within this function we will display the correct answer either when we lose the game or win the game and I will WR pass we will create a function of main to contain the main body of code of our program again I'll write pass for now I'll add the following if statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if we are running this file directly I would like to call the main function to start the program all right let me zoom out this will be the main skeletal structure of our program import the random module we have our set of words we'll be import recording more from a separate file near the end of this video we have a dictionary where the key is a number to represent the number of incorrect guesses and a tuple to display some asky art we have four functions display our man display the hint display the answer and the main function to contain the main body of code all right let's work within our main function within our main function we will create a variable of answer what is the correct answer that we have to guess I will access the random module call the method of choice then pass in our set of words one of these words will be chosen at random let's test that I will print our answer just temporarily we should get a random word apple apple pineapple Apple I guess it really likes apple for some reason there we go we have orange we are choosing a word at random we no longer need this print statement looks like everything is working fine now we'll display our hint our hint is going to be a list of underscore characters I need the number of underscore characters to equal the number of characters in one of these words that is chosen at random so I could multiply my list by the length using the length function of my answer so let's print our hint to see what we're working with with my selected word we have how many underscores 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 okay we have a different word 1 2 3 4 5 that is probably Apple it has five characters all right so that's our hint it's a list of underscore characters when we guess a letter if it's correct we fill in one of the underscores with that correct character we need to keep track of the number of wrong guesses we'll create a variable of wrong guesses set that equal to be zero when we start the game we're going to keep track of all of the incorrect guesses that we've made we will create a set of guest letters for an empty set we'll call the set function normally in Python you can't create an empty set with just a set of parentheses we have to use the set function then I will create a Boolean variable of is running set that to be true while our game is running continue playing once we lose or win the game we will switch this to be false to exit the game we will keep this as true when we initially run this program after we declare the variables we'll need within the main function we'll create a loop a while loop while is running we don't need to say while is running is equal to true we don't necessarily need to create that comparison we can just say while is running while this is true continue doing some code so what would we like to do let's call the function of display man but we have to pass in the wrong number of guesses call our function of display man pass in our variable of wrong guesses when we begin the game we would like to display one of these images then we will display our hint then we'll call the function to display our hint pass in our hint that was the list of underscore characters to represent the answer we have to guess we will create a variable of guess and accept some user input we'll prompt the user to enter a letter just in case a user types in a character that's uppercase let's add the lower method to make it lowercase so let's fill in our display man function there's not a lot to write here when we call this function we need to display one of these images based on the wrong number of guesses one of these Keys within the display man function we'll create a for Loop for every line in my hangman art this dictionary at the Key of wrong guesses this will be a number 0 through 6 depending on what this number is I will print each line print each line of that Tuple let's see what we're working with we'll do a test run so we are displaying no person we can't see them for testing purposes I'm going to change wrong guesses to be one we're displaying their head two displays their body three displays their left arm four is their right arm five their left leg and six is their full body that's when we lose now you don't necessarily need to do this but I'll add some text decoration before and after I'll add just a bunch of asterisks before and after I think that looks better but you do you let's be sure to set wrong guesses back to zero after we display our hangman we have to display the hint what's the clue we're trying to solve so we will call our display hint function and pass in our list of hint So within the display hint function let me zoom out I will print the following between each character within our hint each underscore we will display a space character strings have a built-in join method we'll call that then pass in our hint for each character within our hint join it by an empty space so now when we do a test run we are displaying an underscore to represent each character each is separated with the space while we're here we'll fill in the display answer function we just have to copy this line of code from display hint replace hint with answer and that's all we need for the display answer function so let me test that real quick after displaying our hint temporarily I will display our answer just to be sure that it's working yep there's our hint and there's our answer that we have to guess okay let's delete this line of code we don't want to display the answer I was just testing it so the user is going to be able to type in a letter to guess such as a for example once we guess a letter if that letter is found within the hint if it's one of these characters we need to switch that underscore to be one of those characters so we'll write the following if statement if our guess is in our answer in is a membership operator if this letter is found within our string of answer we're going to create a loop we will create a loop that will iterate once for each character within the answer but we don't know the length of the answer because python will choose it at random so let's say for every index we can shorten this to I for I in range the length of my answer let's say the word is Apple the length of the word Apple has five characters this would return five for I in range five then we will iterate five times we'll iterate this Loop once for the number of characters within my answer we'll check during each iteration if our answer at index of I during the first iteration that will be zero then the second iteration it will be one then two so on and so forth strings are iterable if our answer at index of I is equal to our guess if there's a match if we guess the correct letter then we're going to take our hint at that given index of I and set that equal to be our guess looks like this if statement m is outside of the while loop I'm just going to indent it by one somewhere within it okay let's do a test run I'm going to guess the letter A yes we have one a let's do something that's probably not in here Q okay so there were no matches we don't end up doing anything so what is this word probably this should be the word Orange so let's guess o r n e g all right we know that it works what if somebody types in some input that's not valid before checking if that guess is correct we'll do some input validation what if the user types in a whole word like pizza we want the user to only guess a single character not many characters we'll add the following line if the length of Our Guest that we type in does not equal one then I will print the following message let's say invalid input then we will use the keyword of continue to skip this Loop continue okay enter a letter I will type the word Pizza we get this message of invalid input we skip that Loop's current iteration I will guess a there are two A's I will type banana and again we get invalid input we have to guess one letter at a time what if somebody types in a number like one we would like to prevent that so within this if statement I would like to execute this code if our guess is not an alphabetical character I can add the following or not take our guess dot use the is Alpha method if our guess is an alphabetical character this returns true if it's not an alphabetical character it's false so we are checking if this is not an alphabetical character we execute this code let's try this again I will type in one invalid input 42069 invalid input let's say we guess the letter A what if we type in a letter we have already guessed I will guess a again if they already guessed a letter I don't want that to count we'll skip the current Loop iteration I'll add another if statement if our guess is in our set of guest letters then I will print the following I'll use an F string our guess is already guessed oh one thing I'm forgetting once we check that our guest is not within our guest characters we'll take our guess letters this is a set add the guess we're keeping track of the letters we have already guessed so I will type let's guess a we have one a if I were to guess a again we get that message of a is already guessed and then be sure to add continue to skip the current Loop iteration all right now going down to this if statement if guess is in our answer if we guess a character that's incorrect we will take our variable of wrong guesses incremented by one wrong guesses plus equal 1 let's do a test run I will guess a there is an a what about Q There is no Q we display our dictionary where the key is one we display that asky art R is there an R yes there is an R this is probably orange I would like to be sure we display the entire person I will guess some wrong characters we know that that works now we need a win condition if we guess all of the correct characters and display the entire word we'll work on that next if there are no underscore characters not in our hint this will be true if there are no underscore characters in our hint if underscores not in hint we'll call our function of display man pass in the wrong number of guesses call the function of display answer pass in our answer we will print the text of U Win then set our Boolean variable of is running equal to be false let's win this time I already know that this word is probably pineapple let's guess something incorrect there we go we have two wrong guesses but we have correctly guessed the word pineapple you win and we exit the program what if we lose I'll add the following if statement else if our variable of wrong guesses is greater than or equal so the length of our hangman art is a total of seven there's seven total keys but once we hit six we lose the game with this L statement if the length of our hangman art the length of our hangman art is going to be seven so we are going to subtract one for six for a total of six once our wrong guesses is greater than or equal to six that means we lose the game we will call the display man function pass in the wrong number of guesses display what the correct answer should have been display answer pass in our answer we will print you lose then take our Boolean variable of is running set that to be false all guess incorrect letters there the word was coconut we have six incorrect guesses we display the entire hangman the correct answer was coconut you lose if you would like to import a larger variety of words we could create a separate python file for that so within our project folder we will create a new python file I will name this python file words list this will be a python file let's take our set of words cut it I'll add a note that these are words for Hangman game Words will be a set I recommend looking online for a very large set of words that we can use then just copy and paste them within here while browsing online I found an extensive list of animals that I can use so here are all the possible words for my game so from my main python file I have to import this module of words list from the module of words list import words and now I have a greater variety of words I can use let's run this one last time this word has four letters I'll guess the vowels there's an a no e i o there is an O is it Goat nope t r bore all right the word was bore you win all right everybody so that is a game of hangman that we can create using python all right everybody so in today's video we're going to create a working alarm clock using python [Music] for this project we will need the following Imports we will import time we'll be updating our clock every second the time module is going to help us with that as well as import date time the datetime module allows us to work with string representations of a time in my opinion the easiest way to work with sound effects is to actually use pame so we will import pame now you may need to download the pame package here I'm getting a message that there's no module named pame there might be a link to install it even too one way in which you can download the py game package is to open up a terminal then use pip pip is Python's package manager pip install pame all right we have our three Imports let's create a function to set alarm we have one parameter and alarm time and for now our right pass our alarm time parameter is going to be a string representation of a time in military time I would like to start this program if I'm running my main python file directly I can add the following if statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if we are running this main python file directly then we will set the alarm but first we have to prompt the user what they would like to set the alarm to so we will Define a variable of alarm time equals ask for some user input using the input function we will prompt the user to enter the alarm time and give a format hours minutes and seconds again this is going to be in military time once we have our alarm time we will call the set alarm function and pass in our alarm time all right we are now within the set alarm function when we call this function let's print the following I'll use an F string alarm set for then include the alarm time you will need an MP3 file to work with if you don't have one available here's one recommendation you could use YouTube's audio library and then search for sound effects or some music these audio files are only allowed for non-commercial use outside of YouTube so you can search for a song or some sound effects find one that you like and download it once you find a song that you like move it to your project folder now I will create a variable of sound file equals this will be a relative or absolute file path my MP3 file is right next to my main python file I only need to list the file name I named mine my music and this is an MP3 file I'm going to perform a test run we're not going to play our sound quite yet we do have this output that displays that's says hello from the pame community let's say I set my alarm to 9:00 a.m. then enter alarm set for 9:00 a.m. if you would like to suppress this output for py game we can navigate to our virtual environment go to library pame underneath this file named Dunder init let's scroll all the way to the bottom and we should have this if statement we display the version of P game we're using and a print statement of hello from the pame community we could comment this out or even just delete it that is the most simple solution so we shouldn't get that message anymore we're going to create a Boolean variable of is running is our alarm clock running I will set that to be true while is running while this is true we will continue the alarm clock we need to get the current time current time equals we will access the date time module access the class of date time call the now method to get the time and date right now we could method chain the string format method St strf time I would like the hours minutes and seconds but not the date so we will type percent H colon let me zoom out a little percent M for minutes and percent s for seconds we're getting the hours minutes and seconds of the date and time right now and storing it within this variable of current time then I'm going to print the current time we'll perform a test run however currently we're within an infinite loop at the end of the while loop all set is running to be false okay Enter the alarm time let's say 10: a.m. alarm set for 10: a.m. and the time for me right now is 9:42 and 16 seconds we'll get rid of this line where we set is running to be false instead I'm going to access the time module and call the Sleep method we will pass in a number of seconds to sleep so 1 second I'll set the alarm to be 10: a.m. now the time should update every second which it is however when the current time is equal to the alarm time we have to trigger the alarm so after printing the current time we will write an if statement to check if the current time is equal to the alarm time if this is true then let's print the following wake up and I'll add an emoji because it's silly once our alarm triggers we will set is running to be false within the if statement let's do a test run we're not going to play the sound quite yet I will will set the alarm to 9:45 and then I'll come back a little bit later all right once the current time matches the alarm time we print wake up and set is running to be false to exit the while loop and then subsequently exiting the program now we need to play an MP3 file we will access our package of pame access the module of mixer so mixer is a module for loading and playing sounds but we have to initialize it but we're going to initialize it with init to initialize the initialized method is another way to call the Constructor we can pass in some keyword arguments for the frequency size channels buffer all that but that might be a little too complicated for us at this level we'll use the default settings by not passing in anything the next step is to load our sound file access the package of pame access the module of mixer access the module of music then call the load method we will load our sound file our sound file contains the file path to our MP3 file once we load our music we have to play it it py game. mixer. music called the play Method our MP3 file is only going to play for a brief second I'll demonstrate that I will set the alarm to 949 and just give it a few seconds our sound file stops playing when the program terminat what we need to do next is continue playing our sound file while that sound file is busy we will add a while loop while access py game. mixer music call the get busy method this returns a Boolean if our song is busy if it's still playing then we will call the time modules Sleep Method and sleep for 1 second once the song finishes or we terminate the program prematurely the sound file will no longer be busy so this should be the finished product Let's test it I will set the alarm for 952 and we just have to give it some time [Music] all right everybody in today's video we're going to build a digital clock widget using Python's Pi qt5 Library if you're new to this channel I have previously released a course on Pi qt5 in that series we've downloaded the pi qt5 package it's found within the library folder of our virtual environment within our project folder if you don't have this package you will need to download it you can open up a terminal then type the following command pip install pyqt5 enter so I already have it installed be sure that this p package of pyqt5 is within your site packages folder so let's begin at the top of our python file we will need the following Imports import CIS CIS means system this module provides variables used and maintained by the python interpreter we would also need widgets widgets are the building blocks of a guy application from the package of Pi qt5 we need to access the module of QT widgets import the following Q application Q widget this is a generic widget we'll turn our digital clock into its own widget and Q label to work with labels we will be using a layout manager more specifically QV box layout there's another import we'll need too from the package of Pi q25 access the module of QT core the QT core module it provides functionality not related to GUI components this is where we'll get a timer to keep track of the time from this module we will import Q timer Q time and QT QT is for alignment we will create a class of digital clock instead of inheriting from the main window widget we will inherit from the base class of Q widget Q widget is a base class to create our own widgets our digital clock will be a widget we will need a Constructor so let's define that Define init pass and self if there are any arguments to send to the parent we will call the Constructor of the parent the super class super call the init method at the end of The Constructor what I like to do is call a method of initialize UI init UI this will be a separate method Define init UI there are no parameters besides self and for now I'll write pass it's within this method that we will be designing the layout of the digital clock within the Constructor that's where we will be constructing all of the different entities for the clock at the end of my python file I will add the following statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of under main this statement will be true if we are running this program directly to create an application we will create an F object equals call The Constructor within the class Q application as an argument to the Constructor we will pass in the following argument access the module of CIS AR RGV which means arguments this would apply if we're running from command prompt or terminal but we won't be doing that in this video but it's nice just to set it up in case we do in the future now we are going to create a clock object clock equals we will call the Constructor of our digital clock class there are no arguments now the window doesn't appear That's because we have to use the show method of our clock take our clock call the show method now it's only going to appear for a brief second just momentarily I don't know if you saw that to ensure a clean and proper exit of our application we need to call the following method access our module of sis call the exit method then pass in the following we will take our app object then call the following method eccore and then a set of parentheses it's a method it's the execute method it starts the main event Loop of the application it also handles events such as key presses Mouse clicks or other user interactions so then we should have a window that stays in place until we exit okay now we have the base functionality all set up we have a class of digital clock that inherits from the Q widget based class we're not going to be using main window in this video within the Constructor of my digital clock I will create a label self. time label this will be a label that displays the time we will call the Constructor within the class Q label then be sure to pass in we will be adding this label directly to our widget of clock we will need a timer self. timer equals call The Constructor of Q timer then pass in self we are adding the timer to the clock now with designing the layout of our clock I'll handle that within the initialized user interface method we're we're going to set a title for the window self. set window title method passing a string that will be used for the title of the window let's say digital clock then our window should say digital clock let's set the geometry of the window self. set geometry the first two arguments are going to be for the placement of the window where will it appear here within your screen so I'll pick something approximately in the middle for me but feel free to change these values then we need a width for the window let's say 300 and a height 100 for the height so my window should appear approximately in the middle of my screen the base width is 300 the base height is 100 now we're going to need a layout manager I will name this layout manager vbox for a vertical box vbox equals call The Constructor within the class QV box this will arrange all of our widgets vertically but we only have one widget a Time label so we will take our layout manager of vbox add widget that's a method we will pass in self. time label as an argument we're adding our label to this layout manager of vbox then to set the layout we will take self that applies to our clock call the set layout method then pass in our layout manager of vbox So currently if I run this we don't see anything temporarily within our label I will add some text just as a placeholder so we can see what we're working with let's say 12:00 so then we should see something at least although the font is kind of small we will be getting rid of this later we just want to be sure that we can see everything all right so after our layout I would like the label to be Center aligned horizontally here's how we can set that up we will take our label self. time label called the set alignment method access the class of qot access align Center this should Center align our time now let's work on the font I can barely read it we will take our label self. time label set style sheet we can pass in multiple CSS like properties let's set the font size I'll set it to be 150 pixels now we can read it you could pick a font but we're going to change that at the end of this video we'll import a custom font but temporarily let's say font family aial you could change the color too so if I set the color to be green then the font color is going to be green but I would like a very specific shade of green you could always Google a Color Picker then pick a very specific color uh let's go with that something that's bright green you can copy the hex value RGB or hsl hsl means Hue saturation and lightness I'll use hsl values for the color we will type hsl add a set of parenthesis then paste those values but there is a degree symbol you do have to get rid of that now the font color is going to be bright green let's change the background color here's how we will take self that applies to our clock then call the set stylesheet method pass in a background color we will set the background color property to be black I think that looks pretty good but it doesn't quite do anything quite yet that's the next step let's create a method to update time no arguments beside self I will create a local variable of current time equals now to get the current time we can access the class of Q time Q time do call the method of current time we will need to convert it to a string we will method chain the two string method within the two string method we will Design the layout of the time so I would like hours first I will type 2 H's colon minutes that's 2 M's colon 2 s's to set the text of the label we will take self. time label call the set text method then pass in our current time so if I run this currently we still have our placeholder time let's update it with the current time we can get rid of our placeholder text of 12 we can delete it after we set the font let's call the method of update time self. update time now we should display the current time so me I'm recording this video at 7:44 in the morning if you would like to add am or p.m after your time here's how after our string format specifiers we will add capital A a means anti- meridium and P means post meridium so then we should display am or p.m. depending on when you're coding this currently the time for me is 7:45 a.m. to get the clock to update every second we need to connect our timer widget to a slot of update time we will take our timer self. timer this isn't the time label it's the timer to keep track of the time during a signal of time out we will connect the following slot of self. update time self. update time with our timer we need to trigger a timeout signal every 1,000 milliseconds every second that is to handle that we will take our timer self. timer call the start method then pass in one 1,000 for 1,000 milliseconds so then when we run this program our clock should update every second and display the new current time as an added bonus if you would like to download a custom font here's how using Google or another search engine I would recommend looking up a font of your choosing so one font that I like is DS digital what we need is a ttf file meaning true type font I'll just pick this first link so these fonts are pretty good so I'm going to download them I'll pick this specific font DS digit and again the file extension is ttf so once you have your font move it to your project folder so for convenience we have that ttf file right next to our main python file okay to work with specific fonts we will need the following import from Pi qt5 do QT GUI import Q font as well as Q font data base since we're going to use our own custom font we can delete that from the set stylesheet method of our time label so let's set the font right here we will assign a local variable a font I ID equals Q font database Q font database is a class for managing and querying fonts available to the application to add a custom font we will call the following method within it add application font within the set of quotes we're going to pass in a file path this can be a relative file path or an absolute file path this ttf file file is right next to my main python file I only need the file name my font file is named DS digit and get the file extension of ttf we will create a local variable of font family we will retrieve the name of the font family from this ID again we will access qfont database dot call the application font families method so this method returns a list of font names we will pass in our font ID but there's another step we're going to use the index of operator and get the index of zero this will retrieve the first element of the font family that's because we're working with a list we will need just the first element at index zero now we'll have a font family to work with now to set the font we will create a local variable of my font equals call the class call The Constructor within the class Q font pass in the following arguments are font family that's the first argument and then a font size let's say 150 to set the font we will take our time label self. time label call the set font method then pass in my font our custom font so then we should have our custom font that digital font that we've downloaded all right everybody so that is how to create a digital clock widget using pi qt5 hey yeah everybody so in today's video we're going to create this stopwatch program using Python's pyqt5 Library if you've been following the pyqt5 series up until this point you can skip ahead to the following timestamp where we've already set up a basic application you just have to make some minor changes if you're new to the series or new to this channel you will need the pi qt5 package found within your site packages folder if you don't have this package you can open up a terminal to download it you can use pip which is Python's package manager install Pi qt5 but I already do have it installed once that's out of the way you will need the following Imports import CIS CIS means system it handles system variables for your python interpreter we will need the following widgets from PI qt5 access the module of QT widgets widgets are the building blocks of a pi q25 application we will import the following widgets Q application Q widget Q label Q push button QV box layout and qh box layout let me put these on a new line just so we can read everything from the package of Pi qt5 access QT core we will import Q timer our timer will emit a signal after a given interval which is what we need for a stop watch Q time to keep track of the time and QT for alignment let's do a test run to be sure that there's no errors looks like L and label should be Capital there we go no errors once you have the following Imports we will construct a Class A Class of stopwatch which will inherit from The Base Class of Q widget our stopwatch will be a widget we will need a Constructor we'll Define that Dunder init no arguments beside self if we have arguments to pass to the parent of Q widget we will call the super class the parent call The Constructor of the parent no arguments currently now if we are running this file directly we'll use an if statement to verify that if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if this is true if we are running this file directly then we will construct a stopwatch we will create an app object call The Constructor within the Q application class pass in the following access sis our system access AR RGV which means arguments this is if we're using command line arguments which we won't be using but it's nice to Future proof our code just in case we do in the future we will create a stopwatch op object stopwatch equals call The Constructor within our class of stopwatch our window is not going to show unless we call the show method take our stopwatch call the show method now our window is only going to show for a brief second we need to ensure a clean exit we can access CIS call the exit method pass in the following app then call the excore method this method starts the main event Loop and handles events so then we should have a basic window which stays in place until we close it we now have the main skeletal structure of a pi qt5 application set up if you're one of the people that have jumped ahead up until this point we have a class of stopwatch which inherits from the Q widget class we've constructed a stopwatch object and we're showing it so now we can begin designing our stopwatch we will create a Time object self. time equals call The Constructor within the class of Q time for arguments we'll pass in the hours minutes seconds and milliseconds all zero we need a label for the stopwatch self. time label equals called The Constructor of Q label what would we like the text to say I'll display some placeholder text a bunch of zeros Z hours minutes seconds and milliseconds we will add this label to self our stopwatch we need a start button self. start button equals call The Constructor within Q push button what would we like the text of the button to say let's say start we are adding this button to self our stopwatch we need a stop button let's replace start with stop change the text from start to stop and reset the name of this button will be the reset button the text will be reset we will need a timer to emit a signal at a given Interval self. Timer equals call The Constructor within the class qtimer then pass in we're going to call a method of initialize UI self. init UI but we still have to Define this method all right within our stopwatch class we need the following methods a method of init UI this is where we'll be designing the user interface I'll write pass for now as a placeholder we need a method to start to start the stopwatch that is a method to stop the stopwatch a method to reset the stopwatch we'll create a method to format our time format time besides self there's one parameter we have to pass in a time to format we will be returning a string a string representation of the current time and a method to update our display update display here are the six methods we'll need within our initialize user interface method we will set the title of the window because right now it says python we will take self our stopwatch call the set window title method and we will pass in stopwatch that should change the title of the window to stopwatch we're going to use a vertical layout manager for the label and the buttons we will create a layout manager named vbox vbox equals call The Constructor of Q vbox layout we will take our layout manager and add the following widget self. time label then our start stop and reset buttons start button stop button and reset button we will take self set the layout pass in our vertical layout manager so we have all of our buttons we have our widgets arranged in a column we're going to take our time label and also Center it horizontally we will take our time label self. time Lael call the set alignment method access our class of QT access the flag of aine line Center that's going to Center align the time it should be aligned both vertically and horizontally now with your buttons they're arranged in a column we could group them together horizontally here's how we will create a horizontal layout manager of hbox hbox equals call The Constructor of qbox layout instead of adding these buttons to directly to our vertical layout manager let's cut them paste them underneath hbox replace vbox with hbox then with our vertical layout manager vbx we will add our layout of hbox this group of buttons is arranged vertically with the time label now we'll be applying a style sheet access self our stopwatch call the set style sheet method we can pass in one extremely long string with a set of triple quotes all of the CSS like properties We'll add we'll do so between the set of triple quotes let's select our buttons Q push button we are selecting an entire class within a set of curly braces let's add the property of font size the font size of all buttons will be 50 pixels let's customize our label select the class of Q label within a set of curly braces let's add the following properties font size will be 120 if you would like we can add a background color too to the label we can select a background color temporarily I will select blue but we can pick more specific shades of blue or another color here's how you can look up a Color Picker and select a very specific color you can use hex values RGB or hsl I've already selected a color I'm going to copy these hsl values so instead of a color name we will select hsl then paste those values if you have a degree symbol you will need to remove that and now we have a very specific shade of blue I will also round the corners of our label add the property of Border radius I will set that to be 20 pixels this will round the corners between each button and label We'll add some padding we're going to use multiple selectors we will select all push buttons and all labels apply the following properties to each I will add padding of 20 pixels around these widgets and I will also make the font weight bold font weight will be bold all right I think that looks pretty good hey this is bro from the future I'm currently editing this video if you would like you can add a font family one font that I think looks really good is calibri we'll apply that to all push buttons and C labels I really like this font I think it fits a stopwatch but it's up to you if you would like to change the font I just thought I would mention that now we just have to add some functionality because these buttons don't do anything for each of our buttons we have to connect a signal to a slot we will take our start button self. start button with the signal of clicked we will connect the following slot we will call the start method self. start method let's do this with the stop button change start to stop clicked connect self. stop method reset self. reset button called the reset method at a given interval we're going to update our display self. timer during a signal of timeout we will connect the following method self. update display self. update display within our start method we will take our timer self. timer call the start method pass in 10 for 10 milliseconds we will set an interval for a timeout every 10 millisecs within our stop method we will take our timer and instead call the stop method we'll get back to reset in just a moment let's work on the format time method from our time that we pass in we have to get the hours minutes seconds and milliseconds we will create some local variables hours equals access our time that we pass in call the hour method to return hours we have variable minutes time do call the minute method to return the minutes we have a variable of seconds seconds equals take our time call the second method then for milliseconds access our time call the MS EC which means milliseconds and call it this is a method I'm going to return a string an F string to represent the time we will add four placeholders hours minutes seconds and milliseconds each will be separated with a colon except for milliseconds which will be a DOT a period we will display the hours I'll add some leading zero two leading zeros let's do this for minutes we're using a format specifier for two leading zeros as well seconds and milliseconds now we will work on the update display method we have to get the time self. time equals we will take our time but call the add milliseconds method Ms ECS then pass in 10 for 10 milliseconds we're going to take our time label self. time label and set the text of it we will call our format time method but we have to pass in a time we will be passing in self. time let's see what we have currently we can start the stopwatch and we can stop it however we're displaying three digits for the milliseconds we can eliminate that within format time when we get the milliseconds we will use integer division we will divide by 10 this will convert our milliseconds from three digits to two we're basically dividing by 10 so here's our stopwatch currently we can start we can stop we can start again and we can stop again now we just need to reset here's how within the reset method we will take our timer self. timer use the stop method to stop we will reassign our time called The Constructor of Q time we have to pass in hours minutes seconds and milliseconds they're all going to be zero we're resetting our time and then we'll reset the text again of our time label self. time label call the set text method when we set the text we will first format it with the format time method but we have to pass into a time we will pass in self. time and now we should be able to reset our stopwatch we can start we can stop we can reset start again and stop again all right everybody so that is a cool stopwatch that you can make using python hey uh what's going on everybody so in today's video we're going to create a working weather app that fetches realtime weather data from an API this is a massive project so feel free to take your time take several days or even weeks if you need to complete this heck you can even add this project to your portfolio well let's get started everybody all right let's get started everybody this is a fairly useful API to get realtime weather data the website is openweathermap.org you will need your own API key but signing up for an account is free to create an account we'll go to sign in create an account enter your information and then sign in once you're signed in to find your API key go to this drop- down menu go to my API keys and you would just need to copy this API key if the status is inactive you'll need to toggle it to active like so now it may take several minutes for your API key to become active hopefully by the time of this project where we will need it it'll be active I would either leave up this window or cop copy this key and paste it somewhere if you're new to my python series we have a little bit of setup to do you will need the pi qt5 package installed if you've been following my series you can skip ahead to the following timestamp at this point we'll already have a basic window set up to download pyqt5 you can open up a terminal and use pip which is Python's package manager to install pi qt5 and myself I do already have this downloaded once you have this package downloaded and it's within your site packages folder we will need the following Imports we will import CIS CIS means system it handles system variables for your python interpreter we will import the request module to make a request to an API then we'll need widgets widgets are the building blocks of a pi qt5 application from the package of Pi qt5 access the module of QT widgets import the following widgets Q application Q widget Q label q line edit Q push button let me put some of these on a new line for readability QV box layout this is a vertical layout manager to work with alignment we'll need the following from the package of Pi qt5 from the module of QT core import the following class QT which is used for alignment so these are the Imports that you'll need just to be sure that I didn't misspell anything or get the capitalization wrong I'm just going to do a test run no problems processed finished with exit Code Zero sometimes I make one of these characters lowercase and then it doesn't work okay we have our Imports we will need to create a class of weather app weather app is going to inherit from the parent of Q widget we will need a Constructor so we'll Define that Dunder init no arguments beside self in case we have arguments to sent the parent we will call the parent with super meaning the super class then call the Constructor but currently we don't have any arguments if we are running our main python file directly we can verify that with the ni statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if we are running this file directly then we will create a weather app object otherwise we won't if this statement is true we will do the following we will create an app object app equals call The Constructor within our Q application class but we will pass in the following access the module of CIS then access a RGV which means arguments if we have command line arguments to send to our application this is how we would take care of that but we're not going to be using command line arguments in this video but it's nice to Future proof our code just in case we do we will construct a weather app object weather app equals call The Constructor of our weather app class now this window isn't going to show we have to call the show method of our weather app Weather app. Show and now it's going to show for a brief second we need to ensure a clean exit access sis call the exit method within this method we will pass in the following take our app call the execute method which is excore it is a method so we have to call it this method handles events within our application such as closing the window so now our window should stay in place until we close it if you're one of the people that have jumped ahead we have created a class of weather app which inherits from the the parent of Q widget we've constructed a weather app object and we're showing it if you've made some Pi qt5 Projects in the past you would just have to change some of these around within the Constructor of our class weather app we will declare the different widgets that belong to our weather app object we will create a label that prompts the user to enter in a city we will name this city label equals this is a q label widget we can set the initial text of the label let's say enter city name then the second argument is going to be self we are adding this label to our weather app object here's what we have currently we still have to do some CSS formatting but we'll take care of that soon we will need a line edit widget basically a text box we will name it City input the widget is line edit no parameters besides self here is our line edit widget we're not currently using a layout manager these widgets are going to overlap we need a button self. getet weather button this is a q push button the text on this button will be get weather we are adding this to self our weather app object here's our button when we click on this button we'll make a request to an API for the next following widgets we're going to add some placeholders just so that we can see what we're doing when we apply CSS styling we need a temperature label to display the temperature temperature label equals a q label temporarily for the label let's say that the temperature is 70° fah or pick something else in Celsius so to add a degree symbol if you're using Windows make sure num lock is on hold alt then on the numpad type 0176 I will pick 70° fah and then we will add this to self again we're just using this temperature as a placeholder folder we'll delete it when we do a test run if you would like to include an emoji or some other image we can create a label for that I will name this Emoji label equals a q label I will add an emoji of a sun as a placeholder again we're going to delete this when we do a test run we are adding this to self again again everything is overlapping that is fine and we need a description of the weather description label equals AQ label as a placeholder let's say that it's sunny and we are adding this label to self okay here are all the widgets they're all overlapping so we need to fix that all right Right Moving on everybody so now we have to design the layout of our web app right now all of our widgets are gravitating to the top left corner so I will Define a method to initialize our user interface at the end of this Constructor we will call this method self. initialize UI then call it once we've constructed our widgets we'll format them and design the layout so we are now within our initialized user interface method first let's set the title of our window self. set window title let's say that the title is weather app so that should change which it does we're going to use a vertical layout manager to handle all the widgets let's name the layout manager vbox equals call The Constructor of the class QV boox layout we're going to take our layout manager of v-bucks then add a widget we will start with the city label that's first we will pass in self. City label and we'll do this with the other widgets too we have City input get weather button temperature label Emoji label and then a description label take self our weather app set the layout we will pass in the layout manager of vbuck and here's what we have currently all the widgets are arranged in a column now we just have to Center align them horizontally here's how we will take self. City label call the set alignment method access the class of QT access the flag of align Center we're going to align all of our widgets in the center except for our weather button currently our button expands to take up the width of the window so we don't need to horizontally align that so we have five widgets to align we have City label City input temperature label Emoji label and description label all of the widgets are going to be arranged in a column horizontally now we just have to apply some CSS styling because right now it's kind of ugly we will apply Styles based on an object name but we have to set that object name so let's start with our city label self. City Lael call the set object name method pass in a unique ID for this widget I will name it City label I'll keep it the same okay we have to do this with the other widgets too we have a total of six we have City label City input we have the get weather button temperature label Emoji label and description label then we're going to set a stylesheet take self our weather app apply a stylesheet with set style sheet we have a lot of properties to write I will do so within a set of triple quotes just to keep everything more organized we can apply CSS Styles based on a class so the class is going to be Q label within a set of curly braces we can list multiple CSS properties I will set the font family to be calibri as well as I'll push buttons Q push button so here's the font although it's still kind of small let's select our ID of City label it's good practice to preedee this ID with the name of the class so Q label pound sign the ID we precede the ID with the name of the class just so we're only applying these CSS properties to any ID that's a city label that falls within the class of Q label let's set the font size to be 40 pixels let's set the font size to be 40 pixels that's better I'll set the font style to be italic font style italic that's pretty good let's select the ID of City input this is a line edit widget q line edit pound the ID of City input within a set of curly braces let's set the font size to be 40 pixels we will select our push button which is named get weather button the class is Q push button pound the ID of get WEA button within a set of curly braces we will apply the following let's set the font size to be 30 pixels and let's make it bold font weight bold let's select our temperature label the ID is temperature label and this is a q label pound temperature label we will increase the font size font size 75 pixels better let's work on our Emoji next we will select the ID of emoji label the class is Q label the ID is Emoji label we'll set the font size first font size 100 pixels I would like a large image to display emojis properly we're going to use a very specific font we're going to set the font family to be now I don't know if I'm saying this right seg o UI Emoji I probably pronounced this word wrong but I don't care so then our Emoji should display correctly using this font it's colorful then we have the description label of the weather that is the last widget description label the class is Q label the ID is description label let's take the font size and set it to be 50 pixels all right so this is what our weather app is going to look like we have the city label a text box to enter in a city the get weather button the temperature label an emoji label and a description of the weather currently now we just have to add some functionality because currently this doesn't do anything all right so now we just have to add some functionality to our weather app app temporarily I'm going to collapse our initialize user interface method we will Define a few extra methods let's declare a method of get WEA no parameters besid self I'll write pass for now as a placeholder we will need a method to display any errors display error there's going to be one argument besid self a message we will pass in an error message if there is one and a method to display weather that's if there's no errors we will need some data our weather data so be sure that you write these three methods back within our initialized user interface method at the bottom we have to connect a signal to a slot when we click on the button with the signal of clicked we will connect a slot of get weather we will access self take our get weather button with a signal of clicked we will connect a slot of self. getwe and I will print a test message just to be sure that it's working you get the weather so I press the button and we will display you get the weather we can get rid of our placeholder text for the temperature our emoji and the weather description so we can delete these strings But be sure to keep self scrolling down to our get weather method when we click the button we're going to create a few local variables the first is going to be our API key equals this will be a string back to the open Weather API you will copy your API key and make sure that it's active you can use the toggle button to make it inactive and active so make sure that it's active paste your API key within a string please use your own it still may take several minutes for your key to be active just keep that in mind we will need to get the city that we're looking up so let's say we type in Miami I have to get the text from this widget this line edit widget we will create a local variable of city city equals access our line edit widget it had a name of City input so self. City input to get the text we will call the text method we have the API key and the city now we will create a URL this will be an F string using the request module we will pass in a URL to make a request too so back to our open Weather API to get the URL for a city we have to go to the tab of API scroll down to current weather data and there's going to be some API documentation to the right we have a link for built-in API request by city name we will copy this URL and paste it within ourf string there's two changes we're going to make we will replace city name with City the name of that variable and API space key with API uncore key it doesn't matter what you name these just make sure they're consistent with your variables when we make an API request we will be returned with a response object response equals access our module of requests call the get method then pass in our URL with our response object we have to convert it to a Json format we will be returned with an object we will name this object data it's going to be readable to us data equals take our response object and use the Json method to convert it to a Json format so let's print our data to see what we're working with let's say I look up the city of Miami so we have one gigantic object this is our weather data we have coordinates such as longitude and latitude a weather description currently in Miami there's broken clouds there's an ID of the weather this is the temperature but it's in kelvin if we scroll all the way to the end we are looking for an HTTP status code which is named cood short for code 200 means that the response was successful depending on what this number is we will display one of a few error messages if our status code is 404 that means the city wasn't found and there's many others so 200 means that the request was successful so let's write the following if our data object at Key of cod if this is equal to 200 if the request was successful then we will call the display weather method self. displayweather but we do have to pass in our data now temporarily I'm just going to print our weather data we'll do some more complex stuff later but I just want to be sure that everything is working so let's look up Los Angeles so here's the weather in Los Angeles there is currently broken clouds and again the status code is 200 the request was successful I'll write an else statement for now we will print our data what if we can't find a city for example I will look up the city blah blah blah and get the weather so here's our weather data we have an error code of 404 and a message of City not found found let's do some exception handling in casee we run into one of these status codes that's not 200 we can get rid of our else statement what we'll do is enclose all of our dangerous code that means any code that might cause an exception within a tri block we will try all of this code and handle any exceptions with an accept block there's two types of exceptions we're looking for the first is an http error HTTP error is an exception raised by the request module when an HTTP request returns a status code that's 400 or 500 however this exception is found within the request module that we've imported so we can't simply just say accept HTTP error we first have to access the request module then access exceptions then we can list the specific exception of HTTP error we'll encounter this exception if the status code is between 400 and 500 and for now I'll right pass so there's one more step within our Tri block if we're going to handle any HTTP errrors we have to raise an exception within our Tri block because our Tri block by itself normally doesn't catch these we will take our response object and call the raise for status method this method will raise an exception if there's any HTTP errors normally our Tri block doesn't do that so we have to manually type this there's another type of exception we'll catch and that's the request exception we add another block for accept request exception this is found within the request module requests exceptions request exception with a request exception this can be due to network problems invalid URLs exceptions of that nature in case we run into one of those types of exceptions we will execute this block of code but for now I'll write pass we'll get back to it later going back to our accept block where we handle any HTTP errors let's use a match case statement we need to get the status code of our response I'll print that temporarily let's print our response objects status code and see what it is again let's make up a city get the weather we have a St status code of 404 that means the city wasn't found depending on what this number is the status code we'll use a match case statement so we will match our response objects status code the first case will be 400 that means there's a bad request so let's print the following bad request I'll add a new line character please check your input we'll create a total of I believe eight cases we'll copy what we have so we have 400 401 403 404 that one we're familiar with 5 00 502 503 504 so for case 401 that means we're unauthorized maybe our API key isn't active yet so let's say unauthorized invalid API key for 403 that means access is denied it's forbidden so let's print forbidden access is denied 404 is for something that's not found not found City not found 500 is for an internal server error internal server error please try again later 502 is for a bad gateway bad gateway invalid response from the server 503 is for service unavailable service unavailable server is down then 504 is for a Gateway timeout Gateway timeout no response from the server in case there's any unexpected error we can add a wild card of an _ with our HTTP error let's give it a name as HTTP error and then we'll just print it in case there are no matching cases let's print the following HTTP error occurred I'll add a new line let's convert this to an FST string add a placeholder and then I will print our HTTP error all right let's do a test run so in case we can't find our city we should encounter a 404 error not found City not found eventually we will display this message within our app but we know that it works what if my API key is invalid so I will take my API key set it to be inactive but it might take a few minutes to take effect the status code of our response object should be 401 so this time I'm going to look up a city I have an invalid API key and I get that error message of unauthorized invalid API key all right everybody so I am on day three of working on and recording this topic over the course of the day I thought of one change that I can make we're going to add a few extra accept blocks so we will accept access requests access exceptions we will handle any connection error exceptions as well as any timeout exceptions and any redirects too many redirects so if we run into a connection error let's say that our internet gets disconnected well we can print something so let's print the following let's print connection error I'll add a new line character check your internet connection if we encounter a timeout then we will print the f following we have a time out error the request timed out if we have a too many redirects error that M should be Capital by the way let's State too many redirects check the URL and if there's anything else we don't anticipate I'll give this exception a name of as wreck error and then we'll just print it this is a last resort I'll use an F string request error I'll add a new line I'll add a placeholder then display our request error so I'm actually going to turn off my internet I'll see if I can get a connection error intentionally so my internet is currently off I will attempt to look up a city get the weather and we get a connection error check your internet connection all right my internet is connected again let's perform a test run and we get the weather in Miami now what we're going to do is if we have an error we'll display the error message within the app and not within our console so we're going to replace print with a call to our display error method let me zoom out a little bit so replace print with self. display error and we're passing in a message so let's replace those one thing I forgot to add although it's not necessary I'm going to add a colon after each initial message I think it'll look better you don't have to do this but I'm OCD about the appearance if we encounter one of these exceptions we'll pass along a message to our display error method and display it within the app let's take our temperature label self temperature label and set the text to be our message that we pass in let's do a test run let's look up a city that doesn't exist get the weather so we get that error message not found City not found while we're within this method I'm going to change the font size just so that it's a little bit smaller so let's take our temperature label self. temperature label I'm just going to copy this cuz I'm lazy I will call the set stylesheet method and pass along a new property let's set the font size to 30 pixels let's look up north pole I don't think that's a city oh I guess it is interesting the North Pole is a city I guess let's look up blah blah blah not found City not found let's do another test what if our API key is invalid I'll just delete one of the digits let's look up Los Angeles unauthorized invalid API key let's change that back again I will turn off my internet then look up Miami Connection airor check your internet connection all right so we know that our exception handling works okay now we're within the display weather method we'll receive an object to represent our data we have to get the temperature but first I'm going to print our data so let me zoom in a little bit let's look up Houston Houston Texas I need the temperature within our data object we are looking for a key of Main and that is right here main contains a dictionary with key value pairs once we've accessed main we have to access temp to get the temperature and this temperature is in kelvin we'll have to convert it to Celsius or Fahrenheit it's your choice so so we need to extract this value I will store it as a local variable temperature let's say temperature uncore k for Kelvin equals take our data object access the key of main that's right here then we have to go one level deeper and get the temperature the key is temp then give me the value at the Key of temp and that should return the current temperature so to test it let's print it let's print the temperature in Kelvin so what is the weather in Houston Texas the temperature that is 39 Kelvin let's convert it to Celsius and Fahrenheit let's create temperature C if you want to use celsius if you would rather use Fahrenheit you can skip this step to convert from Kelvin to Celsius we will take our temperature in Kelvin subtract 273.15 then for Fahrenheit let's take temperature f for Fahrenheit equals this is a little more complicated take our temperature in Kelvin time 9 / by 5 subtract 45967 okay so let's print the temperature in celsius let's look up Houston 36.467853 [Music] let's change the temperature label self. temperature label I'll just copy this then we will set the text I'll use an F string add a placeholder I'll use Fahrenheit but feel free to use celsius then I will add a degree symbol with Windows make sure numb lock is on hold alt then on your numpad type 0176 for a degree symbol then f for Fahrenheit let's look up Miami get the weather and here's the temperature 94964 now let's say I would like no digits after the decimal I can add a format specifier after our temperature I'll add a colon 0f to display no decimals let's try that again I will look up myami get the weather the current temperature in Fahrenheit is 95° f height now here's one issue let's say we display an air then display the weather if we display an air we're going to be changing the font size so let's look up blah blah blah get the weather City not found then let's look up Miami again get the weather and the font size is a lot smaller so if we display the weather let's reset the font size we can really just copy this line L So within the display weather method let's set the font size back to 75 what it was originally let's try that again let's look up a city that doesn't exist get the weather City not found then we'll look up a city that does exist like Miami and get the weather 95° F now let's get a description of the weather we'll display that at the bottom in the center we'll display a picture or an emoji but we'll handle that last now we need a description of the weather like guess it sunny is it cloudy is it raining so after we calculate the temperature so I'm going to print our data again let's look up Los Angeles So currently it's 85° Fahrenheit so for the weather description that is found at the Key of weather we're now within a list at index zero within our list we'll look up the key of description which states clear sky so we will create a local variable of weather description equals access our data at the Key of weather there's layers to this we're then within a list and actually it's a list with only one item in it so at the index of zero then at the Key of description that's going to return this description of clear sky so we will take our description label self. description label let me just copy it this one right here then we will set the text and then pass in our weather description what is the weather description of Los Angeles 86° fhe and there's a clear sky okay now the last thing we're going to do is add an emoji We'll add it right to the center between the temperature and the weather description you don't necessarily have to but I think it'll look cool and that's a good enough reason so let's create another method to handle that we will Define a method of get weather emoy or a picture if you would rather use a picture we don't need self necessarily we're going to need a weather ID this method isn't going to rely on any class data or instance data we could make it a static method I'll add a decorator of static method in summary a static method we haven't covered these for a little bit they belong to a class but don't require any instance specific data or any other methods they're used as more of a utility tool we're going to be passing in a weather ID and returning an emoji I'm going to show you where we can find that weather ID I'll use a print statement I will print our data let's look up Miami again that's the first thing that came to mind now at the Key of weather there's a key of ID and the value is a three-digit number I'll show you this chart depending on what this three-digit number is that corresponds to a certain group of weather so the 200 range is a thunderstorm 300 is a drizzle 500 is rain 600 is snow 700 is atmosphere like if there's a tornado or there's a volcanic eruption 800 exactly is a clear sky anything that's 801 or above refers to clouds so this ID is 803 we have broken clouds depending on what this ID is I would like to return a certain Emoji based on the weather so we need this ID I'll delete our print statement we no longer need it let's say before our weather description we will create a local variable of weather ID equals access our data object then access the key of weather the value at weather is a list but this list only has one item in it so we need the index of operator at zero and then we will access the key of ID the key is ID so our weather ID is going to be a number a three-digit number okay everybody we're near the end so after setting the temperature we're going to set the Emoji label self. Emoji label and call the set text method method within the set text method we will call self. getwe Emoji method this will return a string an emoji within a string but we have to pass in our weather ID it's that three-digit number so now we are within our get weather Emoji method depending on the range of that three-digit number we will return one of a few emojis we could use a match case statement I think it's more complicated with the match case statement we'll use LF statements for Simplicity so if our weather ID is greater than or equal to 200 and our weather ID is less than or equal to 232 now we have two conditions here linked with the and logical operator there is a shortcut to this and actually py charm is telling me that there is we can simplify these Expressions instead of two separate conditions we can combine them into one if 200 is less than or equal to our weather ID and our weather ID is less than or equal to 232 if this one combined condition is true then we will return an emoji so to add an emoji on Windows you can hold down the window key and press semicolon so 200 to 232 that's for a thunderstorm depending on the font style of your IDE some of these emojis might not display properly you can always just copy them from someplace else I think that's better it's more colorful then else if 300 is less than or equal to our weather ID and our weather ID is less than or equal to 3 21 this is for a partially cloudy Sky we will return some clouds a partially cloudy sky and again I don't like that one so let's use this one instead else if 500 is less than or equal to our weather ID Which is less than or equal to 531 one we will return rain that's better 600 to 622 else if 600 is less than or equal to our weather ID Which is less than or equal to 622 we will return snow so 701 to 741 is missed or fog else if 701 is less than or equal to our weather ID Which is less than or equal to 741 we will return some mist or fog 762 specifically is for ash like from a volcano so else if our weather ID is directly equal to 762 we will return let's return a volcano 771 is for a Squall that's a violent gust of wind else if our weather ID is directly equal to 771 we will return let's return that a violent gust of wind a Squall 781 is for a tornado else if our weather ID is equal to 781 return a tornado 800 exactly is for a clear sky else if our weather ID is equal to 800 return a sun a sun emoji else if 801 is less than or equal to our weather ID Which is less than or equal to 804 we will will return some clouds now if there are no matches let's return an empty string to not display anything okay let's do a test run let's look up Miami we get scattered clouds it's 94° Los Angeles get the weather we have a clear sky and a sun now there's one fix we need to make let's say that I make up a city again blah blah blah get the weather we should clear our Emoji label and the weather description but we still get that error message so after we display our error within the display error method after we set the text of the temperature label let's take the Emoji label self. Emoji label and call the Clear method to clear it then we have to do this with the description label self. description label and call the Clear method now we should be able to clear it when we get an error okay let's look up Houston get the weather few clouds 98° let's make up a City Pizza City get the weather not found City not found and the Emoji label and the weather description are cleared okay what if I type in nothing what happens let's get the weather we have a bad request please check your input that's if we have an HTTP status C to 400 we handled this exception bad request all right one last City what about Paris let's get the weather it is 68° F and there's light rain all right everybody so that is a weather app that you can make using python add it to your portfolio and thanks for watching"
Q4377DH5Jso,Create a weather app with Python! ☀️,2024-08-08T12:25:28Z,hey uh what's going on everybody so in today's video we're going to create a working weather app that fetches real-time weather data from an API this is a massive project so feel free to take your time take several days or even weeks if you need to complete this heck you can even add this project to your portfolio well let's get started everybody all right let's get started everybody this is a fairly useful API to get real-time weather data the website is open weather map.org you will need your own API key but signing up for an account is free to create an account will go to sign in create an account enter your information and then sign in once you're signed in to find your API key go to this drop down menu go to my API keys and you would just need to copy this API key if the status is inactive you'll need to toggle it to active like so now it may take several minutes for your API key to become active hopefully by the time of this project where we will need it it'll be active I would either leave up this window or copy this key and paste it somewhere if you're new to my python series we have a little bit of setup to do you will need the pi qt5 package installed if you've been following my series you can skip ahead to the following timestamp at this point we'll already have a basic window set up to download P qt5 you can open up a terminal and use pip which is Python's package manager to install pi qt5 and myself I do already have this downloaded once you have this package downloaded and it's within your site packages folder we will need the following Imports we will import CIS CIS means system it handles system variables for your python interpreter we will import the request module to make a request to an API then we'll need widgets widgets are the building blocks of a pi qt5 application from the package of Pi qt5 access the module of QT widgets import the following widgets Q application Q widget Q label q line edit Q push button let me put some of these on a new line for readability QV box layout this is a vertical layout manager to work with alignment we'll need the following from the package of Pi qt5 from the module of QT core import the following class QT which is used for alignment so the these are the Imports that you'll need just to be sure that I didn't misspell anything or get the capitalization wrong I'm just going to do a test run no problems processed finished with exit Code Zero sometimes I make one of these characters lower case and then it doesn't work okay we have our Imports we will need to create a class of weather app weather app is going to inherit from the parent of Q widget we will need a Constructor so we'll Define that Dunder init no arguments besid self in case we have arguments to send to the parent we will call the parent with super meaning the super class then call the Constructor but currently we don't have any arguments if we are running our main python file directly we can verify that with the if statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if we are running this file directly then we will create a weather app object otherwise we won't if this statement is true we will do the following we will create an app object app equals call The Constructor within our Q application class but we will pass in the following access the module of CIS then access a RGV which means arguments if we have command line arguments to send to our application this is how we would take care of that but we're not going to be using command line arguments in this video but it's nice to Future proof our code just in case we do we will construct a weather app object weather app equals call The Constructor of our weather app class now this window isn't going to show we have to call the show method of our weather app Weather app doow and now it's going to show for a brief second we need to ensure a clean exit access sis call the exit method within this method we will pass in the following take our app call the execute method which is excore it is a method so we have to call it this method handles events within our application such as closing the window so now our window should stay in place until we close it if you're one of the people that have jumped ahead we have created a class of weather app which inherits from the parent of Q widget we've constructed a weather app object and we're showing it if you've made some Pi qt5 Projects in the past you would just have to change some of these around within the Constructor of our class weather app we will declare the different widgets that belong to our weather app app object we will create a label that prompts the user to enter in a city we will name this city label equals this is a q label widget we can set the initial text of the label let's say enter city name then the second argument is going to be self we are adding this label to our weather app object here's what we have currently we still have to do some CSS formatting but we'll take care of that soon we will need a line edit widget basically a text box we will name it City input the widget is line edit no parameters besides self here is our line edit widget we're not currently using a layout manager these widgets are going to overlap app we need a button self. getet weather button this is a q push button the text on this button will be get weather we are adding this to self our weather app object here's our button when we click on this button we'll make a request to an API for the next following widgets we're going going to add some placeholders just so that we can see what we're doing when we apply CSS styling we need a temperature label to display the temperature temperature label equals a q label temporarily for the label let's say that the temperature is 70° F or pick something else in Celsius so to add a degree symbol if you're using Windows make sure numlock is on hold Alt then on the numpad typee 0176 I will pick 70° fah and then we will add this to self again we're just using this temperature as a placeholder we'll delete it when we do a test run if you would like to include an emoji or some other image we can create a label for that I will name this Emoji label equals a q label I will add an emoji of a son as a placeholder again we're going to delete this when we do a test run we are adding this to self again everything is overlapping that is fine and we need a description of the weather description label equals a q label as a placeholder let's say that it's sunny and we are adding this label to self okay here are all the widgets they're all overlapping so we need to fix that all right moving on everybody so now we have to design the layout of our web app right now all of our widgets are gravitating to the top left corner so I will Define a method to initialize our user interface at the end of this Constructor we will call this method self. initialize UI then call it once we've constructed our widgets we'll format them and design the layout so we are now within our initialized user interface method first let's set the title of our window self. set window title let's say that the title is WEA app so that should change which it does we're going to use a vertical layout manager to handle all the widgets let's name the layout manager vbox equals call The Constructor of the class QV box layout we're going to take our layout manager of vbox then add a widget we will start with the city label that's first we will pass in self. City Lael and we'll do this with the other widgets too we have City input get weather button temperature label Emoji label and then a description label take self our weather app set the layout we will pass in the layout manager of vbox and here's what we have currently all the widgets are arranged in a column now we just have to Center align them horizontally here's how we will take self City label call the set alignment method access the class of QT access the flag of align Center we're going to align all of our widgets in the center except for our weather button currently our button expands to take up the width of the window so we don't need to horizontally align that so we have five widgets to align we have City label City input temperature label Emoji label and description label all of the widgets are going to be arranged in a column horizontally now we just have to apply some CSS styling because right now it's kind of ugly we will apply Styles based on an object name but we have to set that object name so let's start with our city label self. City label call the set object name method pass in a unique ID for this widget I will name it City label I'll keep it the same okay we have to do this with the other widgets too we have a total of six we have City label City input we have the get weather button temperature label Emoji label and description label then we're going to set a style sheet take self our weather app apply a stylesheet with set style sheet we have a lot of properties to write I will do so within a set of triple quotes just to keep everything more organized we can apply CSS Styles based on a class so the class is going to be Q Lael within a set of curly braces we can list multiple CSS properties I will set the font family to be calibri as well as all push buttons Q push button so here's the font although it's still kind of small let's select our ID of City label it's good practice to precede this ID with the name of the class so Q label pound sign the ID we precede the ID with the name of the class just so we're only applying these CSS properties to any ID that's a city label that falls within the class of Q label let's set the font size to be 40 pixels let's set the font size to be 40 pixels that's better I'll set the font style to be italic font style italic that's pretty good let's select the ID of City input this is a line edit widget q line edit pound the ID of City input within a set of curly braces let's set the font size to be 40 pixels we will select our push button which is named get weather button the class is Q push button pound the ID of get weather button within a set of curly braces we will apply the following let's set the font size to be 30 pixels and let's make it bold font weight bold let's select our temperature label the ID is temperature label and this is a q label pound temperature label we will increase the font size font size 75 pixels better let's work on our Emoji next we will select the ID of emoji label the class is Q label the ID is Emoji label we'll set the font size first font size 100 pixels I would like a large image to display emojis properly we're going to use a very specific font we're going to set the font family to be now I don't know if I'm saying this right seg o UI Emoji I probably pronounced this word wrong but I don't care so then our Emoji should display correctly using this font it's colorful then we have the description label of the web that is the last widget description label the class is Q label the ID is description label let's take the font size and set it to be 50 pixels all right so this is what our weather app is going to look like we have the city label a text box to enter in a city the get weather button the temperature label an emoji label and a description of the weather currently now we just have to add some functionality because currently this doesn't do anything all right so now we just have to add some functionality to our weather app temporarily I'm going to collapse our initialized user interface method we will Define a few extra methods let's declare a method of get weather no parameters besid self I'll write pass for now as a placeholder we will need a method to display any errors display error there's going to be one argument besid self a message we will pass in an error message if there is one and a method to display weather that's if there's no errors we will need some data our weather data so be sure that you write these three methods back within our initialized user interface method at the bottom we have to connect a signal to a slot when we click on the button with the signal of clicked we will connect a slot of get weather we will access self take our get weather button with a signal of Click we will connect a slot upself dog getwe and I will print a test message just to be sure that it's working you get the weather so I press the button and we will display you get the weather we can get rid of our placeholder text for the temperature our emoji and the weather description so we can delete these strings But be sure to keep self scrolling down to our get weather method when we click the button we're going to create a few local variables the first is going to be our API key equals this will be a string back to the open Weather API you will copy your API key and make sure that it's active you can use the to button to make it inactive and active so make sure that it's active paste your API key within a string please use your own it still may take several minutes for your key to be active just keep that in mind we will need to get the city that we're looking up so let's say we type in Miami I have to get the text from this widget this line edit widget we will create create a local variable of city city equals access our line edit widget it had a name of City input so self. City input to get the text we will call the text method we have the API key and the city now we will create a URL this will be an FST string using the request module we will pass in a URL to make a request to so back to our open Weather API to get the URL for a city we have to go to the tab of API scroll down to current weather data and there's going to be some API documentation to the right we have a link for built-in API request by city name we will copy this URL and paste it within our F string there's two changes we're going to make we will replace city name with City the name of that variable and API space key with API uncore key it doesn't matter what you name these just make sure they're consistent with your variables when we make an API request we will be returned with a response object response equals access our module of requests call the get method then pass in our URL with our response object we have to convert it to a Json format we will be returned with an object we will name this object data it's going to be readable to us data equals take our response object and use the Json method to convert it to a Json format so let's print our data to see what we're working with let's say I look up the the city of Miami so we have one gigantic object this is our weather data we have coordinates such as longitude and latitude a weather description currently in Miami there's broken clouds there's an ID of the weather this is the temperature but it's in kelvin if we scroll all the way to the end we are looking for an HTTP status code which is named Cod short for code 200 means that the response was successful depending on what this number is we will display one of a few error messages if our status code is 404 that means the city wasn't found and there's many others so 200 means that the request was successful so let's write the following if our data object at Key of cod if this is equal to 200 if the request was successful then we will call the display weather method self. displayweather but we do have to pass in our data now temporarily I'm just going to print our weather data we'll do some more complex stuff later but I just want to be sure that everything is working so let's look up Los Angeles so here's the weather in Los Angeles there is currently broken clouds and again the status code is 200 the request was successful I'll write an else statement for now we will print our data what if we can't find a city for example I will look up the city blah blah blah and get the weather so here's our weather data we have an error code of 404 and a message of City not found let's do some exception handling in case we run into one of these status codes that's not 200 we can get rid of our El statement what we'll do is enclose all of our dangerous code that means any code that might cause an exception within a tri block we will try all of this code and handle any exceptions with an accept block there's two types of exceptions we're looking for the first is an HTTP error HTTP error is an exception raised by the request module when an HTTP request returns a status code that's 400 or 500 however this exception is found within in the request module that we've imported so we can't simply just say accept HTTP error we first have to access the request module then access exceptions then we can list the specific exception of HTTP error we'll encounter this exception if the status code is between 400 and 500 for now all right pass so there's one more step within our Tri block if we're going to handle any HTTP errors we have to raise an exception within our Tri block because our Tri block by itself normally doesn't catch these we will take our response object and call the raise for status method this method will raise an exception if there's any HT TTP errors normally our Tri block doesn't do that so we have to manually type this there's another type of acception we'll catch and that's the request exception We'll add another block for accept request exception this is found within the request module requests exceptions request exception with a request exception this can be due to network problems invalid URLs exceptions of that nature in case we run into one of those types of exceptions we will execute this block of code but for now I'll write pass we'll get back to it later going back to our accept block where we handle any HTTP errors let's use a match case statement we need to get the status code of our response I'll print that temporarily let's print our response objects status code and see what it is again let's make up a city get the weather we have a status code of 404 that means the city wasn't found depending on what this number is the status code we'll use a match case statement so we will match our response objects status code the first case will be 400 that means there's a bad request so let's print the following bad request I'll add a new line character please check your input we'll create a total of I believe eight cases we'll copy what we have so we have 400 401 403 44 that one we're familiar with 500 502 503 504 so for case 401 that means we're unauthorized maybe our API key isn't active yet so let's say unauthorized invalid API key for 403 that means access is denied it's forbidden so let's print forbidden access is denied 4 for is for something that's not found not found City not found 500 is for an internal server error internal server error please try again later 502 is for a bad gateway bad gateway invalid response from the server 503 is for service unavailable service unavailable server is down then 504 is for a Gateway timeout Gateway timeout no response from the server in case there's any unexpected error we can add a wild card of an underscore with our HTTP error let's give it a name as HTTP error and then we'll just print it in case there are no matching cases let's print the following HTTP error occurred I'll add a new line let's convert this to an FST string add a placeholder and then I will print our HTTP eror all right let's do a test run so in case we can't find our city we should encounter a 404 error not found City not found eventually we will display this message within our app but we know that it works what if my API key is invalid so I will take my API key set it to be inactive but it might take a few minutes to take effect the status code of our response object should be 401 so this time I'm going to look up a city I have an invalid API key and I get that error message of unauthorized invalid API key all right everybody so I am on day three of working on and recording this topic over the course of the day I thought of one change that I can make we're going to add a few extra accept blocks so we will accept access requests access exceptions we will handle any connection eror exceptions as well as any timeout exceptions and any redirects too many redirects so if we run into a connection error let's say that our internet gets disconnected well we can print something so let's print the following let's print connection error I'll add a new line character check your internet connection if we encounter a timeout then we will print the following we have a time out error the request timed out if we have a too many redirects error that M should be Capital by the way let's State too many redirects check the URL and if there's anything else we don't anticipate I'll give this exception a name of as wreck error and then we'll just print it this is a last resort I'll use an F string request error I'll add a new line I'll add a placeholder then display our request error so I'm actually going to turn off my internet I'll see if I can get a connection error intentionally so my internet is currently off I will attempt to look up a city get the weather and we get a connection air check your internet connection all right my internet is connected again let's perform a test run and we get the weather in Miami now what we're going to do is if we have an error we'll display the error message within the app and not within our console so we're going to replace print with a call to our display error method let me zoom out a little bit so replace print with self dot display error and we're passing in a message so let's replace those one thing I forgot to add although it's not necessary I'm going to add a colon after each initial message I think it'll look better you don't have to do this but I'm OCD about the appearance if we encounter one of these exceptions we'll pass along a message to our display error method and display it within the app let's take our temperature label self. temperature label and set the text to be our message that we pass in let's do a test run let's look up a city that doesn't exist get the weather so we get that error message not found City not found while we're within this method I'm going to change the font size just so that it's a little bit smaller so let's take our temperature label self. temperature label I'm just going to copy this CU I'm lazy I will call the set stylesheet method and pass along a new property let let's set the font size to 30 pixels let's look up north pole I don't think that's a city oh I guess it is interesting the North Pole is a city I guess let's look up blah blah blah not found City not found let's do another test what if our API key is invalid I'll just delete one of the digits let's look up Los Angeles unauthorized invalid API key let's change that back again I will turn off my internet then look up Miami Connection Error check your internet connection all right so we know that our exception handling works okay now we're within the display weather method we'll receive an object to represent our data we have to get the temperature but first I'm going to print our data so let me zoom in a little bit let's look up Houston Houston Texas I need the temperature within our data object we are looking for a key of Main and that is right here main contains a dictionary with key value pairs once we've accessed main we have to access temp to get the temperature and this temperature is in kelvin we'll have to convert it to Celsius or Fahrenheit it's your choice so we need to extract this value I will store it as a local variable temperature let's say temperature uncore k for Kelvin equals take our data object access the key of main that's right here then we have to go one level deeper and get the temperature the key is temp then give me the value at the Key of temp and that should return the current temperature so to test it let's print it let's print the temperature in Kelvin so what is the weather in Houston Texas the temperature that is 309 Kelvin let's convert it to Celsius and Fahrenheit let's create temperature C if you want to use celsius if you would rather use Fahrenheit you can skip this step to convert from Kelvin to Celsius we will take our temperature in Kelvin subtract 273.15 then for Fahrenheit let's take temperature f for Fahrenheit equals this is a little more complicated take our temperature in Kelvin time 9 / 5 subtract 45967 okay so let's print the temperature in celsius let's look up Houston 36.467853 [Music] 97.6 Dees fah that's pretty hot all right so once we have our temperature let's change the temperature label self. temperature label I'll just copy this then we will set the text I'll use an F string add a placeholder I'll use Fahrenheit but feel free to use celsius then I will add a degree symbol with Windows make sure numb lock is on hold alt then on your numpad type 0176 for a degree symbol then f for Fahrenheit let's look up Miami get the weather and here's the temperature 94964 now let's say I would like no digits after the decimal I can add a format specifier after our temperature I'll add a colon 0f to display no decimals let's try that again I will look up Miami get the weather the current temperature in Fahrenheit is 95° Fahrenheit now here's one issue let's say we display an error then display the weather if we display an airror we're going to be changing the font size so let's look up blah blah blah get the weather City not found then let's look look up Miami again get the weather and the font size is a lot smaller so if we display the weather let's reset the font size we can really just copy this line so within the display weather method let's set the font size back to 75 what it was originally let's try that again let's look up a city that doesn't exist get the weather City not found then we'll look up the city that does exist like Miami and get the weather 95° F now let's get a description of the weather we'll display that at the bottom in the center we'll display a picture or an emoji but we'll handle that last now we need a description of the weather like is it sunny is it cloudy is it raining so after we calculate the temperature so I'm going to print our data again let's look up Los Angeles So currently it's 85 degrees Fahrenheit so for the weather description that is found at the Key of weather we're now within a list at index zero within our list we'll look up the key of description which states clear sky so we will create a local variable of weather description equals access our data at the Key of weather there's layers to this we're then within a list and actually it's a list with only one item in it so at the index of zero then at the Key of description that's going to return this description of clear sky so we will take our description label self. description label let me just copy it this one right here then we will set the text and then pass in our weather description what is the weather description of Los Angeles 86° Fahrenheit and there's a clear sky okay now the last thing we're going to do is add an emoji We'll add it right to the center between the temperature and the weather description you don't necessarily have to but I think it'll look cool and that's a good enough reason so let's create another method to handle that we will Define a method of get weather Emoji or picture if you would rather use a picture we don't need self necessarily we're going to need a weather ID this method isn't going to rely on any class data or instance data we could make it a static method I'll add a decorator of static method in summary a static method we haven't covered these for a little bit they belong to a class but don't require any instance specific data or any other methods they're used as more of a utility tool we're going to be passing in a weather ID and returning an emoji I'm going to show you where we can find that weather ID I'll use a print statement I will print our data let's look up Miami again that's the first thing that came to mind now at the Key of weather there's a key of ID and the value is a three-digit number I'll show you this chart depending on what this three-digit number is that corresponds to a certain group of weather so the 200 range is a thunderstorm 300 is a drizzle 500 is rain 600 is snow 700 is atmosphere like if there's a tornado or there's a volcanic eruption 800 exactly is a clear sky anything that's 801 or above refers to clouds so this ID is 803 we have broken clouds depending on what this ID is I would like to return a certain Emoji based on the weather so we need this ID I'll delete our print statement we no longer need it let's say before our weather description we will create a local variable of weather ID equals access our data object then access the key of weather the value at weather is a list but this list only has one item in it so we need the index of operator at zero and then we will access the key of ID the key is ID so our weather ID is going to be a number a three-digit number okay everybody we're near the end so after setting the temperature we're going to set the Emoji label self. Emoji label and call the set text method within the set text method we will call self. getwe Emoji method this will return a string an emoji within a string but we have to pass in our weather ID it's that three-digit number so now we are within our get weather Emoji method depending on the range of that three-digit number we will return one of a few emojis we could use a match case statement I think it's more complicated with the match case statement we'll use LF statements for Simplicity so if our weather ID is greater than or equal to 200 and our weather ID is less than or equal to 232 now we have two conditions here linked with the and logical operator there is a shortcut to this and actually py charm is telling me that there is we can simplify these Expressions instead of two separate conditions we can combine them into one if 200 is less than or equal to our weather ID and our weather ID is less than or equal to 232 if this one combined condition is true then we will return an emoji so to add an emoji on Windows you can hold on the window key and press semicolon so 200 to 232 that's for a thunderstorm depending on the font style of your IDE some of these emojis might not display properly you can always just copy them from some place else I think that's better it's more colorful than else if 300 is less than or equal to our weather ID and our weather ID is less than or equal to 321 this is for a partially cloudy Sky we will return some clouds a partially cloudy sky and again I don't like that one so let's use this one instead else if 500 is less than or equal to our weather ID Which is less than or equal to 531 we will return rain that's better 600 to 622 else if 600 is less than or equal to our weather ID Which is less than or equal to 622 we will return snow so 701 to 741 is missed or fog else if 701 is less than or equal to our weather ID Which is less than or equal to 741 we will return some mist or fog 762 specifically is for ash like from a volcano so else if our weather ID is directly equal to 762 we will return let's return a volcano 771 is for a Squall that's a violent gust of wind else if our weather ID is directly equal to 771 we will return let's return that a violent gust of wind a Squall 781 is for a Tado else if our weather ID is equal to 781 return a tornado 800 exactly is for a clear sky else if our weather ID is equal to 800 return a sun a sun emoji else if 801 is less than or equal to our weather ID Which is less than or equal to 804 we will return some clouds now if there are no matches let's return an empty string to not display anything okay let's do a test run let's look up Miami we get scattered clouds it's 94° Los Angeles get the weather we have a clear sky and a sun now there's one fix we need to make let's say that I make up a city again blah blah blah get the weather we should clear our Emoji label and the weather description but we still get that error message so after we display our error within the display error method after we set the text of the temperature label let's take the Emoji label self. Emoji label and call the Clear method to clear it then we have to do this with the description label self. description label and call the Clear method now we should be able to clear it when we get an error okay let's look up Houston get the weather few clouds 98° let's make up a City Pizza City get the weather not found City not found and the Emoji label and the weather description are cleared okay what if I type in nothing what happens let's get the weather we have a bad request please check your input that's if we have an HTTP status C to 400 we handled this exception bad request all right one last City what about Paris let's get the weather it is 68° F and there's light rain all right everybody so that is a weather app that you can make using python add it to your portfolio and thanks for watching
UKs0xhxSOg0,Code a stopwatch using Python! ⏱,2024-08-02T13:00:36Z,hey yeah everybody so in today's video we're going to create this stopwatch program using Python's pyqt5 Library if you've been following the pi qt5 series up until this point you can skip ahead to the following timestamp where we've already set up a basic application you just have to make some minor changes if you're new to this series or new to this channel you will need the pi q25 package found within your site packages folder if you don't have this package you can open up a terminal to download it you can use pip which is Python's package manager install Pi qt5 but I already do have it installed once that's out of the way you will need the following Imports import CIS CIS means system it handles system variables for your python interpreter we will need the following widgets from PI qt5 access the module of QT widgets widgets are the building blocks of a pi qt5 application we will import the following widgets Q application Q widget Q label Q push button QV box layout and qh box layout let me put these on a new line just so we can read everything from the package of Pi qt5 access QT core we will import Q timer our timer will emit a signal after a given interval which is what we need for a stopwatch Q time to keep track of the time and QT for alignment let's do a test run to be sure that there's no errors looks like L and label should be Capital there we go no errors once you have the following Imports we will construct Class A Class of stopwatch which will inherit from The Base Class of Q widget our stopwatch will be a widget we will need a Constructor we'll Define that Dunder init no arguments besid self if we have arguments to pass to the parent of Q widget we will call the super class the parent call The Constructor of the parent no arguments currently now if we are running this file directly we'll use an if statement to verify that if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if this is true if we are running this file directly then we will construct a stopwatch we will create an app object call The Constructor within the Q application class pass in the following access sis our system access AR RGV which means arguments this is if we're using command line arguments which we won't be using but it's nice to Future proof our code just in case we do in the future we will create a stopwatch object stopwatch equals call The Constructor within our class of stopwatch our window is not going to show unless we call the show method take our stopwatch call the show method now our window is only going to show for a brief second we need to ensure a clean exit we can access CIS call the exit method pass in the following app then call the excore method this method starts the main event Loop and handles events so then we should have a basic window which stays in place until we close it we now have the main skeletal structure of a pi qt5 application set up if you're one of the people that have jumped ahead up until this point we have a class of stopwatch which inherits from the Q widget class we've constructed a stopwatch object and we're showing it so now we can begin designing our stopwatch we will create a Time object self. time equals call The Constructor within the class of Q time for arguments we'll pass in the hours minutes seconds and milliseconds all zero we need a label for the stopwatch self. time label equals called The Constructor of Q label what would we like the text to say I'll display some placeholder text a bunch of zeros zero hours minutes seconds and milliseconds we will add this label to self our stopwatch we need a start button self. start button equals call The Constructor within Q push button what would we like the text of the button to say let's say start we are adding this button to self our stopwatch we need a stop button let's replace start with stop change the text from start to stop and reset the name of this button will be the reset button the text will be reset we will need a timer to emit a signal at a given Interval self. Timer equals call The Constructor within the class qtimer then pass in self we're going to call a method of initialize UI self. init UI but we still have to Define this method all right within our stopwatch class we need the following methods a method of init UI this is where we'll be designing the user interface I'll write pass for now as a placeholder we need a method to start to start the stopwatch that is a method to stop the stopwatch a method to reset the stopwatch we'll create a method to to format our time format time besides self there's one parameter we have to pass in a time to format we will be returning a string a string representation of the current time and a method to update our display update display here are the six methods we'll need within our initialized user interface method we will set the title of the window because right now it says python we will take self our stopwatch call the set window title method and we will pass in stopwatch that should change the title of the window to stopwatch we're going to use a vertical layout manager for the label and the buttons we will create a layout manager named vbox vbox equals equs call The Constructor of q v box layout we will take our layout manager and add the following widgets self. time Lael then our start stop and reset buttons start button stop button and and reset button we will take self set the layout pass in our vertical layout manager so we have all of our buttons we have our widgets arranged in a column we're going to take our time label and also Center it horizontally we will take our time label self. time label call the set alignment method access our class of QT access the flag of align Center that's going to centeralign the time it should be aligned both vertically and horizontally now with your buttons they're arranged in a column we could group them together horizontally here's how we will create a horizontal layout manager of hbox hbox equals call The Constructor of qbox layout instead of adding these buttons directly to our vertical layout manager let's cut them paste them underneath hbox replace vbox with hbox then with our vertical layout manager vbox we will add our layout of hbox this group of buttons is arranged vertically with the time label now we'll be applying a style sheet access self our stopwatch call the set style sheet method we can pass in one extremely long string with a set of triple quotes all of the CSS like properties We'll add will do so between the set of triple quotes let's select our buttons Q push button we are selecting an entire class within a set of curly braces let's add the property of font size the font size of all buttons will be 50 pixels let's customize our label select the class of Q label within a set of curly braces let's add the following properties ities font size will be 120 if you would like we can add a background color too to the label we can select a background color temporarily I will select blue but we can pick more specific shades of blue or another color here's how you can look up a Color Picker and select a very specific color you can use hex values RG b or hsl I've already selected a color I'm going to copy these hsl values so instead of a color name we will select hsl then paste those values if you have a degree symbol you will need to remove that and now we have a very specific shade of blue I will also round the corners of our label add the property of Border radius I will set that to be 20 pixels this will round the corners between each button and label we'll add some padding we're going to use multiple selectors we will select all push buttons and all labels apply the following properties to each I will add padding of 20 pixels around these widgets and I will also make the font weight bold font weight will be bold all right I think that looks pretty good hey this is bro from the future I am currently editing this video if you would like you can add a font family one font that I think looks really good is calibri we'll apply that to all push buttons and Q labels I really like this font I think it fits a stopwatch but it's up to you if you would like to change the font I just thought I would mention that now we just have to add some functionality because these buttons don't do anything for each of our buttons we have to connect a signal to a slot we will take our start button self. start button with the signal of clicked we will connect the following slot we will call the start method self. start method let's do this with the stop button change start to stop clicked connect self. stop method reset self. reset button called the reset method at a given interval we're going to update our display self. timer during a signal of timeout we will connect the following method self. update display self. update display within our start method we will take our timer self. timer call the start method pass in 10 for 10 milliseconds we will set an interval for a timeout every 10 milliseconds within our stop method we will take our timer and instead called the stop method we'll get back to reset in just a moment let's work on the format time method from our time that we pass in we have to get the hours minutes seconds and milliseconds we will create some local variables hours equals access our time that we pass in call the hour method to return hours we have variable minutes time do call the minute method to return the minutes we have a variable of seconds seconds equals take our time called the second method then for milliseconds access our time call the MC which means milliseconds and call it this is a method I'm going to return a string an F string to represent the time we will add four placeholders hours minutes seconds and milliseconds each will be separated with the colon except for milliseconds which will be a DOT a period we will display the hours I'll add some leading zeros two leading zeros let's do this for minutes we're using a format specifier for two leading zeros as well seconds and milliseconds now we will work on the update display method we have to get the time self. time equals we will take our time but call the add milliseconds method Ms e CS then pass in 10 for 10 milliseconds we're going to take our time label self. time label and set the text of it we will call our format time method but we have to pass in a time we will be passing in self. time let's see what we have currently we can start the stopwatch and we can stop it however we're displaying three digits for the milliseconds we can eliminate that within format time when we get the milliseconds we will use integer division we will divide by 10 this will convert our milliseconds from three digits to two we're basically dividing by 10 so here's our stopwatch currently we can start we can stop we can start again and we can stop again now we just need to reset here's how within the reset method we will take our timer self. timer use the stop method to stop we will reassign our time call The Constructor of Q time we have to pass in hours minutes seconds and milliseconds they're all going to be zero we're resetting our time and then we'll reset the text again of our time label self. time Lael call the set text method when we set the text we will first format it with the format time method but we have to pass in a time we will pass in self. time and now we should be able to reset our stopwatch we can start we can stop we can reset start again and stop again all right everybody so that is a cool stopwatch that you can make using python
DZ3-ij_JHE0,Python PyQt5 RADIO BUTTONS are easy! 🔘,2024-07-28T14:18:30Z,all right let's do this thing today I got to talk about radio buttons in pi qt5 to work with radio buttons we will need the following imports from the module of QT widgets we will need the class of Q radio button as well as Q button group to group together different buttons let's create three radio buttons within the Constructor of my main window we will construct three radio buttons for the first radio button this will be named radio one we will call the Constructor of the class Q radio button then we can pass in some text what is the radio button going to say let's say that we're working with payment options let's say visa for the first option then for the second argument I will pass inself we will add this radio button directly to our window that would be self let's create two more additional radio buttons radio Radio 2 and radio 3 the text of radio button two will be MasterCard and three will be a gift card we are selecting different payment options we need to set the geometry of these radio buttons because we're not using a layout manager I have a method to initialize my user interface this is where I will set the geometry of my radio buttons so let's say self. radio1 we will call the set set geometry method pass in some coordinates 0 0 is good that applies to the top left corner of my window for the width 300 and the height 50 is good let's do this with radio buttons 2 and three Radio 2 radio 3 we'll just move each radio button down on the Y AIS by 50 pixels each so 50 then 100 here are the three radio buttons however the font is kind of small we can barely see it so let's apply a stylesheet here's a trick that we can do with stylesheets we can apply multiple CSS like properties to an entire group of widgets rather than having to type them and apply them individually we will select our window of self set the stylesheet of our window with the set stylesheet method we will add a selector the selector is going to be the name of the widget Q radio button in this case then add a set of curly braces we can apply CSS like properties to an entire group of widgets this way so let's set the font size of all radio buttons to be 40 pixels better let's set the font family to be aial then I will add a little bit of P padding around each radio button padding 10 pixels that's pretty good so with radio buttons we can only select one from any one radio button group if I was making a payment I can't pay with a Visa and Mastercard at the same time I can only select one option that's the point of radio buttons we're limited to just one option with the default behavior of Pi qt5 all radio buttons unless explicitly stated are all part of the same group to demonstrate that let's create two additional radio buttons Radio 4 and Radio 5 radio button 4 will be for a payment method rather than a payment type for example we could say we're paying in store radio button 5 will be we're paying online radio buttons 1 through 3 will be for the payment type radio buttons 4 5 will be for the payment method we're either paying in store or we're ordering something online we do need to set the geometry for these two radio buttons I'll just copy these two lines add Radio 4 Radio 5 we'll set the y-coordinate of four to be 150 and 5 to be 200 all radio buttons will be within the same button group if I was to select in store we deselect one of these options what I would like is one option from this first group and another option from this other group these buttons are all in the same group I can only select one if I would like to pay with the VISA in store and I click the in store radio button we unelect the radio button for Visa I would like these radio buttons within different groups we need to create two different groups and add them accordingly here's how within our Constructor we will act access self declare a button group let's name it button group one for Simplicity equals call The Constructor of the class Q button group then pass in to set the parent widget to be the window then we will create button group two we're going to access self select the radio button group button group one call the add button method then pass in a radio button self. Radio 1 then we'll add Radio 2 and radio 3 we'll select button group two this time button group two add radio button 4 and radio button 5 the first three radio buttons are within the same group radio buttons four and five are within a different group we can only select one radio button from any one radio button group maybe I would like to pay with a Visa card in store or a master card online or a gift card in store these radio buttons are within different button groups we're limited to one selection in any one radio button group when we select these radio buttons they don't quite do anything for each radio button we have to connect a signal to a slot here's how let's define a method of radio button changed there will be no parameters beside self temporarily I'll write pass we'll fill this in in a moment we will take each radio button let's start with radio one Radio One the signal will be toggled when this radio button is toggled we will connect a slot we will pass in a function or a method self do radio button changed then we will do this with the other radio buttons 1 through 5 let's print a test message you selected something just to be sure that everything is working you selected something okay we know that that works currently what we're going to need to do is get the sender widget which radio button sent the signal of toggled I will create a local radio button to store that radio button whichever one emitted the signal we can determine that with self. sender method the sender method is going to return the widget that sent the signal so if we select radio button one our radio button will be radio button one if it was five then it's five in this case then we'll determine if our radio button is checked take our radio button use the is checked method this will return a Boolean true or false if it's checked if this returns true then let's print the following all an F string we will get the text of the radio button radio button called the text method to return the text of the radio button is selected all right then let's see if this works let's select Visa Visa is selected MasterCard is selected gift card is selected in store is selected and online is selected that's how to to determine which radio button was selected which one is the sender which one sent the signal all right everybody so that is an introduction to radio buttons in pi qt5
L7tT0NZF-Ag,Learn Python MATCH-CASE STATEMENTS in 5 minutes! 📆,2024-07-27T16:19:22Z,hey everybody so today I'm going to explain match case statements in Python if you're familiar with other programming languages this is also known as a switch match case statements are alternatives to using many LF statements we execute some code if a value matches a case the benefits of using a match case statement is that they're cleaner and the syntax is more readable in this sample program I have a function there is one parameter a day day will be a number ideally a number 1 through 7 depending on this number we'll return a string corresponding to the day of the week if day equals 1 then it is Sunday two it is Monday all the way up to 7 where it will be Saturday I do have an else Clause if we pass in something that's not valid like pizza pizza is not not a day but it really should be not a valid day a cleaner and more readable alternative is to use a match case statement instead of many l if statements here's how I'm going to take my if and many l if statements and enclose them within a match case match case the case is going to be the value we're examining the case will be day colon we're going to to examine our value of day against matching cases we're going to replace if day equals with the following just simply case so let's do that with each of these statements if you have an else Clause you're instead going to have a case of underscore an underscore and a match case statement is a wild card we will perform this case if there are no matching cases this case would function as the else statement here's what we're working with now if I pass in one and return the day of the week we would get Sunday two would be Monday 3 Tuesday s is Saturday and then let's try that day of pizza that is not a valid day a match case statement is an alternative to using many LF statements I find this much easier to read than the many LF statements both would technically function let's go over a second example we will create a function of is weekend we have to pass in a day this time our day is going to be a string such as Monday the value for each case instead of a number is going to be a string if our day matches a case of Sunday let's return how about a Boolean of true we're checking to see if it's the weekend if our day is equal to a case of Monday then we will return false let's do this with the other days I'm going to fast forward the video we will call the function of is weekend then pass in a day of the week such as Monday so is Sunday the weekend that is true Monday that is false Saturday that is true and we do have a wild card case if there are no matches is pizza a day of the weekend that is false there is a way we can modify this match case too we tend to be repeating ourselves a lot the days Monday through Friday all return false we're going to use the orical operator which is represented with a vertical bar if the case of Saturday or Sunday return true if the case is Monday or Tuesday you can get rid of that or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday then we will return false we can keep our Wild Card case so is Saturday part of the weekend that is true is Monday false Sunday true Friday false and pizza we have our Wild Card case that gives us false all right everybody so those are match case statements they're similar to switches in other programming languages they're an alternative to using many lsip statements we execute some code if a value matches a case the benefits is that the code is cleaner and the syntax is more readable and well everybody those are match case statements in Python
VgnUB_vzR9I,Create Python checkboxes in 5 minutes! ✅,2024-07-27T13:01:25Z,hey yeah so today I got to explain a checkboxes in pqt 5 to work with checkboxes we will need the following import from the module of widgets from pyqt5 import Q check box to work with different states we will also need the following import from PI qt5 do QT core import QT this module of QT core it contains non- goey classes relevant to Pi qt5 applications so be sure that you get this import as well to create a checkbox I will create this within the Constructor of my main window we will create a checkbox with self the name of the checkbox which I will name checkbox equals call The Constructor of the Q checkbox class the first argument is going to be the text of the checkbox what do you want the check boox to say let's ask do you like food the second argument is the parent widget where we will be adding this checkbox let's say self self will apply to this window we could use a layout manager but I want to keep this lesson as simple as possible we're just going to focus on checkboxes and their functionality so we should have a checkbox however we can barely see it the font is really really small I have a method to initialize the user interface that's where we'll set the stylesheet and the geometry of our checkbox let's set the stylesheet self dot the name of the checkbox checkbox do set Styles sheet method then we can pass in some CSS like properties let's set the font size to be 30 pixels and I will pick a font family font family aial oh and we should change the geometry of the label it's getting cut off self dot the name of the checkbox which is checkbox let's set the geometry pass in some X and Y coordinates for the placement as well as a width and the height I will pick 500 and 100 uh maybe I'll move it a little more to the right by 10 pixels that's pretty good our checkbox has an initial State it's normally unchecked that's the default Behavior but we could set that to be checked with the following method when the window loads let's take our checkbox self. checkbox call the set checked method then pass in true so then when the window loads the checkbox is already checked but let's keep that as false now this checkbox it doesn't do anything when I check it let's add some functionality we'll take our checkbox connect a signal to a slot the slot can be a function or a method let's define a method within our main window class let's name this me method checkbox changed we will call this method when the state of our checkbox changes there is one parameter besides self a state now the state parameter is going to be provided to us when we interact with our checkbox when we check the checkbox let's print something like a test message you like food we have to connect a signal of State changed to a slot of checkbox changed we will take self dot the name of the checkbox which is checkbox the signal will be State changed to connect a slot to a signal we use the connect method then pass in a function or method name so we are working with methods this method belongs to the window class we'll prefix the method name with self self. checkbox changed so when I run this program when I check the checkbox we execute this method you like food now when I uncheck it I instead would like to display you do not like food so that's where our state is going to come in I'm going to print our state just to see what it is our state is going to be a value when we check the check boox our state has a value of two when we uncheck it it has a value of zero 0 means unchecked two means checked there's also one for partially checked but that's not going to be relevant to this topic so zero or two we could add an if statement such as if state is equal to two then print you like food however that's not really readable other developers looking over your code are going to understand what two is by looking at it instead let's use the following we will access the class of QT there's a built-in constant of checked this also equals two but it's more readable it's a constant so if state is equal to QT checked print you like food I will check the checkbox you like food when I uncheck it nothing happens let's add an else statement else let's print you do not like food so then when I check the checkbox we print you like food when I uncheck it we print you do not like food you like food you do not like food you like food you do not like food all right everybody so that is an introduction to checkboxes in pi qt5
9pl55MxZlG4,Create Python buttons in 7 minutes! 🛎️,2024-07-26T13:01:00Z,today I'm going to show you how we can create push button widgets in pi qt5 to begin we will need the following Imports Q push button as well as Q label for this demonstration during the previous topic on layout managers within our Constructor for our main window we defined a method of initialize UI for user interface let's be sure that we're calling that method within our Constructor within this method is where we'll be handling managing the user interface to create a button we will call the push button Constructor normally when creating widgets we would want to prefix that widget with self then follow the name of the widget for example button however I'm going to demonstrate what happens when we don't do that because without self we're declaring a local variable we'll get back to that in just a moment let's create a local button object by calling the Q push button Constructor we can pass in some text such as as click me we will add this to our window self self refers to our window object let's set the geometry of the button button. set geometry we could use a layout manager but I do want to keep this lesson as simple as possible so let's pick some coordinates I've picked the following for the X and Y coordinates 150 and 200 for the width 200 and the height 100 here's is our button currently the font is a little small so I'm going to set the style sheet set style sheet I'll just increase the font size we could use Q font but that might be overkill for this demonstration let's just say the font size will be 30 pixels now we can read it so we have our button we're going to be connecting our button to a function but we need to Define that function we'll do so within our main window class so we will Define a function of onclick there are no parameters besides self when we click on the button what would we like to do let's print a test message let's say button clicked and that's it when we click this button nothing happens we have to set up a signal and slot for the button here's how we will take our button do list of signal a signal is emitted when a widget is interacted with we have to list the type of signal so the signal we're looking for is clicked when we click this button we will perform a slot an action we will take the signal of clicked connect it to a slot connect is a method the slot will be self do the name of the method on click when we press this button we perform this slot this method of onclick each time I press the button we perform that action not only should we print a message for this demonstration let's set the text to the button so we have button. set text let's change the text to clicked so this actually isn't going to work because we're not prefixing self let me demonstrate what happens we print button clicked but then we have a problem we have an exit code our program was interrupted button is considered local to our initializer method our onclick function doesn't recognize what our button is that's why we're going to prefix our button with self so it belongs to the class of main window and not this method any instance of button we're going to prefix with self and now this should work the text on my button is going to change when I click it clicked you don't have to do this but with my personal coding style whenever I create a variable or an object within a class I like to do so within the Constructor even py charm is giving me a warning when we declare this button I'm going to move it to the Constructor and let me just rearrange everything self. button equals a q push button widget within my initializer method that's when I like to rearrange everything and style it we can also disable buttons when we click on them to do that we will take self. button call the set disabled method then pass in true when I click the button it will be disabled I can no longer click on it for the last part of this demonstration when we click on our button let's change the text of a label let's declare self. label within our Constructor equals a q label the text of the label will be hello we will add this label to self the window when we set up the user interface let's set the geometry of the label self. Lael do set geometry we could use a layout manager but just to keep things simple I'm going to set some coordinates 150 for X 300 for y the width will be 200 and the height 100 let's change the font size self. label. set style sheet I will set the font size to be 30 maybe 50 better all right within our onclick function let's instead take self. label. set text method then pass s some new text to display we're saying hello but when we click the button let's say goodbye so now when I click the button we will change the text on a separate widget my label which now says goodbye so with buttons you need a signal that's connected to a slot the signal is an event the slot is an action that this widget is going to take when this signal occurs and well everybody that is an introduction to push buttons in pi qt5
Uvqmv3PGiXM,Python PyQt5 setup a basic GUI Application! 🖥️,2024-07-23T12:48:40Z,all right everybody in today's video we're going to get started working with the pi qd5 graphical user interface also known as a guey GUI in this topic we'll be creating a basic window so let's get started all right the first step is that using pip we're going to install the pi qt5 package open up a terminal both py charm and VSS code have a built-in terminal that you can use we're going to use pip that is Python's package manager pip install Pi qt5 enter and this might just take a second once your download has finished you should have a package within your site packages folder named Pi qt5 we can work with it as long as we import it first we are going to import the module of CIS CIS meaning system this module provides access to variables used and maintained by the python interpreter then from the package of Pi qt5 do pay attention to the capitalization it's easy to mess that up use dot to access the module of QT widgets widgets are the building blocks of a pi qt5 application they begin with Q that helps distinguish them from widgets from other libraries they typically begin with Q from this module import the following widgets Q application and Q main window here's some boiler plate code that we have to write in order to get this application up and running first we will create a class of main window which will inherit from the class of Cain window by inheriting from the parent of Cain window we can customize our own Windows to display to the user we will need a Constructor let's define that Define Dunder inet there will be no arguments currently besides self and in case we have to pass any arguments to the parent of Cain window we will access the super class that's the parent and call the parents Constructor but currently we don't have any arguments to pass in we will return to this class momentarily let's define a function of main When We Begin this program we will call the function of main to begin the application for now all right pass if we are running this file directly let's add the following if statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if we are running this file directly call the main function in order for us to begin if that's true we will call the function of main within the main function we will create an app object app equals we will call the Constructor for Q application that class but there's one argument that we have to pass in we will access our module of CIS do AR RGV meaning arguments so by passing in this argument this allows Pi QT to process any command line arguments intended for it that's if we use command prompt or terminal we won't be doing that in the series but you may someday in the future it would be a good idea for us to Future proof our code otherwise you may see people pass in an empty list so we now have an app object next we will create a window object window equals call The Constructor for our class of main window currently we don't have any arguments to pass in we have an app object and a window object by calling their respective Constructors now if I run this program currently our window is not going to show the default behavior for a window is to hide it in order to to show our window we will access our window call the show method to show it it's only going to appear for a brief second when I run this script I don't know if you saw it but it pops up for a brief second we need to ensure that the window stays until we interact with it or close it after we show our window we will access our module of CIS called the exit method the exit method method ensures a clean exit of our program within our exit method we will pass in as an argument our app object our app object has a built-in method of excore and this is a method so we can call it this is the execute method there is an underscore character after exec for execute that distinguishes it from the execute method there is a separate version of this execute function that ends with an underscore our apps execute method it waits around for user input and handles events such as if we click buttons press keys or close the window now that we're calling this method when we run our program this window should stay in place we can maximize it minimize it or close it that's all the boiler plate code that we need for a basic window let's customize it within our Constructor for our main window What would would we like to add let's set the title for our window self. set window title method we will pass in a string think of a title for your program my cool first GUI gooey and now we have a new title my cool first guey graphical user interface when this window appears we can can set the geometry of where the window appears and the size of the window access self dot set geometry method there's four arguments X and Y for the X and Y coordinates a width of the window and a height of the window if I were to set X and Y to be both zero this window will appear in the top left corner of my screen I'll also need a width and a height let let's say I don't know 500 for each so now my window is now a square the width and the height are both the same they're both 500 the width is 500 pixels the height is 500 pixels with the first two arguments we set the initial placement of our window to be where X is z and y is zero that corresponds to the top left corner if I set the first argument to be 100 well then the window window is going to move to the right by 100 pixels there are ways to Center your window in the very center of your screen but that's a little too advanced for us right now for the time being I'll pick something roughly near the middle of my screen 700 pixels on the x axis and 300 on the Y AIS it should appear roughly in the middle but feel free to adjust these values based on the size of your screen we'll discuss layouts in the future now if you would like a a window icon we can change that you will need an image to work with So within my project folder I have a profile picture for my YouTube channel I'll set that to be the icon find an image that you like then add it to your project folder in order to work with icons we'll need to make the following import from PI qt5 that's the package access the module of QT GUI import the following Q icon now we can work with icons after we set the geometry for our window access this object of self this main window call the method of set window icon within this method we will call the Constructor of Q icon we'll pass in either a relative file path or an absolute file path my main python file is right next to my profile picture that image I only need the file name within a string so the name of my image it's going to be different for you depending on what the name of your image is my image is named profile uncore pick and this image is a JPEG jpg then when I run this program I'm using my image as an icon for this window window all right everybody that is how to create a window using pi qt5 and in the next topic we will be creating some labeles
jS3vcRjY4Y8,MongoDB how to update documents,2024-07-22T12:36:02Z,well hello again everybody today I will be explaining how we can update documents in mongodb to do that we would type DB the name of the collection we're working with in this case students we can either update one document or update many let's update one we will use the update 1 method there are two parameters set up filter and update filter is the selection criteria for the update So within a set of curly braces we will pass some criteria let's update anybody's name that's SpongeBob it's basically just selection criteria the second parameter it's another document body is the update parameter what are the modifications we would like to apply we will utilize the set operator which is preceded with the dollar sign the set operator replaces the value of a field so after the set operator add a colon then another set of curly braces yes there's a lot of curly braces in mongodb So within this set of curly braces after the set operator that's where we can make our changes you can add or change the value of a field Spongebob doesn't have a full time field we can add that with the set operator if this field already exists we would update it so let's say SpongeBob is a full-time student let's execute this command it was acknowledged that's true we have a matched count of one and a modified count of one let's take a look at Spongebob DB dot students dot find name SpongeBob and here he is he is now a full-time student with your filter argument if you're working with a large data set it is possible that two people can have the same name it would be safer if we were to update by an object ID these IDs are unique for each document let's update but with the filter we will search by object ID so again that's Stevie dot students dot update one first is the filter parameter within a document body let's select underscore ID colon then paste that object ID for SpongeBob for every document the object ID is unique just in case there's two people named SpongeBob we won't update it uh looks like I have double underscore ID let me fix that real quick otherwise we'll get a syntax error so select the document that has this object ID then the second argument which is comma separated will be the changes to be made so we will set colon another set of curly braces let's set full time to be false SpongeBob already Works a full-time job he'll just be a part-time student okay that was acknowledged let's take a look at Spongebob again using the find method db.students.bind ID colon the unique object ID and here's SpongeBob the full-time field is set to false before it was true but we updated it now you can unset a field too let's get rid of the full time field for SpongeBob DB dot students dot update one we will search by ID then for the second argument we will use the unset operator which will remove a field so within another set of curly braces let's take our full time field colon now to remove a field for the value just set it to be an empty string let's take a look that was acknowledged let's select SpongeBob again db.students.find all right and here's SpongeBob again that full-time field is gone now you can use the unset operator to remove a field now let's talk about update many using the update many method we can update many documents at once DB dot students dot update many this method has the same parameters as update 1. if I would like to select every document I will use an empty set of curly braces what are the changes we would like to make let's use the set operator let's set everybody's full-time field to be false if they don't have this field one will be created for them all right let's find every student that was acknowledged db.students.find everybody should have a full-time field that's set to false full time is false here as well yeah and that applies to everybody all right let's unset the full-time field for Gary and Sandy TV DOT students dot update one let's select name Gary we will use the unset operator then add the changes to be made full time then we'll remove it by placing an empty string I'm going to copy this line we'll reuse it later that was acknowledged then let's remove full time for Sandy that was acknowledged as well so let's double check DB dot students dot find so SpongeBob and Patrick both have this full-time field Sandy and Gary don't they were on set with the update many method we can check to see if a field exists or doesn't exist within the selection criteria if any student doesn't have a full time field let's update it DB dot students.update many what is the selection criteria let's say the selection criteria is full time field does it not exist we will use the exists operator exists preceded with the dollar sign then add false does this full-time field not exist that's the selection criteria if a document doesn't have the full-time field we'll give them one so the second argument will be the changes to be made we will use the set operator colon another set of curly braces anybody that doesn't have the full-time field let's set that to be true full time true press enter that was acknowledged let's take a look at our students db.students.find all right so Sandy and Gary are both full-time students now SpongeBob Patrick and Larry are not full-time students they're part-time students that's how to update documents in the mongodb Shell you can use update 1 or update many let's do the same thing with compass hello again everybody in compass to update a field of a document you can press the pencil icon to edit the document to remove a field next to the field name you can press the trash can icon to remove it then update to add a field go to the pencil icon again after a field you can add a new field by pressing the plus button to add a field let's add a full time field for the value I will set that to be false for SpongeBob then you can change the data type here we'll change that to be a Boolean then update to change a pre-existing field again go to the pencil icon select your field then you can change one of the values but I'll keep this as false that is how to update documents in compass it's fairly easy and straightforward alright everybody so that is how to update documents in mongodb you can use the update 1 method or update many you pass in a filter for the selection criteria then the modifications within the update parameter and that is how to update documents in mongodb
6DoLxeMlVTI,MongoDB tutorial for beginners 🍃,2024-07-22T12:30:53Z,hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in today's video I'm going to teach you everything you need to know to get started using mongodb in about an hour so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey if you'd like free stuff you should probably subscribe because I release free courses every once in a while when I feel like it that is all what the heck is mongodb it's a no SQL database management system that can manage a humongous amount of data and it's becoming increasingly popular it's favored by many big tech companies unlike relational database Management Systems mongodb uses a nosql format to store and retrieve data nosql means not only SQL it's where data is stored in various formats besides a traditional SQL table rather than storing our data in rows and columns with the table using SQL we store related data as a single document think of each document as a single row and a table in SQL data in each document is stored as field value pairs similar to a Json format but it's technically bsawn binary JavaScript object notation but it behaves very simple similarly for all intents and purposes the general idea is that data which is frequently accessed together is stored together rather than in Separate Tables because SQL joins quite frankly are a pain in the ass this is how our nosql database is arranged we have a document a document is a group of field value pairs to represent an object a collection is a group of one or more documents and a database is a group of one or more collections this makes working with and scaling our database like really really easy before we do begin there are a few prerequisites for this series we will be working with document objects I would recommend at least some experience with an object-oriented programming language of your choosing it doesn't matter if it's python Java C plus plus C sharp JavaScript doesn't matter just pick one so let's get started I will show you what you need to download all right let's get started everybody here is the installation process for mongodb so go to this website mongodb.com go to resources server on the left sidebar go to installation here's a list of different installation tutorials depending on your operating system I'm running Windows I'll select Windows let's scroll down we're looking for install mongodb Community Edition all you have to do is follow the numbered steps beginning with one we will go to the download Center I'll open this in a new tab because I don't want to close out of this window select the current version select your platform again I'm running Windows and the installation package I'll keep that the same and download pick a place to save the installer to I'll keep it within my documents folder but you choose your own place and I will open this when it's done so we're going to click next up the license agreement next complete install mongod as a service make sure that's checked next also be sure to install the mongodb compass program it's a graphical user interface then give it a couple minutes now that mongodb is installed we can finish this may open compass compass is a graphical user interface for managing our database we'll be using Compass intermittently in fact I recommend creating a desktop shortcut you just have to open it then to establish a connection you hit the green connect button I'll be using Compass intermittently just to show you how everything works let's also install the mongodb shell to install the shell we're going to go to the left sidebar and where is it there mongodb shell also known as mangosh like oh my gosh we are going to go to the download Center select the current version select your platform I'm running Windows and the package will keep that the same and download we'll open this when it's done we will unzip this folder so right click extract all we will need the file pass to the executable let's open this folder go to bin and we can copy this file location let's right click on our executable go to properties copy this file location it should be within the bin folder then we're going to add that file path to our environment variables really we can just search for environment variables we're within system properties go to the advanced tab environment variables underneath system variables let's pretend that this wasn't here click new come up with a variable name sh is good then paste that file location hit okay and close so if we go to that folder and open the executable this is the mongodb shell I'm going to make the font size a little bit bigger to establish a connection to our database type sh and that should establish a connection to clear your screen type CLS to exit type exit personally I don't like using this executable by itself I like using vs code if you would like to use vs code for using the Shell here's how if you would like to use vs code for using the Shell here's how So within vs code we're going to download the mongodb extension so go to extensions search for mongodb it should be this one we will install this extension there should be a new icon for mongodb let's click on it to establish a connection we just have to click on localhost the mongodb connection was successful then to open our terminal right click launch mongodb shell let's minimize this close out of this window pull up this terminal we are utilizing the mongodb Shell with vs code so to exit you type exit to establish a connection you can type  sh to clear your screen you can type CLS and that is everything you need to know to get started
JVQNywo4AbU,Request API data using Python in 8 minutes! ↩️,2024-07-17T13:00:26Z,hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can connect to an API using python in this demonstration we're going to connect to the Poke API to get some information on a Pokémon of our choosing I'm assuming that most of us are familiar with Pokémon I thought it'd be a fun example so according to this API we can look up a Pokémon such as Pikachu then we can get the stats for Pikachu such as Pikachu's name height ID number and all sorts of moves and abilities that a Pikachu may have we will need this URL but we'll handle that later our first step is that we're going to import the requests library to make an API request however when I run this I have a module not found error no module named requests requests is one package will have to install it's not normally included with the standard python download if I was to go to my folder go to my virtual environment library site packages there is no package for requests we'll have to download that with pycharm and vs code there is a built-in terminal that we can use to download the request package we can use pip pip is a package manager for python it's normally included when you install python we'll type pip install requests it'll take just a second and now we have that package of requests within our project folder if I run this again that error goes away process finished with exit Code Zero that means there were no errors going back to our Pokemon API we will need this URL let me zoom in so you can see it I'm going to store that as a base URL so it's easier to work with for convenience I'm going to create a function name get Pokemon info to get some info on a Pokémon we'll have to pass in the name of a Pokemon for now I'll write pass outside of this function let's say we have a variable of Pokemon name pick a Pokemon I will pick Pikachu for now then I will call the get Pokemon info function then pass in my Pokémon name remember that your parameters can be named different than your arguments when you send data to a function you can rename it to something else temporarily now that we have the name of the Pokémon we would like to look up we can complete the URL this will be an F string so with our Pokemon API we have the base URL followed by the word Pokemon then the name of a Pokemon so we have the basee URL I'll add a placeholder and insert it forward slash the word Pokemon slash the name of that Pokémon in this example it's going to be Pikachu we now have the full URL we'll access the request module use the get method and pass in that URL this method is going to return a response object which I will assign to response response is a response object and I'm just going to print our response just to see what we're working with here's our response object it has a status code this is an HTTP status code of 200 200 means the response was okay here's a few examples of response codes you're probably familiar with 404 not found so we are looking for 200 the response is okay after we get our response I'll add an if statement if our response our response object does have an attribute of status code to read what the status code is if this status code is equal to 200 that means the response is okay but for now I'll write pass else I'm going to print the following else I'm going to print failed to retrieve data and I will print the status code of the response object so temporarily I will print data retrieved if it was successful I can't spell okay we have our data data was retrieved if our status code of our response object is equal to 200 I will take our response object and use the Json method our response is a Json format using this method we'll convert it to a python dictionary it will consist of key value pairs much like a Json file but I'm going to assign that to a variable of Pokemon data so it's easier to work with then I will print our Pokemon data so here's the data on Pikachu it's really difficult to read all this you can see some keywords we have abilities base experience this is an extremely large dictionary once we have our dictionary I will return that dictionary of Pokemon data back to the place where we called this function and I will store that as a variable Pokemon info equals get Pokemon info pass in a Pokemon's name and now we should have a dictionary that we can work with let me zoom out if our dictionary exists we can use the if keyword if Pokémon info if that's true if it exists this will be true I will print the following I'll use an F string to access the value of a dictionary we can access it by a key we'll take our dictionary of Pokemon info access the key of name let's see what happens exactly we get Pikachu let's get Pikachu's ID number we will access the key of ID the given value is 25 Pikachu is the 25th Pokemon in the franchise let's get Pikachu's height Pikachu's height is four I don't know what unit of measurement they use in that franchise 4et or 4 Ines I don't know let's get Pikachu's weight Pikachu's weight is 60 60 lb 60 kog I don't know just to make this look nice I'm going to add Name ID height and weight that looks much better let's pick a different Pokemon I will pick my favorite Pokemon of tyion failed to retrieve data does that have to be a lowercase yes it does okay so name tyan I'll follow the name with the capitalize method to make it capital there we go so my favorite Pokemon is tyan ID is 157 Ty loan's height is 17 and weight is 795 all right everybody that is one way in which we can connect to an API using python also tell tell me what your favorite Pokémon is in the comment section down below
IljPHDyBRog,Learn Python LAMBDA in 6 minutes! 🚮,2024-07-14T14:00:14Z,yo what's going on everybody so today I'm going to discuss Lambda functions in Python a Lambda function is a small anonimous function for a onetime use then we throw them away they take any number of arguments but only have one expression a few of the benefits of Lambda functions is that they help keep the namespace clean because we don't have to think of a unique name for that function we're only going to use it once we don't need to give it a name and they're useful with something called higher order functions which we still need to talk about there sort map filter and reduce for example here's an example of a Lambda function that you may see within a map method we have Lambda our parameters colon our expression I haven't talked about the map function yet a Lambda function is a function you would commonly see within the map function a higher order function but that's a topic for a future video in this video we're going to focus more on the syntax of Lambda functions so what we'll do is we will create a variable let's say double we'll write a Lambda function to double a number following this formula we have to type the keyword Lambda to specify that this is a Lambda function we have our parameters we will accept one parameter which we will name X colon then a oneline expression let's say with X I would like to double it x * 2 so what we're doing is we're assigning a Lambda function to a variable although you could assign a Lambda function to a variable that's not the primary use of them you would more likely see Lambda functions within higher order functions like I said we're just covering the syntax of a Lambda function with this variable of double it contains a function meaning we can call it to demonstrate that I'm going to print my double variable since it contains a function within it we can call it we have to pass in one AR arent let's say two we will double two and print the result which gives me four if I were to double three that would give me six if I doubled four that gives me eight with Lambda functions we can have any number of arguments this time we'll create two arguments we will assign a variable of ADD and add two numbers together with a Lambda function Lambda our parameters are X comma y colon then expression let's add X and Y together x + y I will take my variable of add it contains a function within it I can call it but I have to pass in two arguments for X and Y let's add two and three then we have to print it in order to see it and the result is five let's write a more complicated expression we'll find the greater of two numbers I will create a variable of max value equals again following this formula Lambda then we need the parameters we'll compare two numbers X and Y we return x if x is greater than y else we will return y this is similar to a list comprehension I will print take my variable of max value call the Lambda function that's within it pass in two numbers what is the greater number between four and five five what about six and five well we get six okay let's do the opposite let's find the minimum value we have X and Y return x if x is less than y else Y what is the minimum value between 6 and 7 6 what about between 8 and 7 seven we'll create a Lambda function to concatenate a string I will create a variable of full name equals Lambda we will have two parameters first meaning first name and last meaning last name we'll take our first name first plus a space plus the last last name I will print our full name variable call the Lambda function that's within it passing a first name and a last name I will pick SpongeBob last name SquarePants this will give me a full name of SpongeBob space SquarePants all one long string because we're using string catenation using a Lambda function we can check to see if a number is even I will create a variable of is even this will give us a Boolean Lambda X will be the parameter X modulus 2 modulus gives you the remainder of any Division if x is divisible by two that means there is going to be no remainder we can check to see if that is equal to zero so I will print our is even variable call the Lambda function that's within it let's see if the number four is even four divides by two evenly that's true but what about five that's false Let's do an age verification check I will create a variable of age check equals Lambda we have one parameter of age I will return true if our age is greater than or equal Al to 18 else we will return false I will print our age check variable and pass in 21 that returns true but what about 12 that returns false all right everybody so those are Lambda functions they're small Anonymous functions for a one-time use they take any number of arguments but only have one expression using Lambda functions helps keep the space clean because we don't need to constantly think of different function names especially within a larger program and they're extremely useful with something called higher order functions such as sort map filter and reduce which we'll be covering in the next few videos and well everybody those are Lambda functions in Python
V_NXT2-QIlE,Learn Python EXCEPTION HANDLING in 5 minutes! 🚦,2024-06-29T14:00:22Z,hey everybody so today I got to talk about exception handling in Python an exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program there are many different types of exceptions which include but are not limited to zero division error exceptions when you attempt to divide a number by zero for example 1 / 0 that would interrupt our program we have a zero division error another is a type error that's if we attempt to perform an operation of a value that's of the wrong data type for example 1 plus a string of one that would give us a type error unsupported operand for INT and string value errors tend to happen when you attempt to typ cast a value of the wrong data type so let's say we attempt to typ cast the word Pizza as an integer well Pizza isn't a number we have a value error invalid literal for INT base with 10 pizza so exceptions will interrupt our program if they not handled gracefully and here's how we can do that there's three steps we can write a try accept and finally block any code that's dangerous where it could cause an error you'll place within a tri block for example anytime we accept user input that is considered dangerous code because a user can type in anything so let's say we have a number number equals we will accept some user input we will tell a user to enter to a number then we're going to typ cast it as an integer then I'm going to print 1 divided by whatever the user types in if I were to type in zero we get a zero division error if I type in the word Pizza we get a value error we would like to prevent our program from stopping this code is considered dangerous a user can really type in anything so we're going to surround this code within a tri block we'll type try colon and then indent any code underneath it we're going to try this code if an exception happens we will move on to step two subsequently following the tri block we will add an accept block if we run into one of these exceptions we can execute some alternative code for example a zero division error if some attempts to divide a number by zero we can take a different course of action instead of our program crashing and coming to a halt let's print you can't divide by zero idiot let's attempt to divide by zero enter a number zero you can't divide by zero idiot we have gracefully handled this exception so now let's say somebody typ types in the word Pizza when we're asking for a number well we have a value error well we can chain accept blocks if we encounter a value error let's add an accept block for that accept value error we're going to print enter only numbers please enter a number I'll type in the word Pizza enter only numbers pleas please that's good we're not interrupting our program now what you may see some people do is they will just catch all exceptions except exception now this is actually considered bad practice exception will catch all exceptions however it's too broad of a clause it's good practice to tell the user what went wrong exactly if we resort to just catching all exceptions you may see an error message such as something went wrong I'm looking at you Microsoft we want to tell the user what went wrong exactly I would only catch all exceptions as a last resort first let's try and tell the user what went wrong exactly so I'm going to undo all this code if there's an exception that occurs it's not a zero division error and it's not a value error then we can add that catchall where we catch any unseen exceptions now lastly we have the finally block the finally block always executes regardless if there's an exception or not it's usually used for any sort of cleanup that you need to do such as if you're handling files you may try and open a file and then you'll want to be sure to close that file when you're done with it that would be handled within the finally block but we'll get to file handling pretty soon in the next topic so just for the time being I'm going to print do some cleanup here all right let's test this enter a number I'm going to divide by zero you can't divide by zero and we still execute the finally block enter a number I'll enter in one 1 / 1 is 1 and we still execute that finally block the finally block will be more useful in future videos all you need to know is that it always executes regardless if there's an exception or not all right everybody so that's exception handling an exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program there are many different types of exceptions you can always look under the official python documentation for an extensive list and well everybody that's exception handling in Python
Qe03kCuTMoU,Learn Python DUCK TYPING in 4 minutes! 🦆,2024-06-25T14:00:31Z,hey everybody so today I got to talk about duck typing in Python duck typing is another way to achieve polymorphism besides using inheritance objects can be treated as if they're a different type as long as they meet the minimum necessary attributes and methods required of them it follows this adage if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it must be a duck as long as an object resembles another it could also be treated of that type so in this example let's create a CL CL of animal we will have a class attribute of aive if you're an animal you will have an attribute of alive you're a living creature let's create a class of dog the dog class will inherit from the animal class they will inherit the alive attribute let's also Define a speak method if you're a dog you gain the ability to speak we will print woof then we'll create a cat class class cat inherits from animal for the speak method we will print meow let's create a list of animals what do these two classes have in common they both could be considered animals let's create a list of animals we will construct a dog object and a cat object if I was to write a for Loop for every animal in my list of animals have each animal use its speak method which will result in the dog going woof the cat going meow they're both speaking what if we add a class that has nothing to do with animals like class car cars will have a horn method that's how they speak when you honk the horn you you will print honk within my list of animals let's create a car object it really doesn't belong in here but let's see what happens we have an attribute error car object has no attribute speak our car object doesn't have the minimum necessary attributes and methods when iterating through this list of animals we're calling each animal speak method which our car object doesn't have but it does have a horn method so what if we rename our horn method as speak maybe it's an AI car or something well this would work the dog goes woof the cat goes meow the car goes honk so our car object it quacks like a duck we could consider it a duck it has the minimum necessary methods to be considered an animal animals inherit this alive attribute let's utilize that after the animal speaks let's print their Al live attribute print my animals alive attribute my car object doesn't have that attribute we get an attribute error car object has no attribute alive but if I was to add that attribute alive false we have true for the dog it's living true for the cat it's living but false for the car it's not living it's not a living creature my car meets the minimum necessary requirements to be considered an animal if I were to set this to be alive well then it would be a living car kind of like the movie Cars so with python duck typing is another another way to achieve polymorphism besides using inheritance as long as an object has the minimum necessary attributes and methods you could treat it as a different type of object if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it must be a duck and well everybody that is duck typing in Python
TPUdUkFHD5I,Learn Python COMPOSITION in 7 minutes! 🚘,2024-06-19T14:00:32Z,all right everybody so today I got to talk about composition in python as we've discussed in the previous topic aggregation is a relationship where one object contains references to other independent objects they have a has a relationship composition on the other hand is when the composed object directly owns its components which cannot exist independently they have a owns a relationship aggregation has things composition owns things kind of like you're renting or you're owning something in this example we'll create three classes a class of engine a class of wheel and the composed object is going to be Class Car within our car class we will construct some engine and wheel objects we'll begin with our engine class we'll need a Constructor we'll Define that def fine in knit let's say that with an engine we need a horsepower what is the power of the engine self. horsepower attribute equals the horsepower that we receive with our class of wheel we need a Constructor Define init let's add a size attribute what is the size of the wheel self. size equal size okay now with our car object now within our car class we need a Constructor we will need a make model the horsepower of the engine and size we'll say wheel size remember that you can rename parameters to something different we will assign these attributes self. make equal make self. model equals model here's where composition comes in we will define an attribute of engine then call the engine Constructor we have one argument to pass in Horsepower we will pass in the horsepower that we receive to the engine Constructor then we have to set up our Wheels self. Wheels equals now to construct a single wheel object we would call the wheel Constructor then pass in the wheel size however cars have four wheels we don't want just one wheel so what we could do is write a list comprehension for every wheel in range four to iterate four times let's call the wheel constru structor and pass in our wheel size this list comprehension will create four wheel objects for us the reason that this is considered composition we're creating engine and wheel objects inside of this class car our class car owns an engine and owns four wheels we're not creating these objects outside of the car class let's create a car object car equals car we need a make model horsepower for the engine and wheel size so for my car let's say Ford Mustang for the horsepower I'll make up something 500 for the wheel size 18 in now just to make this more explicit I'm going to use keyword arguments but you don't have to so make equals Ford Model equals Mustang horsepower equal 500 wheel size equals 18 let's create a method to display our car I would like the details Define display car no parameters let's return an F string let's begin with the making model those will be easy display self. make and self model let's take our car object use the display car method then I got to print it I forgot because we're returning a string we're not printing it directly we have a Ford Mustang okay let's display the horsepower there's one additional step we are accessing self this car that we're creating but now we need the engine let's access the engine attribute and now with our engine our engine has an attribute of horsepower we'll use the attribute accessor that dot horsepower 500 I'll add HP meaning horsepower all right now for the wheels I'll add another placeholder access self access our Wheels now our Wheels it's a list I don't need all four wheels I just need one if I was to take my list then access the size this is what it'll give me list object has no attribute size so we need to access one of the elements of our list of Wheels let's just say the first wheels at index zero then give me the size 18 and that's going to be inches all right then let's create a second car object before we finish we have car 1 Car 2 equals car we need a make model horsepower for the engine and wheel size for the wheels I will pick a Chevrolet Corvette and I'm just going to make up some numbers the horsepower is 670 and the wheel size is 19 let's display Car 2 Car 2 called the display car method we have a Chevy Corvette with horsepower of 670 the wheel size is 19 in so our car class it owns some objects it owns an engine and it owns four wheels that's why composition is different from aggregation if I were to delete these two cars this engine and the four wheels would stop existing whereas in our library example in the last video If I Was to delete the library object the books would still exist all right everybody so that's composition it's where a composed object our car directly owns its components our car owns an engine and it owns four wheels we're creating them within the class and well everybody that's composition in Python
8aW3tkIul-8,Let&#39;s code a beginners Python BANKING PROGRAM 💰,2024-05-30T15:37:01Z,"hey what's going on everybody so in this video we're going to create a very simple banking program using python this is meant to be more of an exercise to get us used to working with functions when creating a project I like to divide that project into smaller sections then handle them one at a time so we'll do that by declaring all the functions we'll need first with the banking program we'll need to show a user their balance we'll Define a function to show balance for the time being I'll write pass just as a placeholder we'll need to make a deposit Define deposit make a withdrawal Define withdraw near the end of this project we will be creating a main function and placing the main body of our code within it we'll handle that near the end just to contain everything we have our three functions with our banking program we'll need to show a balance make a deposit or make a withdrawal what if some variables we'll need well we'll need a balance which I will set to be zero initially I will also create a Boolean of is running this will be true if at any time we set is running to be false we'll exit the program so with the majority of our code we'll place it within a while loop while is running you can check to see if this is equal to true but since this is a Boolean that's not necessary we will just just say while is running if is running becomes false we'll exit the while loop within our while loop we'll print some sort of Welcome message let's print banking program then list some options let's print one show balance to deposit three will be withdraw for will be exit afterwards we will set a choice variable to equal some user input input enter your choice 1 through 4 We're encouraging a user to type in a number 1 through 4 to select an option do they want to show their balance make a deposit make a withdrawal or exit We'll add a few if and else if statements let's check to see if the user's choice is equal to one that is a string of one our user input is a string data type unless we were to typ cast it to something else if our choice is equal to one we will call call the function to show balance else if our choice is equal to two we will make a deposit by calling the deposit function else if choice is equal to three we will call the withdrawal function else if choice is equal to 4 that means we would like to exit so we need to exit this while loop we can do that by setting our variable of is running is this program running equal to be false to exit if somebody types in some input that's not valid we can handle that with an else statement else let's print that is not a valid Choice okay let's see what we're working with currently to test everything we haven't written anything within these functions yet show balance deposit or withdraw so we can type one 2 three and four to exit processed finished with exit Code Zero so we can't exit the program we just have to select option four with this else statement this will execute if we type in something besides the numbers 1 through 4 because there's no other options left so to test that enter your choice Choice 1 through 4 uh I'm just going to type the word poo that is not a valid choice so we know that the else statement is working once we exit the while loop let's print a message that says thank you have a nice day if I was to type four to exit we should exit the program thank you have a nice day let's make that h capital now we'll work on our functions beginning with show balance currently these two variables are Global we don't need to pass them as a parameter to these functions quite yet we will be enclosing all of this code within a main function we'll handle that later though so with show balance all we're going to do is print I'll use an F string your balance is add a dollar sign or other unit of currency of you're choosing add a placeholder our balance variable and let's see what we have I will type one to show balance your balance is 0 I'll display our balance with two decimal places after I will add a format specifier after balance colon. 2f will add two decimal places we covered format specifiers in a previous topic so if I were to run this again type one we show $0 and 0 cents we're displaying two floating Point decimal places now we need to make a deposit that'll be the next function we will Define a local variable of amount equals accept some user input enter an amount to be deposited again when we accept user input it's a string we'll typ cast it to a number a floating Point number because we have to include dollars and cents we'll add some checks though after accepting some user input if our amount is greater than zero we don't want anybody to make a negative deposit let's print that's not a valid amount else we are going to return our amount so this function is going to return something so within our else if statement we will take our balance plus equals the deposit we're being returned with this will add our deposit to our balance balance balance plus equals deposit let's try it let's show our balance our balance is $0 we'll make a deposit of $100 exactly again we'll show our balance after making the deposit your balance is $100 let's attempt to deposit negative money we'll select two to make a deposit we'll deposit negative $420 69 that's not a valid amount so we have a problem we have a type error unsupported operand for float and nonone type so within this statement within if within our deposit function we're not returning anything let's just return zero we have to return something and within this if statement we didn't return anything previously we'll either return zero or return a valid amount let's try this again let's make a deposit I will attempt to deposit 42069 that's not a valid amount our program is not crashing that's good now we'll attempt to make a valid deposit $501 then show my balance your balance is $501 okay that is the deposit it function we'll work on the withdraw function next we will create a local variable of amount accept some user input enter amount to be withdrawn our user input is going to be a string we will typ cast it to be a floating Point number we need to check to see if our amount we're trying to withdraw is greater than our balance users shouldn't be able to withdraw more money than what they have in their bank account if the amount is greater than our balance that we have we will print insufficient funds else if the amount somebody's trying to withdraw is less than zero we will print a different message amount must be greater than zero else we will return our valid amount so with our if and else if statements we do need to return something if we take one of these routes we will return zero we're not making any any changes within our else if statement where we select choice three we're going to take our balance minus equals the withdraw amount let's test this banking program let's show our balance our balance is zero we'll make a deposit of $100 show my balance again your balance is $100 let's press three to withdraw money enter amount to be withdrawn one1 kajillion dollar insufficient funds yeah no kidding Let's attempt to withdraw money again we shouldn't be able to select a negative amount negative $420 69 amount must be greater than zero let's enter in a valid number this time I would like to withdraw $49.99 that has appeared to work we'll show our balance again your balance is now $501 then we can exit by pressing four to exit thank you and have a nice day the last few changes I'm going to make is that I'm going to enclose all of this code our main portion of code within a main function just to encapsulate all of our variables and help with readability we will Define a function of main take all of our code within the main body of our program and place it within the function I'm just going to select all of it and indent it at the end of our program we need to call a main function to run it if you're familiar with the statement of if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main that means this program can be imported or run stand alone it is good practice to include this if statement we discussed this in the pr previous video if we're running this program directly execute the main function however our variables of balance and is running they're now enclosed within this local scope these other functions have no idea what these variables are of balance so we need to pass in our balance to those functions of withdraw and show balance when we show our balance we have to pass in our variable of balance same thing with withdraw then set up those parameters within show balance we will have one parameter of balance the same thing with withdraw the last thing I'm going to do is add a little bit of text decoration around my program just to make it look nice so I will print a bunch of asterisks it's not necessary but I think it'll look nice let's add some text decoration before and after the title of banking program also before our choice basically whenever we print anything We'll add some text decoration let's do that with show balance our deposit and within withdraw okay let's run this one last time banking program let's show our balance your balance is 0 we'll make a deposit $100 and 1ent show our balance again your balance is $100 And1 we will withdraw money enter an amount to be withdrawn $1,000 insufficient funds let's try that again let's withdraw $50 show our balance again $501 then press for to exit thank you and have a nice day all right everybody that is a simple banking program you can write using python on"
8A0E1dSyjFM,if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39; for Python beginners 📥,2024-05-27T16:42:51Z,hey everybody so today I got to talk about this if statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main when you see this if statement it's usually followed by a call to a function named main or something similar a majority of the driving code behind a program is usually found within some sort of main method when you see this if statement basically speaking it means that this script can be imported or it can run Standalone functions and classes in this module can be reused in other programs without the main block of code running sometimes you would like the functionality of a program without executing the main body of code a good example could be a library in a python Library we would like to import some of the useful functions such as the math module but if we were to run that Library directly instead of importing it we could instead display a help page but if we're importing that Library we don't necessarily want to display that help page only if we're running it directly in many python scripts you'll see the statement of if Dunder name is equal to main if we're not running this program directly don't do it in this example we're going to delete our main python script be sure to recreate it at the end of this topic in case I forget to mention that we will create two new scripts go to file new python file script one file new python file script 2 we have to add new run configurations for script one and script 2 so if you go to the top go to run edit configurations we will add a new run configuration select python select a new script path to script one okay apply again we have to do this with script 2 add python select a script path of script 2 okay apply then okay using this drop down menu we can select which run configuration we would like would we like to run our main python file but we have deleted it do we want to run script one or script two for the time being we'll select script one within script one if I was to print then call the dur function dur meaning directory python has all of these built-in attributes if you're not familiar with object oriented programming for now think of an attribute as a variable Dunder name is a special type of variable Dunder meaning double uncore if I was to print what's contained within Dunder name we would receive a string of Dunder main that's why in a script you may see the statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if so then you usually call a function named main to start your program I'm going to undo that so let's import script 2 from script 2 import everything asterisk means everything within script 2 I will print Dunder name and we'll see what's within it again I'm running script one within script two Dunder name is equal to a string of script 2 the name of the Python script however within script one Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main this means I am running script one directly let's delete this import then go to script two import script one from script One Import asterisk meaning all we're now going to change our run configuration from script 1 to script 2 we are running script 2 directly now Dunder name within script one is the name of the Python script script one Dunder name within script 2 is now Dunder main so by adding this if statement of Dunder name is equal to Dunder main we can check to see which file is being run directly if Dunder name equals Dunder main we will call a function of main to contain the main body of our program but we need to Define this function define main our main function will contain the majority of our python code anything that's not already within a function so let's print this is script one then we'll Define another function of favorite food we will have one print of food let's print the following message I'll use an F string your favorite food is add a placeholder add our parameter of food within our main function let's call the favorite food function pass in your favorite food as a string I'll type in pizza then let's print the word goodbye we're going to run script one run it here's the result from the top down all of our code is within functions we skip over it because we're not calling it quite yet the first thing we do in this program is check this if statement if Dunder name is equal to Dunder main are we running this program directly which we are we're running script one if so call the main method to start the program we print this is script one your favorite food is pizza goodbye now I'm going to go to script 2 delete our print statement change the Run configuration to script 2 and run it nothing should happen that's good now if we were missing this if statement of if Dunder name is equal to main then we delete our main function here's what would happen we're importing script one but we're running script 2 this is script one your favorite food is pizza goodbye I don't want this code to execute we're not running it directly that's why we have that if statement if under name is equal to main I only want to run this code if we're running it directly so what we'll do within script 2 now is Define a function of favorite drink there's one parameter of drink I will print use an FST string your favorite drink is I'll add a placeholder we'll add our parameter of drink let's print the message this is script 2 we will call from script one the favorite food function pass in your favorite food this time I'll say Sushi let's call our favorite drink function favorite drink I'll pass in coffee then we will print goodbye okay we are running script two this is script 2 your favorite food is Sushi your favorite drink is coffee goodbye we're running script 2 but we're importing the functionality of the favorite food function from script one sometimes from another python script you want to borrow something but you don't want to run the main body of code directly I just want to borrow this function from script one and that's it script 2 can be run as a standalone program but I can't import it without this body of code running I can add that if statement if Dunder name is equal to a string of Dunder main if we're running this program directly execute this code so let's call a function of main Define main then Place main body of code within it if I run script 2 we have the same message so by adding this if statement of if name is equal to main this script can be run as a standalone program or it can be imported a more practical example of this could be a python Library you can import the library for functionality but if you run the library directly you could instead display a help page it is good practice to include if Dunder name equals Dunder main it makes your code more modular helps with readability leaves no Global variables and avoid unintended execution and well everybody that is the purpose of if Dunder name equals Dunder Main in Python
TYyKQBC4bwE,Learn conditional expressions in 5 minutes! ❓,2024-05-25T15:18:01Z,hey everybody so today I got to explain conditional expressions in Python a conditional expression is a oneline shortcut for using an IFL statement if you're familiar with other programming languages this is also known as the tary operator it behaves similarly using conditional Expressions we can print or assign one of two values based on a condition here's the formula return X if our condition is true else return y here's a basic example we will create a variable for number just num let's say our number is five I'm going to print then within our print statement I will write a conditional expression following this formula I'll just copy and paste it let's check to see if our number is positive let's print the text positive if our condition what are we checking let's check to see if num is greater than zero that means it's positive if this condition is false we will instead print whatever comes after else else negative number is five that will print positive if our number was Nega five well this condition would be false we would instead print negative let's go over another let's check to see if our number is even or odd let's set numb to be six this time I will assign the result to a variable our result equals take our formula let's assign even if our num modulus 2 is our number divisible by two does that equal zero else return odd then let's print our result result number six that is even if it's five then it's odd assign even if our number is divisible by two else return odd let's create variables A and B A will equal 6 B will equal 7 let's create a variable of Max num equals follow our formula again return variable a if a is greater than b else return B between A and B which is the maximum number that would be B of seven let's find the minimum this time Min num a if a is less than b else return B the minimum number between six and seven is six this time we'll take an age age equals 25 we will create a variable of status equals use our formula again return a string of adult if our age is greater than or equal to 18 else return a string of child then we will print our status our age is 25 that's greater than or equal to 18 we will print adult if our age was 13 then we are a child we will instead return child let's work with the temperature temperature equals 30° C so that's hot let's create a variable of weather assign a string of hot if our temperature is greater than 20 else we will return a string of cold what's the weather outside today based on the temperature it is hot if our temperature was 20 then the weather is cold okay last example we will work with a user role I will set this to be admin we will Define a variable of access level equals again follow our formula return the text of full access if our condition of user role is equal to a string of admin else we will return limited access our user role is an admin let's print our access level and we have full access but what if we were a guest well then we have limited access all right everybody those are conditional Expressions they're a oneline shortcut for the if else statement it's similar to the tary operator and other programming languages using conditional Expressions we can print or assign one of two values based on a condition you follow the formula of return X if our condition is true else return y if it's false and well everybody those are a few examples of condition expressions in Python
HzyhmZqiaE8,SUPER() in Python explained! 🔴,2024-05-24T15:39:00Z,hey everybody so today I got to talk about the super function in Python super is a function it's used within a child class to call methods from a parent class the child class is the subass the parent class is the super class hence why this function is named the super function using the super function it allows you to extend the functionality of the inherited methods here's an example we'll create a few shape objects we'll need to set up the classes though we'll have class Circle for the time being I'll just write pass we'll fill it in later class square and class triangle for each of these classes in order to instantiate objects we'll need a Constructor we will Define our Constructor our init method when creating circles what sorts of attributes should a circle have let's say a color what's the color of the circle is it filled or not filled will be another attribute and a radius then let's assign these self. color equals the color that we receive self. filed equals filled self. radius equals radius let's do this with the square and triangle really I'll just copy our Constructor and paste it squares don't have a radius with a square the width and the height are the same let's replace radius with width we'll also keep the color and filled attributes self. width equals width now with triangles again let's copy our Constructor we'll need a width and a height self. height equals height so with programming we try not to repeat ourselves if we don't have to what do all of these classes have in common they all share the attributes of color and filled the ways in which they are different is that Circle has a radius attribute square has a width triangle has a width and a height if we have to make any changes to one of these attributes we would have to do so manually for example let's replace filled with isil now I need to look throughout my code for any instance of filled and replace it with is filled it's a lot of work and I might make a mistake such as here and here it's better to write your code once and try and reuse it so that's where inheritance and the super function can come in handy we're going to take the attributes of color and is filled and place it within app parent class these children classes will inherit those attributes so class what do they all have in common they're all shapes class shape and for now I'll write pass circle is going to inherit from its parent of shape that also applies with square and triangle we'll set up a Constructor for shape Define init we will pass in the color and is filled then we will assign these add attributes self. color equals color self. is filled equals is filled we don't need to manually assign these attributes within each of these Constructors for the children instead what we have to do is within the Constructor for each of these children classes we have to call the Constructor for the parent also known as the super class of shape so we will eliminate these two lines of code use the super function dot call The Constructor of the parent that is the dunder init method but we need to pass in the color that we receive and is filled this will be a Boolean and let's do this with the square class and the triangle class we still need radius for the circle width for the square width and height for the triangle we're going to call the super function to take care of whatever our attributes all these types of shapes have in common such as color and is filled now let's see if this works let's construct a few objects we will create a circle named Circle call The Constructor for Circle we have to pass in a color a Boolean if it's filled or not and a radius so for the color of the circle let's say red is filled let's say that is true and a radius of five you could even use keyword arguments for better readability although not necessary but for clarity let's say color equals red is filled equals true radius equals 5 let's see if this works I will print our circles color it is red print our colors is filled attribute the circle is filled that is true and the radius print circle. rius the radius of the circle is five we could even convert this to an F string I'll add a placeholder then add centimeters 5 cm let's construct a square object square equals Square we'll need a color is filled and a width I'll just copy what we have and make a few changes replace radius with width the color will be blue is filled will be false the width will be six we don't need a height because squares have an even width and height if we ever need the height we can assume it's the same as the width in this case six let's check out our square square do color Square do is filled Square do width our square is blue it's not filled in the width is 6 cm let's create a triangle object triangle equals triangle pass in our arguments the color will be yellow is filled will be true the width will be seven and the height will be eight let's print our triangle's color is it filled its width and its height our triangle is yellow it's filled in the width is 7 cm the height is 8 cm so that's how you can use the super function to reuse the Constructor of a parent CL class we don't need to manually assign each of these attributes within each of the children classes we can do that in just one place when we refer to Super imagine that we're replacing this with the parent class name such as shape that might be a good way to think of it use the Constructor of the parent class of shape and pass these arguments in what you could do as well is extend the functionality of a method So within our shape class let's create a method of describe we will describe the attributes of this shape we will print use an FST string when we want to describe our shape let's say it is at a placeholder self. color what is the color of this shape and is it fil or not and add a placeholder we'll use a tary operator print filled if self. is filled is true else we will print not filled each of these types of shapes circle square and triangle will have access to a describe method let's attempt to use it take our Circle use the describe method that's inherited it is red and filled Square it is blue and not filled triangle it is yellow and filled so then we also have method overwriting what if we create a similar method of describe within circle square and triangle let's do that Define a describe method within our Circle let's calculate the area what's the area of the circle I'll use an F string it is a circle with an area of then we'll calculate the area given the radius to calculate the area of a circle we can take Pi I'll just say 3.14 just to keep it simple times the radius squared self. rius time self. rius if I were to call the describe method will we use the parents version of describe or the child so let's take our Circle use the describe method the result it is a circle with an area of 78.5 I should really add cenim squar after that cm squared this is called method overwriting if a child shares a similar method with a parent you'll use the child's version and not the parents this is Method overwriting if you would like to extend the functionality of a method from a parent you can use the super function not only do I want to use the describe method of the child I would also like to use the describe method of the parent So within this function we will use the super function access the describe method of the parent what we're doing is extending the functionality of the describe method if it is a circle with an area of 78.5 cm squared the circle is red and it's filled or you can change up the order let's use the parent classes describe method and extend the functionality with our own print statement it is red and filled it is a circle with an area of 78.5 cm squared let's finish this with the square and triangle classes I'll copy what we have for the described method Within the circle class but we'll make a different calculation describe the square it is a square with an area of take self. width times self. width the height and the width are going to be the same if it's a square then describe our triangle it is a triangle with an area of width time height we have a height in this case divided two we've already described our Circle let's describe our Square it is a square with an area of 36 CM squar it is blue and not filled let's describe our triangle it is a triangle with an area of 28.0 CM squar it is yellow and filled all right everybody that is the super function it's used in a child class to call the methods from a parent class also known as the super class it allows you to extend the functionality of the inherited methods within a child class you could use it within a Constructor to assign any attributes that all of its siblings have in common such as color or if that shape is filled when used within any other method you can extend the functionality of that method not only are we printing this message from the parent we're tacking on another PR statement before that and well everybody that is the super function in Python
1XE-_s4ZBT8,Learn Python Object Oriented Programming! 🚗,2024-05-20T18:06:45Z,hey everybody so we have finally made it to Python objectoriented Programming this is a very important topic in Python an object is a bundle of related attributes and methods attributes are similar to variables to describe what the object has so look around you right now you are surrounded by different Real World objects next to me I have a phone a cup and a book each of these objects can have different attributes to represent it for example an attribute of the phone next to me could be version number I could set that to be 13 is on could be another attribute is the phone powered on or not that could be true or false or even a price I have a cup next to me what liquid is within the cup in this case coffee what's the temperature of the cup is the cup empty is empty or even a book What's the title of the book that could be a string how many pages does the book have Pages could be another attribute now objects also have the capability to do things they have methods which are functions that belong to an object people mix up functions and methods all the time they're technically different even when teaching I tend to make that mistake calling a method a function and a function a method usually people know what you're referring to though a method is a function that belongs within an object what are some actions these objects can perform with a phone you can make a call or receive a call turn the phone on or turn the phone off those could all be functions with a cup you could fill the cup drink from the cup or empty the cup with a book you can open the book read the book and close the book an object is a bundle of related attributes and methods they can represent real world items to create many objects we'll need to utilize a Class A Class is a type of blueprint used to design the structure and layout of an object we need to design what our objects have their attributes and what they can do their methods we will create a class of car we will create some car objects class car to construct a car object we need a special type of method called a Constructor it works similarly to a function we will Define a function of double underscore init meaning initialize double underscore again and then follow this with a set of parentheses this is our Constructor method we need this method in order to construct objects it's a Dunder method Dunder meaning double underscore that's a future topic I don't want you to be overloaded with information right now all you need to know is that we need this method in order to create objects this method behaves similar to a function we need to set up the parameters self is already provided to us self means this object we're creating right now this car so what are some attributes that a car should have a model that could be a string like a BMW a year that could be a number a color let's add a Boolean of for sale is the car for sale or not that's true or false to assign these attributes we're going to access self self dot the name of the attribute self. model equals the model we receive these are parameters when we receive the name of a model we will assign it to this object let's do this with year self. year equals year self. color equals color self do for sale equals for sale this is an example of a few attributes that a car might have a model year color and if it's for sale or not represented by a Boolean now to construct a car object we need a unique name for this car let's just say car one car 1 equals take the name of the class add a set of parentheses to invoke The Constructor we're going to do this this almost exactly like a function we have parameter set up we need to send a matching number of arguments self is provided to us behind the scenes automatically we need a model year color and if it's for sale or not so pick a car of you're choosing I'll pick my favorite car the model will be a Mustang for the year I'll go with the recent year of 2024 a color I'll pick red is the car for sale I like this car so no I will set that to be false make sure false is capitalized let's see what happens if I attempt to print our car object of car one what we're given is the memory address of this car object where it's located but I would like one of the attributes located at this memory address instead of printing the object itself we're going to access one of the attributes found within this car we will follow the name of the car with a DOT this dot it's known as the attribute access operator I would like the model of car one that would give me Mustang let's access the year take the name of the car car 1 dot the year 2024 followed by the color car 1. color red car one is it for sale we'll print that that is false now let's create a second car we're going to reuse this class to create a second car we will create Car 2 equals car we'll pass in some different arguments a Corvette the year will be 2025 the color will be blue is this car for sale let's say that is true instead of accessing car 1's attributes let's access car 2's attributes that would give us a Corvette the year is 2025 the color is blue for sale is set to true or even a third car car 3 equals a new car we will pass in a string of charger the year 2026 the color will be yellow is this car for sale let's say that is true as well then I will print car 3's attributes the model is charger the year is 2026 the color is yellow for sale is set to True with classes they can take up a lot of space for better organization you can place them within a new python file so let's cut our class and we will create a new python file within our project folder file new python file the name of this python file is going to be all lowercase car then we will paste the class that we cut originally class car which has a capital c so from our main python file we're going to import our car file our car module mod from the name of the module car import the name of the class car then when I run this program nothing should change we should still have access to all of our car objects you could either keep your classes within your main python file or import them if you would like to organize things let's talk about methods methods are actions that our objects can perform within our class we will Define a method of Drive self is going to be provided to us when we invoke the drive function let's print you drive the car what other things can cars do let's stop we will print you stop the car let's take car one access the drive method you drive the car car 2 also has a drive method you drive the car same thing with car 3 you drive the car let's access the stop method car one. stop car 2. stop and car 3. stop these methods are identical for each car object instead of printing the word car let's insert the model of the car I will convert these print statements to F strings instead of the word car let's add a placeholder let's add self. model self is referring to the object we're currently working with use the attribute AIS operator followed by the name of the attribute let's also do this with the stop method sell do model let's take car one use the drive method you drive the Mustang car one. stop you drive the Mustang you stop the Mustang let's do this with Car 2 you drive the Corvette you stop the Corvette car three you drive the charger you stop the charger now within our F strings let's also insert let's insert the color I'll add a placeholder self. color do this with stop as well self. color you drive the yellow charger you stop the yellow charger car one you drive the red Mustang you stop the red Mustang card two you Drive the blue Corvette you stop the blue Corvette let's add one last method let's create a method to describe our car we'll print the details of the car let's print I'll use an F string add three placeholders let's print self doye followed by self. color then self. model we'll take car 1 use the describe method that we created describe car 1 car 1 is a 2024 red Mustang describe Car 2 Car 2 is a 2025 blue Corvette car 3 is a 2026 yellow charger all right everybody so those are objects in Python an object is a bundle of related attrib attributes attributes are variables that an object has and methods methods are functions that belong to an object they Define what this object can do and well everybody that is a summary of object-oriented programming using python
JLIF5XHBL3E,Random event generator in C++ 🎁,2024-05-20T01:36:24Z,hey everybody in this topic we're going to create a random event generator using random numbers and a switch this might be useful maybe if you're writing a game you need some random event to occur like random monsters show up or the weather changes anything like that we'll be working with random numbers you may need to include this header file include c time because we need access to the time function to work with random numbers we'll need to generate a seed srand function pass in time pass in zero this function will use the current time as a seed to generate random numbers we'll create a local variable to store our random number int rand num equals use the rand function modulus then what's the range of numbers you would like i would like the numbers one through five but this will give us zero through four so i'm going to add one to the end my integer randomnum will be a random number between one and five i'm going to create a switch to examine this random number against many matching cases so we have case one through five if the random number is one what would you like to do exactly so in this program i think we're going to give away prizes like it's a random prize generator depending on the random number we'll give a participant a random prize standard output you win how about a bumper sticker a bumper sticker that will be the lowest tier prize then we should probably add a break to break out of the switch okay let's think of some others i should probably break after these prize two will be a t-shirt prize three how about a free lunch prize for maybe a gift card case five concert tickets that sounds good so when i run this program we'll generate a random number between one and five depending on what that number is we'll execute the code found within one of these cases let's see what i won i want a free lunch if i try this again there's a good chance it'll be a different prize this time i want a bumper sticker i want a bumper sticker again come on i want those concert tickets i'll take a gift card that's not bad now if you don't add these break statements you'll just fall through the switch you want a gift card you want concert tickets so if you only want somebody to win one prize you'll want to exit out of the switch by including this break statement so yeah everybody i thought that might be an interesting program you can generate some random event maybe it's for a game or something i thought maybe a random prize giveaway would kind of be interesting this program is more or less for practice your assignment is to write a switch with some random events then post it in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a random event generator using c plus plus
BO6XOcfTyhU,PHPMyAdmin create a table easy,2024-05-20T01:25:10Z,all right everybody so in today's video I'm going to explain how we can create a table using phpmyadmin there's two ways to get here you can either go to your zamp control panel then press this admin button next to mySQL or you can head to this URL to create a table let's go to our databases we should have a database already created in the last video we created a database named businessdb so let's click on it let's begin by creating a table name I'll create a table of users these will be registered users then set the number of columns I'll stick with four then we will hit the create button in this column we will set the name of each column our first column will be for user IDs let's name this column ID we will set the data type to be int we won't specify a length if you would like a default value you can set that here we're going to use the ID field to be set to Auto increment you can set the characters but we will keep that as the default like for some reason if you need I don't know Greek you can use Greek but let's just use the default to add an index you can do that here we will set our ID to be our primary index then I will click the Go Button to enable auto increment on a column you can check the AI button it's for auto increment that should be it for this column let's create a column for usernames the column name will be user for the data type let's say varchar then set a Max size I think 25 is good for our users let's have each user be unique then press go then let's move on to the next column this will be for passwords for the data type let's set that to be char which is right here I recommend hashing passwords in our database we won't be storing plain text passwords in case you know we get hacked or in case somebody uses SQL injection we'll be storing a hash of a password I'll set the size to be 255. encrypting and hashing algorithms are always changing and updating let's future proof our password field just by setting it to something large then let's add a registration date maybe we'll name the column register underscore date let's select not just date but date time I want to know the time that they register for the default let's use a current timestamp that should be good for our table if you would like some SQL code you can preview the SQL this is what we would be writing but we're going to be doing this automatically with phpmyadmin so let's save and we now have our table if I were to go to browse this is our table but there's currently no rows we'll be adding some rows with PHP but for testing purposes let's insert one manually using phpmyadmin so we will insert some test values with our ID it's set to Auto increment we don't necessarily need to put in a value for the user let's say the user is SpongeBob and for the password his password will be pineapple one you can also encrypt this password using password hash we'll cover hashing passwords in the next video with our registration date this is set to a current timestamp so that's going to be done automatically let's press go this would be the SQL query but yeah one row has been inserted let's go back to our table the username is SpongeBob password is pineapple1 and here is the registration date well date and time then to delete a row you can click this delete button then press ok and that is how to create a table in phpmyadmin and in the next topic we will be inserting some rows into our table using PHP
EgDQ7Z13FQc,PHP $_COOKIE explained,2024-05-20T01:22:18Z,hey everybody Welcome to the wonderful world of cookies a cookie if you don't know basically speaking it's information about a user stored in a user's web browser that's why you might receive targeted advertisements platforms such as YouTube they might remember your browsing preferences and you can store other non-sensitive data now to create a cookie in PHP we will use the set cookie function it's actually pretty simple our cookies are stored as an associative array first is the key our key will be favorite food the second element is the value my favorite food will be Pizza the third argument is an expiration time cookies typically expire after a certain amount of time to set the time we can use the time function then add this is in seconds for one day that would be 86 400 seconds if you need your cookie to expire after two days we can just multiply this by two then let me enclose these within parentheses just for clarity then the next argument is the file path I'll use a forward slash for the default file path and there we are so I'm going to save this now if we open up our web browser I'm going to right click go to inspect you can find your cookies underneath application then go to cookies underneath storage oh look at that we have a cookie the key is favorite food the value is pizza and there is an expiration date here too there it is let's add a few more cookies set cookie favorite drink I will set the value to be coffee this cookie will expire after three days there's our next cookie one more favorite dessert I will pick ice cream this cookie will expire after four days so 86 400 times 4. there we have three cookies favorite dessert favorite drink favorite food now to delete a cookie all you have to do is set the time to minus zero so let's do that for all of these yeah look at that the cookies are gone now let's revert that back and we have cookies again let's print each key value pair from all of our cookies I will use a for each Loop we are accessing the cookie super Global variable our cookies are stored as key value pairs using a for each Loop we can write as key Arrow value I will Echo each key value pair key equals value then a break here are the three cookies we set favorite food equals Pizza favorite drink equals coffee favorite dessert equals ice cream to access one of the values you would need the key maybe I will display an advertisement based on somebody's favorite food maybe we remember what their favorite food is I will use the is set function is set place it within an if statement we will check within our cookies add the key of favorite food if their favorite food key has a value let's display it buy some then let's access our cookie variable at the Key of favorite food okay else Echo I don't know your favorite food our cookie for our favorite food is currently set let me get rid of this for each Loop if our favorite food key has a value that's set will display an advertisement for their favorite food buy some pizza if this cookie wasn't set I'll let it expire by setting the time to minus zero I don't know your favorite food this cookie isn't set we will execute the else Clause alright everybody so those are cookies they are just information about a user stored in a user's web browser these are used for targeted advertisements browsing preferences and other non-sensitive data and well everybody that's an introduction to cookies in PHP
HAs7YXPduZI,PHP for loops explained,2024-05-20T01:16:27Z,hey everybody in today's video I need to explain for Loops a for Loop will repeat some code a certain amount of times for example I will display the word hello hello then I will add a line break I can write code once then repeat it however many times that I want with the for Loop to create a for Loop type four parentheses curly braces then place your code you want to be repeated within the set of curly braces I would like to display the word hello a certain amount of times that's the nice thing about for Loops you can write code once then repeat it but we'll need to calculate how many times we're going to repeat it within the parentheses of the for Loop we can write up to three optional statements each separated with a semicolon the first statement is that we can create a counter it's as if we're assigning a variable a common naming convention for a counter is variable I I meaning index X I can set this equal to zero to begin with the next statement is a stopping condition when this condition is no longer true we escape the for loop I would like to display the word hello five times my condition will be variable I is less than 5 once I is no longer less than five we will escape the third optional statement we can use to increment or decrement our counter after each iteration I will increment I by One i++ this code will be repeated five times here we are 1 2 3 4 5 instead of displaying the word hello let's display our index I then add a line break I currently holds our counter we set the counter to begin at zero and it will stop when I reaches 5 0 1 2 3 4 maybe we would like to start at 1 and continue as long as I is less than or equal to 5 then we're no longer beginning at zero we could change this condition to be 10 we will count up to 10 or 100 we will count up to 100 when you increment your variable you can increment by a different number like two I + = 2 we are now counting up by twos 1 3 5 7 if we change our counter to be two we'll start at two then count up by two or maybe we can count up by threes 2 5 8 11 now to decrement let's begin at 10 our counter will be at 10 we'll continue this for loop as long as I is greater than zero then to decrement take I then add minus minus so now we begin at 10 and decrement by one during each iteration or we can even decrement by twos i - = 2 so we begin at 10 and we're decrementing by twos so that's a for Loop you repeat some code a certain amount of times there are three optional statements within the for Loop a counter we can declare a condition then we can increment our counter by a certain amount or decrement let's go over an exercise we will create an HTML form in vs code hit exclamation point tab that will generate some HTML code we'll create a form the opening form tag will have an action attribute of our PHP page index.php the method let's assign to post we'll create a label label close it enter a number to count two we will add a text box input type the type is text the name will be counter then a submit button input type equals submit for the value let's say start the user is going to type in a number to count up to we'll need to get that value from the text box let's say variable counter we will access the post super Global variable we would like our counter then we'll create a for Loop for parentheses curly braces we'll need our index for our for Loop so variable I equals zero to begin with we're counting up our condition will be variable I is less than or equal to our counter then we will increment variable I by One during each iteration during each iteration let's Echo whatever variable I is then add a line break let's see what happens let's refresh this let's count up to 10 I'll enter 10 Press Start then we count up to 10 if you would like to exclude zero we can set I to be one there we are we have counted up to 10 or I could pick a different number like 100 Press Start we now count up to 100 now what we're going to do is count down from a number enter a number to countown from we're going to change our for Loop a little bit we will set our counter of I to equal the number that we receive our counter variable will continue as long as I is greater than zero then we will decrement I so let's save you might have to refresh let's count down from 10 Press Start and here we are we have started at 10 and we have counted down to one or I can enter a different number like 100 so we start at 100 then count down to one so that's a for Loop everybody you can repeat some code a certain amount of times you only have to write it once then repeat it however many times that you need and well everybody those are four Loops in PHP
CuOZ8d7gWeU,PHP arrays explained,2024-05-20T01:17:19Z,why hello again everybody today I need to explain a raise in PHP think of an array as a special type of variable which can hold more than one value at a time in my example I have four different variables food one food two food three food four we have an apple orange banana coconut it can be very inconvenient to have to work with so many variables it would be really nice if I could store all of these values in one place which is what we can do with an array let's delete these variables we will create a special type of variable which is an array to create an array you'll need a variable name to begin with let's say Foods Foods equals to create an array type array add a set of parentheses then the semicolon at the end this is a function which we'll discuss more in the future whatever values you're going to squeeze into this variable just place them within the parentheses we had four variables Apple orange banana coconut separate all of your values with the comma there we go we now have what appears to be a variable but it's technically an array it stores more than one value in one convenient place if I was to Echo my array which I named Foods this is what happens warning a rate to string conversion we can't directly print this array instead you would need to access one of the elements an element is a given position within an array currently we have four elements because there's four values to access one of the elements found within your array after the array name add a set of square brackets then an element number with the raise the first element has an index of zero I would like the first element within my array so the element is going to be zero that will display Apple which is the first element in my array let's do this with the others for practice let's Echo Foods at index one I should probably add a line break so let me do some string concatenation real quick I'll add a line break do that here as well we have apple Orange let's do this with the others Foods at index 2 is banana Foods at index three that would be coconut what if I attempt to access an element that doesn't exist we only have four elements if I access our array Foods at index 4 well then we have a warning undefined array key for that is something you do need to pay attention to if you need to display all of the elements of an array there's an easier way of doing this instead of echoing every single element line by line we can use a for each Loop for each add a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces for each take your array Foods as now what we need is a temporary name for each element within the array my personal naming convention if I'm accessing a single element within an array I like to take the array name and set the variable name to be the singular version if we're working with Foods well each element is considered a food for every food in foods if we were working with different values let's say cars my for each Loop may be for every car in Cars but that's just my naming convention So within this for each loop I will Echo each food then I'll add a break line okay let's see what happens here are all the elements in our array to display all of the elements in your array a convenient way to do so is to use a for each Loop there are a lot of useful utilities related to arrays to change one of the elements of an array type the name of the array then we'll list an index number I would like to change the first element in this array to be a pineapple type the name of the array followed by a set of square brackets the first element in my array is zero I will set that to equal a new value Foods at index 0 is now a pineapple pineapple orange banana coconut there is a push function which will add a new element to the end of your array array underscore push function within the set of parentheses type in the name of your array comma then a value at the end of my array I would like to add a pineapple Apple orange banana coconut pineapple you can add more than one value too let's add a kiwi as well Apple orange banana coconut pineapple kiwi that is the array push function you can add one or more elements to the end of your array after you create one then we have the pop function array underscore pop pop will remove the last element in your array place your array name within the set of parentheses array pop Foods now we have apple orange banana our last element coconut was removed then we have shift array underscore shift shift will remove the first element in your array then shift all of the elements over by one within the set of parentheses list your array name we now have an orange banana coconut our Apple was removed it was shifted shifted out of the array we can reverse an array array underscore reverse place your array name within the set of parentheses now this isn't going to work I'll explain why our array is still in the same order Apple orange banana coconut this function returns a new array we can assign the result to a new array such as reversed Foods equals the array reverse function then I could display this our array is now reversed coconut banana orange Apple otherwise the array that's returned we can reassign it to the same array which is what I'll do that does the same thing if you would rather reuse the same array that is how to reverse an array we can count the elements in an array I will Echo use the count function place your array name within the function let me cut this real quick we have four elements within our array use the count function to get the current number of elements within your array all right everybody so that's an array think of it as a special type of variable that can hold more than one value at a time it's a convenient way to store multiple values that are similar or related in place of creating many different variables it's a lot easier to work with an array than several variables and well everybody those are arrays in PHP
SI69DXbYHXU,PHP tutorial for beginners 🐘,2024-05-20T01:11:37Z,hey everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in today's video I'm going to teach you guys everything you need to know to get started working with PHP so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you would like to be notified if I release new courses in the future be sure to subscribe because I kind of release them randomly that is all PHP is a server-side scripting language it's used to build Dynamic web pages it runs on a server not the user's web browser although haters say PHP is dead it's still used on 70 percent of all known websites I don't know that doesn't sound dead to me many developers prefer PHP for its speed Simplicity and flexibility it's a popular choice for small businesses and Freelancers especially since in the news lately you hear about layoffs in the tech industry PHP was released in 1995 it was originally an acronym for personal home page but that was later changed to PHP hypertext preprocessor to reflect the language's evolution in fact PHP was never intended to be a new programming language it grew organically and out of control until it became the Behemoth that it is today fun fact the mascot of PHP is an elephant which is named elephant Ella PHP find I don't know how I would describe the basics of PHP is as follows a browser sends a request to a server PHP on that server processes that request then the server sends HTML back to the browser our server running PHP can even communicate to a database then back to the web browser PHP is most commonly used with relational databases such as MySQL postgres and Oracle PHP can be written alongside with HTML before beginning the series you'll want to have a solid foundation on HTML you will need to know MySQL but that won't be until about video 20. for your web server I recommend zamp zamp is a cross-platform web server solution stack it's basically a software suite it contains an Apache server MySQL and PHP you'll also need some sort of text editor where are you going going to write the code vs code tends to be the most popular nowadays and that's what I use for my own personal projects we'll write our code with vs code then run our code on our xampp server since we can't run it on a web browser I'll show you how we can download both the xampp server and the vs code text editor now we will begin the installation process of a server that we can execute PHP code within go to this URL apachefriends.org like I said before PHP code is executed on a server and returned to a web browser click on one of the relevant download links for your operating system I'm running Windows I will download the windows version okay for me the installation process has started and it's done so let's open it for setup we're going to click next all we really need is MySQL and phpmyadmin it looks like PHP is already selected for us then next remember this file location my folder containing all of my zamp files is located in my C drive next you can select a language I'll pick English next and give it a minute do you want to start the control panel now we might as well and finish here's the control panel for my zamp server we will start the Apache service if everything works the Apache module is highlighted green that means it's working if you ever need to stop this module you can hit the stop button let's start MySQL as well and our MySQL server is working if you see any red text within this log that means there is an error if you run into any problems just check to see what that error was but everything for me is running fine this control panel will run behind the scenes I can close out of it but it's still running which is important hey this is bro from the future I forgot to mention in this video that if you ever shut down your computer you will have to open up the control panel again and restart these Services yeah I forgot to mention that so be sure to do that now that our xampp server is downloaded we will need that vs code text editor I'm assuming that some of you have that downloaded already but if you don't here's how if you need a text editor I recommend Visual Studio code if you're interested in downloading this text editor head to this URL code.visualstudio.com I'm going to click this blue download button select the correct download link for my operating system I'm running Windows I will select this one then we will run this executable accept the license agreement yes I did read it that fast you do have the option of selecting a destination location I'll keep it as the default next next I'll create a desktop icon then next and install we might as well launch vs code then finish I have vs code open along with the modern web browser I'm using Google Chrome in the series we're going to create a new file within our zamp folder so let's open a folder remember that file path for the zamp server that's where you're going to look for me that was in my C drive go to xampp under htdocs we're going to create a new folder new folder I'll name this folder website to contain my website stuff then I will select folder within my website folder I'm going to create a new file I will name this file index.php the reason that I'm naming this file index is because that is the default for a home page so we now have a PHP file in vs code If you're receiving a warning that states cannot validate since a PHP installation could not be found we need to validate the executable path of the PHP executable found within our xampp server to do that we're going to find our settings file it's a Json file PHP validate executable path edit in the settings Json file let me maximize this next to PHP validate executable path we need to find the file path to the PHP executable again within my C drive within my zamp folder go to PHP then copy this file path for the executable I'll right click go to properties copy this location close out of this window paste that executable path then add PHP dot EXE then these may have to be forward slashes let's save on Windows you can press Ctrl s to save close out of these settings and that warning goes away I also recommend a few extensions the first extension is PHP intellifence it should be this one it gives you access to a few tools that are useful for PHP development let's install that plugin then look up the live server extension it offers a live reload feature then lastly PHP server it allows you to serve your project with PHP those are the three extensions that I recommend alright we are now ready to get started in a web browser to access your xampp server you can type localhost as the URL this will bring you to the zamp dashboard we would like to access the website folder of the zamp server so let's add localhost slash the name of that folder website our PHP code will execute on the server and be returned to this web browser whatever the output is to write some PHP code Type left angle bracket question mark PHP wherever our PHP code ends type question mark right angle bracket our PHP code will be between these two angle brackets to display a message you can type Echo either single quotes or double quotes then a semicolon at the end a semicolon is kind of like the period at the end of a sentence in English I will type a message I like pizza to save you can go to the top file save or use the shortcut which I'll be using so for me that's Ctrl s if I were to reload this webpage it displays my message I like pizza to make your life a lot easier we can add a live server extension to your web browser currently I'm using Chrome to add a live server extension I'm going to go to settings extensions open Chrome web store then search live server and that should be this one add to Chrome ADD extension let's close out of these tabs I'm going to go to extensions select live server web extension enable live reload we'll need the actual server address as well as your live server address this URL is the actual server address if you're on a Mac it may contain a port number such as 8080. so let's copy this address go to extensions then add the actual server address now we need the live server address to find this we can go to vs code press this go live button there should be a new tab that pops up copy this address that is the live server address then we will paste it within the live server address of this live server web extension then press apply you may need to restart your web browser as well all right that was localhost Slash website you know what I don't just like pizza I love pizza if I were to save this file it should update automatically see within our website it now says I love pizza let's add a second line with Echo Echo double quotes add a semicolon to the end let's add another line it's really good the output is all on one line to add a line break within your set of quotes you can add a Break Tag I love pizza it's really good to add a comment a comment is used as a note for yourself or other Developers all you have to type is double forward slashes then some message this is a comment our comment is not displayed as output it's mostly just used for notes for a multi-line comment you would type forward slash asterisk that will begin a multi-line comment this is a multi-line [Music] comment the end of our PHP script is currently green that means it's being included within this multi-line comment wherever you need your multi-line comment to end you would type asterisk then forward slash the end of the script is blue again and you can see that this multi-line comment isn't being displayed as output now the cool thing about PHP files is that they can contain HTML CSS JavaScript and well of course PHP so I will also include some HTML code within this PHP file so in vs code to generate some boilerplate code you can type exclamation point and then tab we now have some HTML markup within our PHP file within the body of our document I'll add maybe a button I'll create a button to order a pizza I should probably precede this button with a line break so there's our button it currently doesn't do anything but that's just a demonstration that you can include more than just PHP code within a PHP file alright everybody so that is an introduction to PHP in the next video we'll discuss variables hey if you're enjoying this video please let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
przRGJtl0HY,PHP variables and data types,2024-05-20T01:11:54Z,well hello everybody Welcome to lesson two today I'm going to discuss variables in PHP a variable think of it as a reusable container that holds data we give that container a name that is the variable name there's different data types we'll discuss they include but are not limited to Strings integers floats and booleans there are still more than this but these are a few of the basics for beginners let's get started to declare a variable you type a dollar sign then a unique variable name I'm going to store a user's name a unique identifier could be just name I will set this variable name equal to a string of text so place your string of text within a set of double quotes add a semicolon to the end because we always do that why don't you enter in your first name then to display this variable as output we can type our Echo statement then add the variable name so type dollar sign name semicolon let's save and there is our name rendered as HTML the data type of this variable is a string it's a string of text and it can include spaces add a space followed by your last name as output we're displaying my first name and my last name all as one long string of text if you Echo a message directly that is known as a string literal I will display a message such as hello then I want to add this variable name the easiest way to do that is to add a set of curly braces as a placeholder and within the curly braces add your variable name so dollar sign name hello whatever your name is let's add a few more variables how about a food variable what's the food you like I like pizza of course which we learned from the last video hello name I'll display another message Echo you like at our placeholder our variable name food let's save I'm going to disable this page is not in Dutch for some reason our output is all on one line I'm just going to add a line break a low bro code you like pizza what's another example of a string maybe an email let's declare our variable which we will name email add a set of quotes semicolon to the end uh fake at gmail.com so let's add another line break let's Echo your email is at our placeholder for a variable then our variable name email your email is fake gmail.com that's the string data type it's just a series of text your text can contain numbers such as fake123 gmail.com so even though these are numbers we treat them more as characters we can't use these for any sort of math that's where our next data type comes in integers whole integers an example of a whole integer would be somebody's age let's say that I'm 21 age equals 21. I'm not 21 anymore but I like to think that I still am the data contained within this variable age is an integer we don't have any quotes around this number I will Echo my age variable Echo you are are variable age years old let me add a blind break here there you are 21 years old and int is simply a whole integer you know somebody wouldn't be like half a year old like 21.5 and age would be a whole number another example of a whole integer variable could be users let's create a variable named users and there are maybe two users online you wouldn't have half a user users would be a whole number let's Echo the amount of users there are at a placeholder are variable users online there are two online after the variable users let's add the word users there are two users online one more example of a whole integer could be a quantity you wouldn't have half a product you would have a whole product let's create a variable named quantity I'll just set it to three let's Echo you would like to buy are variable quantity items then a line break you would like to buy three items okay those are whole integers let's discuss floats next a float is a floating Point number it's a number that contains a decimal portion these variables are ins integers they're whole numbers an example of a float could be a grade point average maybe my grade point average is 2.5 so let's Echo your GPA is then our GPA variable then line break your GPA is 2.5 I think we're getting the hang of this I'm going to speed things up another float could be a price with the merry concurrency a price contains dollars and cents with the cents being a decimal portion suppose a pizza is 4.99 let's Echo your Pizza is I'll add my price variable your pizza is price line break your pizza is 4.99 I'm going to add the dollar sign before 4.99 but we have a problem PHP is getting confused because we precede our variable names with the dollar sign undefined variable 4.99 if you would like to display a dollar sign as output you need an escape sequence I will precede my dollar sign with a backslash then it works just fine let me add your your pizza is 4.99 so that's another example of a floating Point number a float another could be a tax rate tax rate I'll make up a tax rate like a sales tax rate 5.1 sounds good let's Echo the sales tax rate is tax rate oop I'm forgetting a dollar sign tax rate percent then a line break the sales tax rate is 5.1 percent those are floats floating Point numbers they're numbers that contain a decimal portion integers are whole numbers the last data type we'll cover are booleans booleans are either true or they're false it's like a light switch it can only be on or off so what are some variables that could be considered booleans what if somebody is employed they either are employed or they're not employed equals true another could be online is somebody online or offline maybe a user's offline I will set that to be false what about for sale something is for sale or it's not for sale I'll set that to be true now with booleans when you display them as output you don't see true or false rather this is what you see let's Echo online status colon then I'll add my Boolean variable online so online is false online status and then nothing appears the Boolean values when you output them if it's false it doesn't display anything however if online was true that will output a one one means true zero means false however we won't display zero nothing is displayed for false usually with Boolean variables we don't normally display them as output we use them internally within a program we might use these within an if statement or a loop which we'll discuss in the future but at this point you should be aware of the existence of Boolean variables in summary a Boolean variable is either true or false I'm going to get rid of these Echo statements you can mix and match variables when you display output with Echo I will add two variables this time here's a hypothetical situation you own a pizza restaurant and somebody places an online order for a given amount of pizzas you have ordered let's add our variable quantity X then our variable food you have ordered three x Pizza let's add an S to the end to make it plural you have ordered three x pizzas then let's calculate a total what I'm going to do now is declare a variable but I'm not going to assign it a value quite yet we will calculate a total total equals null null means no value We'll add a value later after displaying our message you have ordered quantity X food let's reassign our total variable equal to are quantity times to use multiplication you use an asterisk our variable price so now our total should contain a number let's output it Echo your total is let's add our variable total and see what we have ooh I need a line break I'm forgetting about that you have ordered three x pizzas your total is 14.97 So I need to add a dollar sign or you can pick some other unit of currency however PHP is currently confused because we're preceding our placeholder with a dollar sign so I need to use an escape sequence your total is 14.97 now in my program if I were to change the quantity well this total is going to be updated four pizzas is 19.96 if I were to change the price that would also be reflected now the total is 23.96 all right everybody so those are variables they are just a named container for storing reusable data there are a few different data types strings which are a series of text ins which are whole integers floats which are floating Point numbers and booleans which are either true or false in the next topic we'll have more practice with arithmetic and PHP and well those are variables in PHP
CgkZ7MvWUAA,React Full Course for free ⚛️,2024-01-16T15:55:09Z,"hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in today's video I'm going to show you everything you need to know to get started working with reactjs so why don't you go ahead and sit back relax and enjoy the show react is a JavaScript library not framework that's used to easily build and arrange user interfaces for web applications react focuses on building a web application using these things called components a component is a self-contained section of code that functions as as a reusable building block think of Legos you could say a Lego is similar to react component each Lego represents a section of reusable JavaScript and HTML code we can build a diarama or other complicated structure from these Legos if we use enough of them and in the correct places react uses a syntax extension of JavaScript known as jsx meaning JavaScript XML jsx allows you to write HTML like code within your JavaScript files react also utilizes a virtual Dom it's a lightweight version of the real Dom of a web page we can keep track of any changes made to the virtual Dom and only apply that specific change to the real Dom without needing to refresh the entire web page only that specific section this reduces rendering performance overhead before we do begin you will need to know JavaScript since react is a JavaScript library everything up to arrays classes objects and es6 feature such as Arrow functions will be necessary HTML will also be mandatory since our react components involve rendering HTML elements and applying CSS I do have full free courses on my YouTube channel on these topics if you need to catch up or you need a refresher so that's a quick overview of react we'll move on to the installation instructions next we're going to download nodejs from this URL nodejs.org node.js is a backend JavaScript runtime environment it executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser we're mostly interested in the node package manager that comes with it let's download the latest version of node.js open it when the download is complete select next read the license agreement yes I did read it that fast next select a destination folder I'll keep it as is you can define a custom setup but that's outside of the scope of this tutorial series we'll press next we'll skip tools for Native modules press next and install then finish you'll also need a text editor I recommend vs code since you've made it this far in my web development series I'm assuming you already have one downloaded which you can get from this site code dovisual studio.com and select the correct download for your operating system within VSS code I'm going to create a project folder let's go to explore open folder just for convenience I'll place my project folder on my desktop I'll create a new folder I'll name mine website then we will select this folder we're going to need to open up command prompt if you're using Windows or terminal if you're on Mac you can also do this within vs code go to the hamburger menu up top terminal new terminal we within our website folder we will type the command npm meaning node package manager create vit at latest meaning latest version V's a development server it's a modern replacement to create react app which is now outdated hit enter we'll need a name for this project a common naming convention for a user's first react project is my react app that's a common name that you'll see enter select a framework using the arrow keys we can select whatever framework we would like to use we will select react hit enter are we going to use typescript or JavaScript we'll stick with plain JavaScript all right here are the last few commands and they are given to us we'll change the directory to our react app CD meaning change directory my react app and that's the name of the folder where our project is located npm install that is the second command the last command is npm runev to start the development server npm runev all right so our web server is found at this address let's copy it then open up a web browser let's paste that address and here we are within our development server this is a sample project that's given to us it even includes this little counter hey this is future bro I was editing this video and I totally forgot to mention how you can restart the server if you close out of it all you got to do is open up a terminal let's go to terminal new terminal we have to be sure that we're within our application folder I'm going to change my directory by typing CD the name of the folder my react app then npm run Dev to start the development server and let's refresh that yep it seems like it's working so yes I forgot to mention that that is all I'm quickly going to cover the project structure of our react application we'll begin with the node modules folder this folder contains external libraries and packages that our project relies on a few of which are build tools utility libraries routing libraries just to name a few we won't be spending any time directly in this folder but you should still be aware what it's for if it just contains external libraries and packages that our project relies on next we have the public folder the public folder contains any public assets one of which in here is a vit image it should be this image right here this folder can contain public fonts images videos they're not bundled during the final output they're typically available via a URL just to demonstrate I'm going to delete this image file and see what happens yep and that logo is gone so my vit logo was a public asset via a URL and let's put that back then we have the source folder we'll spend 99% of our time within the source folder we have an assets folder that can contain images and videos the assets folder is very similar to the public folder but files within the assets folder are bundled during the final output public assets are not and they're generally available via a URL my re act image is within the assets folder currently we have a main jsx file remember that jsx is Javascript XML in a way this functions as our main Javascript file react works with components we're adding a single component an app component which we are importing so let's take a look at our app component the app component in this example you could say is the root component we have two different stylesheets a stylesheet for app and we have an index CSS stylesheet this is the main CSS file for our application we're importing this file from our main jsx file right here so that's the source folder then we have an index HTML file this is the main entry point into our program within the body of our document we have a development with an ID of root as well as a script to our main jsx file a few other things you should know about is this package Json file Json file files are structured in key value pairs this file contains metadata about our project such as the project name the version number what build we're using we're using vit and the react version number just to name a few all right everybody so in just a moment we will be creating our first react component we already do have one component that is app right now this is serving as a sample project for us then we are importing app to main jsx this is our main J s x file think of it as the main JavaScript file we are creating a root element and including our app component within our app component we do have a function delete everything within this function that should eliminate our sample project and we no longer need these Imports we can delete them too but you do want to keep this export statement components can have dedicated stylesheets which you can see here for app CSS we are going to delete this because we no longer need it we do have an app component that's going to serve as the root we will add other components to our app component our app component ties them all together to create a new component go to your Source folder we're going to rightclick then go to new file we will create a component for a header the extension is jsx because it's a JavaScript XML file we will be working with function based components we will create a function with the name of header do pay attention to the capitalization then we would like to export this component so we can import it elsewhere at the end of this file type export default the name of the component header within our header function we can write a combination of JavaScript and HTML all we're going to do within this function is return something return parentheses semicolon within the return statement you can write pure HTML I will create a header element so react components they're only capable of returning a single element but you can place children elements within within our header element I will create an H1 element with text of my website just to be sure everything is working let's save I'm holding contrl s on Windows we will go to our app component then import the header component So within app we will type the statement import the name of the component header from a location that location is going to be do SL header. jsx we can now use this header component within our app component we will also be returning something so we will need a return statement return parentheses semicolon what are we going to return I would like to use my header component so to add a component we need a set of angle brackets then type the name of the component header like this they're a pair of two and the second one is closed that's why we have a forward slash preceding it we now have a header component you can shorten the syntax as well take your component end it with the forward slash that also works too it's a shorthand way of writing the same thing let's head back to our header component We'll add a few more elements after our H1 element let's create a navigation element then within the navigation element we'll create an unordered list within the unordered list we'll create a few list items the first will be home these are list items you would typically see for a navigation bar home about services and contact we now have our unordered list I'll enclose our list items within anchor tags to make them hyperlinks a hre equals I don't want these to go anywhere I'm just going to leave these empty I'll add a pound sign and then be sure to close these anchor tags we'll place our text within the anchor tag so they are now hyperlinks okay let's do that for the other list items there we are then after my navigation element I will add a horizontal rule to make it look nice okay there is our header component we no longer need to work with this header component we do have some styling already applied those Styles can be found within index.css if you would like to start fresh and eliminate all of these Styles you can delete everything from here then you do have HTML with no CSS in a future video I'll show you various ways in which we can apply CSS to a react component but for now we'll just keep this the same our head element is now complete we will create a new element for a footer again go to our source folder right click go to new file footer. jsx we are creating a function based component it's a function that's going to return a footer component then at the end of our script we will export default the name of the component footer so that we we can import it elsewhere our footer is going to return something so we need a return statement then within the set of parentheses we can return a single element we will return a footer element but remember you can place children elements within an element it still only counts as one then so what do we want to do for our footer I'll include a paragraph element within the paragraph element I'm going to add a copyright symbol to add a copyright Mark Type ampersand copy semi call in then afterwards I'll add your website name all right now we need to import this footer going back to our app component we will import footer from footer. jsx then I would like to include a footer component after the header now pay attention to this we're returning two components we have this warning we only have the capability of returning a single component that's how our return statements are designed jsx elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag do you want a jsx fragment so since we only have the capability of returning a single enclosing tag we're we're going to enclose our components with what's known as a fragment it's just an empty set of ankle brackets so we will enclose all components within a fragment and that should work we have our footer component following our header component we have our header and our footer let's make a few more changes to our footer I'm going to zoom out a little bit within our return statement we can insert some Javas script to insert some JavaScript you need a set of curly braces I will create a new date object this is some JavaScript code new date parentheses I would just like the year I will follow this object with get full year method let's save and take a look so I'm filming this video near the end of 2023 your web application should return the current year when ever you're watching this all right our footer component is now done I'm going to create a component for a unordered list to sandwich between our header and our footer I'll create a component for food we will go to our source folder create a new file this component will be food. jsx again we are creating a function based component with the name of food then we will export this component when we're done export default food be sure to add a return statement before we add anything to the return statement I will create some JavaScript variables so normally if you're adding JavaScript code within the return statement you need a set of curly braces but outside of the return statement you don't I will create two JavaScript constants const food one pick some food for me I will pick an orange let's make that Capital all right then let's create a second food variable food 2 for me will be a banana within the return statement we can utilize these constants what do we want to return exactly I will return an unordered list we'll have a few list items three to be exact my first list item I'll just add some text I'll add an apple just to be sure that everything is working let's import this food component from our app component again we need an import statement import food from food. jsx we can now use the food component we will add that after the header we will add food then here is our first list item an apple okay let's head back to our food component for our second list item I will add food one that's our constant now pay attention to this if I type food one well we're literally printing the text food one since we're within our return statement I would like to include some JavaScript code we're including a JavaScript variable so I need to enclose this variable within a set of curly braces because we're within the return statement and now now my second list item is an orange then let's include food 2 but I'm going to add one more thing food 2 however I'm going to use the builtin 2 uppercase method just to demonstrate that we can use JavaScript functions all right and there is our unordered list we have an apple orange and a banana so these components are now complete and the cool thing about react as well is that we can keep on reusing these components if we would like I would like a couple food components so I will just paste another component we now have two food components or even three or four you can rearrange these components however you would like by rearranging them we can change the feel and style of our web application for demonstration purposes I will put our footer on the top that doesn't make any sense but I just want to demonstrate so our footer is now on the top followed by the header then the food component or maybe I would like the food component on top we now have our food component footer component then our header component all right everybody that is an introduction to react react is all about reusing components a component is a small section of code that can include JavaScript and HTML your function will return that code and make it reusable and that is your introduction to react hey what's going on everybody and today's video I'm going to get a little more in depth with creating components and by the end of this topic we will be creating our own card component so sit back relax and enjoy the show in today's topic I'm going to get a little more in depth with react components as we've discussed in the previous topic a component is a section of reusable jsx code it's HTML like code that can contain JavaScript I thought today we could create some card components card components are fairly popular with react app applications typically they involve a picture a title and a description you can use cards for all sorts of things in the previous topic we did delete all of the contents within our app function let's go ahead and do that now if we haven't already and we'll delete these Imports we will not need them for this lesson in the previous topic we did have a stylesheet for our app component we can delete this too we are now ready to begin within our source folder we will create a new file the name of the component will be card this is a jsx file jsx meaning JavaScript XML our components will be function based function type the name of the component card parenthesis then curly braces we will be exporting this component so that we can import it elsewhere so type export default the name of the component card within our card function we will be returning some HTML like code we'll begin with the div element we will be applying some CSS Styles we will need to set the class however with jsx class is a reserved keyword to set an elements class we have to instead use class name do pay attention to the capitalization the N is uppercase okay we will set this div section equal to card so cards typically have an image we'll include an image element we'll set the source later they usually have a title we'll use an H2 element and a description we'll include a paragraph for our H2 title why don't you go ahead and type in your name I'll type in my YouTube channel name but feel free to use your own name then let's add a description for the description of Year card type in what you do for a living or if you're a student what are you studying for me personally I make YouTube videos and add a hobby of viers I make YouTube videos and play video games so far so good let's import our card component just to be sure that it's working within our app component I will at the top import the name of the component card from a file location these files are right next to each other so I will type SLC card. jsx within our app component we will return within the return statement list the component we would like to return we will return our card component to include a component within angle brackets type the name of the component these are typically in pairs you need an opening tag and a closing tag and there's our card so far we'll be applying some CSS styling momentarily there is a shortcut in place of using an opening and closing tag take the opening tag end it with a forward slash that's also valid let's head back to our card component we'll include an image within our opening image tag it is good practice to set the alt attribute just in case this image can't be displayed or if somebody is using a screen reader the alternate text will be displayed or read out loud will include a profile picture for us let's set the alternative text to be profile picture we're going to set the source attribute now I recommend pausing the video and finding a profile picture of yourself from you know Facebook or Twitter or whatever you use for social media pick a smaller picture something around 200 x 200 pixels would be decent if you don't want to follow along you can include a placeholder image just for this lesson which you can get from this site this will be an external URL https colon to slashes Via placeholder doc1 15 that will give you a placeholder image otherwise if you have an image you would like to use I'm using the profile picture from my YouTube channel all we got to do is place this image within our assets folder from our card class we will import that image import then we need a name for this import I'll name my import profile pick from a location so we need to navigate to the assets directory then get our image slash the assets directory slash the the name of the image so mine is profile and it's a JPEG yours is likely going to be different do pay attention to that profile. jpeg for the source attribute I will set the SQL to a set of curly braces then we will include our profile pick that we're importing there's my profile picture depending on the dimensions of your profile picture it might be fairly big you may want to choose a smaller image or otherwise within our CSS file we can change the dimensions of the picture okay let's head to our CSS stylesheet we already do have some Global CSS properties already applied but I'd like to start fresh let's delete everything within the CSS stylesheet that should eliminate all CSS within our web page we will select the name of the class card remember that with jsx we use class name not class with within our index CSS stylesheet let's select our card class I'm going to go through these CSS properties real quick we should already have some experience with CSS okay let's add a border border one pixel solid I'll set this to be black I do like using hsl values I'll pick a light gray color let's set the lightness to about 80 for the Border I'll set the Border radi to be 10 pixels to round the corners the corners should now be rounded as you can see here I'll add a box Shadow the first value is for the horizontal offset the second is for the vertical offset the third value is for the blur radius I'm going to pick a lighter color though so I'm going to select black change this to an hsl value but I'm going to change the transparency to be 10% so 0.1 that is not bad looking okay let's add a little bit of padding 20 pixels padding is found between the elements and the border so if I were to increase this we have more padding but let's stick with 20 I'll add some margin margin is for the space outside of the Border let's go with 10 pixels I'll text align Center to Center the elements within text align Center I'll set a Max width for the card to be 250 pixels then I will set the display to be an inline Block in case we have more cards they'll at least flow within our container if we have more because normally divs are Block Level elements okay so let's work on the card image next we'll head back to our card component class we'll add a class name to the image element class name equals let's say card image go back to our CSS stylesheet we are accessing our cards class then access the card image class within I will set a Max width I will set a Max WI width to be 60% of the width available I will set the height to be Auto to automatically resize if you would like a circular image you can set the Border radius to be 50% I'll add a little bit of margin on the bottom with margin bottom 10 pixels all right let's work on our title next going back to our card component let's add a class name the class name will be card- title going back to our CSS stylesheet we will select our card class then select the card title class with my card title I will set a font family to be pick a font I like Ariel I'll set a backup of s serif in case Ariel can't be displayed for some reason I'll set margin to be zero to remove any margin I'll set the text color to we'll set the color property to be pick a color again I'm using hsl values I'll set the lightness to be 20% now let's change our card text going back to our card component within our paragraph element we will set the class name to equal card- text going to our CSS stylesheet we will access the card class then access the card- text class I'll set the font family to be aerial as well and I will change the color I'll set the lightness to be 40% again I'm using hsl values uh maybe 30 I would say that looks decent enough we have now created and styled a card component within our app component we can reuse the card component however if I were to add another Well jsx elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag our return statements are only designed to return a single element you can enclose all elements within what is known as a fragment it's an empty set of angle brackets then technically we're only returning a single El element we now have two cards however they are identical though and we can use this card component whenever we want I can include four if I would like all right everybody so that is us making a card component in the next video I'll discuss props where each component can have different values because we don't want all of our components to look the same and that was some react practice by making a card component yo what's going on everybody so in today's video I'm going to show you a few ways in which we can style react components with CSS this topic doesn't include external Frameworks such as Tailwind or pre-processors such as SAS I'm going to cover a few of the more basic techniques including external modules and inline CSS styling we will need a component to work with let's begin with a button component let's go to our source folder new file button. jsx we'll create a function based comp component because we like function based components be sure to export it because I sometimes forget to do that so let's do it now export default the name of the component then we will return a single button element with text that says click me normally when setting a CSS class you use the keyword class however in jsx that's a reserved keyword we'll instead use class name with a capital N I'll set my class name to be button all right then we just need to import this button component going back to our app component that's the parent we will import button from its location SL button. jsx and now we have a button component to work with there's my button let's begin with external CSS styling we should already be a little familiar with it already heading to our index CSS stylesheet we can apply some Global Styles we will select the class name of button dot to select a class button let's apply the following CSS properties but feel free to make any changes or alterations I will begin with a background color I've already pre-picked a color personally I like using hsl values 200 for the Hue 100% for the saturation 50% for the lightness that will give you a light blue color for the font color that would be the color property I will set that to be white for padding let's say 10 pixels by 20 pixels border radius to round the corners I will set that to be five pixels border none to remove the Border then let's change our cursor to be a pointer when we hover over the button that's not a bad looking button I am zoomed in to like 300% just for this demonstration all right we have utilized an external CSS stylesheet they're easy to use for simple projects such as making a YouTube video tutorial it gives you flexibility with media queries and pseudo selectors you can use external stylesheets to apply Global Styles throughout your application however using external stylesheets can lead to naming conflicts especially when you have more components and classes to work with if you have a large web application you'll likely have all sorts of different buttons you would need a strong naming convention and good organization two buttons you may create might have the same class Name by mistake and with large applications it might be difficult to keep track of all the different class names moving on to Method two let's cut all of these properties save we're going to create a module now that's the second method we'll create a dedicated CSS stylesheet specifically for each component what you may see some developers do is they'll create a new folder specifically for their component let's create a new folder which we will name button the name of our component let's move our button component to the button folder let's move it be sure to update any Imports as well my app component is now importing the button component from the button directory within our button folder we'll create a new file this will be a CSS stylesheet which we will name the name of the component in this case button. module. CSS let's paste all of those properties that we cut before now from our button component we will need to import this module at the top we will import styles from the location of that module SL button. module. CSS for our class name we will use a set of curly braces to use a dynamic value our class name will equal our import of styles dot the name of the class button and there's our button again the thing about modules is that it avoids naming conflicts because a unique class is going to be generated for you via a hashing algorithm if I were to right click on this button and go to inspect this class name is unique it's generated via a hash so with modules we don't have to worry about naming conflicts modules are also convenient if each component has its own unique style however a few of the downsides though with using modules is that it does require additional setup and Global Style aren't applied easily you would have to import them from elsewhere and that's a whole thing let's remove our button component from the button directory let's put it back in source and delete our button directory going to our button component then remove the import as well we don't need that anymore now we're going to use inline Styles what you see some people do is they'll create a JavaScript object named styles Styles equals a set of curly braces for an object let's paste all of those CSS properties we're within jsx code right now we can't use any dashes we'll switch to a camel case naming convention all values Should Be Strings each property should be comma separated let's remove our class name we will set the style attribute to equal use a set of curly braces to insert a dynamic value we will insert our Styles object that contains all of these CSS properties and now we have done inline CSS styling inline CSS styling is convenient and easy easy to understand it prevents Global style conflicts because we're not working with class names it's great for isolated components with minimal styling such as a like button or a subscribe button however inline styling can be increasingly Less maintainable in large applications it reduces the readability of your components especially if you have a lot of CSS properties it's not great for any complex styling such as responsive CSS it tends to be better for components with minimal styling all right everybody so those those are three different ways in which we can style react components with CSS external which is great for Global Styles or small projects modules which is preferred for individual components that have their own unique Styles and inline which tends to be good for any small components with minimal styling use what's best for your project or your own personal preference or whatever your team prefers if you're working on a project together there's no one siiz fits-all approach unfortunately myself I prefer to use modules but throughout the series I'm going to be using a lot of external CSS just because our projects are really small and well everybody those are a few ways in which you can style react components with CSS hello everybody so today I got to explain props props short for properties they are readon properties that are shared between components a parent component can send data to a child component when you include a component within a parent you can send that that child component key value pairs in the last video we made cards but all of our cards were identical using props we can send a child component individual values so that they're all unique let's go over an example we're within our app component I will create a new component let's go to our source folder go to new file we will create a component for students to display student data student. jsx we need to create a function function student parenthesis curly braces then don't forget to export default the name of the component student in order for this component to accept props this function needs a props parameter props is going to be a JavaScript object so let's add our return statement we'll include a few HTML elements we'll start with a div within our div I will include a paragraph element within our paragraph We'll add the text Name colon space we'll include a set of curly braces to inject some JavaScript let's take our props this is an object access the name property however we still need to pass in a value for the key name so heading back to our app component we need to import the student component let's do so at the top import student from the location where the student file is found/ student. jsx let's include a student component within our app component student now if I would like to send some data to my student component student is going to be the child in this case app is the parent we'll need to list key value pairs the key will be name equals some value for the value associated with the name key let's say SpongeBob when I save and update everything we have the name SpongeBob when we send key value pairs to a component they're all stored within this props object to get the value associated with the key you type props dot the name of the key that will give you the associated value on my web page I'm going to zoom in a little bit just so you can see it that's good for now heading back to our app component let's send another key value pair let's send an age if you're going to store some data as a value if it's not a string literal you got to enclose it within curly braces let's say Spongebob his age is 30 we now have access to this age key heading back to our student component let's create a new paragraph age colon space to include some JavaScript we got to use a set of curly braces we are accessing the props object do access the key of age SpongeBob's age is 30 okay let's send is student is SpongeBob a student we'll create a key of is student equals add a set of cly braces is student will be a Boolean true or false SpongeBob is in boting school currently he is a student let's save heading back to our student component I'll include a new paragraph student colon space curly braces props do is student SpongeBob is a student that is true however our Boolean is not displaying so with a Boolean I recommend using the trary operator if is student within props is true then we'll return a string literal of yes otherwise we'll return a string literal of no let's update everything yes SpongeBob is a student you can place complex JavaScript code within your HTML code booleans don't display directly to the Dom you typically find them used within tary operators or some sort of conditional if some value is true return or do this if not do something else now if I were to pass in a Boolean value of false well that will change to no SpongeBob is not a student let's change that back to true now before I include a few more components I'm going to do a little bit of CSS styling just so that all of this is going to be more readable I'm going to zoom out to 100% where it was originally within my student component within the enclosing div element I will set a class name remember that with jsx you have to use class name not class because class is a reserved keyword let's name this class student then heading to our CSS stylesheet index.css feel free to clear out anything within here I will select the class of student I'll change the font family to be aiel I'll add a backup of s serif in case aiel can't display for some reason let's change the font size to 2 em for 200% I'll add a little bit of padding 10 pixels I'll add a border border one pixel solid pick a color I like hsl values I'll set the transparency down a little bit to like 80% let's go with like 50% lightness I'll remove any margin around the paragraph elements we are accessing the class student then access any paragraph elements margin zero okay that's not too bad so this is a student component to display some student data we'll reuse the student component but pass in different data each time we'll create a new student component this Student's name will be Patrick Patrick's age Patrick will be 42 is Patrick a student is student I will set that to be false let's update our web application and there is Patrick's data name Patrick age 42 student no let's add a few more student name equals Squidward Squidward's age will be 50 is student Squidward will not be a student that will be false then let's add Sandy she'll be the last student student name equals Sandy sy's age will be 27 is Sandy a student she will be that will be true there we are all right we have created four student components each has different values depending on what we pass into props we're going to move on to prop types prop types prop types are a mechanism that ensures that the past value is of the correct data type for example within props we have an age we would like to ensure that the age value passed in is a number not a string or a Boolean if it isn't then react can emit a warning within our console mostly for debugging purposes if you're working with props it is good practice to also use prop types so here's how to create prop types after our student function we'll type the name of the component student. prop types equals curly braces now we do have to import prop types it's found within the node modules folder where is it this should be an alphabetical order there it is prop types at the top of our jsx file we will import prop types from prop types prop-types within our prop types I would like to ensure that any name passed in is going to be a string if it's not we'll issue a warning within our console Name colon space prop types. string let's do this with age age will be a number age colon space prop types. number then is student is student will be a Boolean is student colon space prop types dob for Boolean all right and those are our prop types heading back to our app component for SpongeBob's age if I don't pass in a number let's say I pass in a string a string of 30 well this won't prevent the program from running but it will issue a warning within our console if we rightclick go to inspect go to console we can see a warning failed prop type invalid prop age of type string supplied to student expected number and here's a location so this is good for debugging it won't stop the application from running just issue a warning it is good practice ice to include prop types if you're accepting props then lastly we're going to discuss default props default props are default values for props in case they are not passed from the parent component let's say we create a new student component but we don't pass in a name we can add a default value such as guest just in case that value isn't passed in one way or another okay let's add default props down here student. default props equals set of curly braces for the name the default value will be guest age will be zero is student will be false to test this let's go to our app component we'll create a new student component but don't pass in any props we'll create an empty student component with no props that appears to work the name is guessed the age is zero student is set to know so if I were to include a name let's say name equals Larry well Larry's name is going to be set we didn't include any key value pairs for age or is student we ended up using the default values zero and no all right everybody so those are props they are readon properties that are shared between components a parent component can send data to a child component when you include a component you can send that component key value pairs which allows you to reuse that component but have unique data and those are props with react hey sup everybody in today's video I'm going to give you an introduction to conditional rendering in react conditional rendering allows you to control what gets rendered in your application based on certain conditions by utilizing conditional rendering we can show hide or change components here's an example we'll create a user greeting component let's go to our source folder new file user greeting and this will be a jsx file I will be using function based components function the name of the component user greeting we will have one parameter props we learned about props in the last video before I forget I'm going to export default the component name just so that we can import it later heading back to our app component we will return a user greeing component user greeting by using props we'll send two key value pairs to our user greeing component is logged in this will be a Boolean value we'll check to see if we're logged in or not and a username username equals this is a string so we do not need a placeholder type in your name or username then we do need to import user greeting import user greeting from a location. slash user greeting. jsx let's save everything head to our user greeting component we have these two key value pairs that are stored within our props object I'll use an if statement to check to see if we're logged in or not if props is an object we will access props followed by dot is logged in is this true or not not if it is then let's return an H2 element with text of Welcome I'd like to include some JavaScript I'll use curly braces let's take props dot our username let's see if this works welcome bro code or whatever your name is so what if we're not logged in I will set is logged in to be false well nothing appears to happen going back to our user greeting let's add an else statement else we will return an H2 element with text of please log in to continue please log in to continue within our function based component we can check some logic using an if statement if some condition is true return this if not return something else now Technic technically you don't need the else statement you could just say return because when you return you exit this would work too as you can see I don't think it's as explicit as using an lse statement another option is to use the tary operator which we learned in JavaScript we will return check props do is logged in add a question mark is this true or is it false if it's true then we'll return an H2 element that says welcome I'll add some JavaScript props do username I'm going to close this menu just so we can see if this condition is true return this otherwise add a colon we'll return something else we'll add an H2 element please log into continue this statement is pretty lengthy I'm going to put each part of the statement on a new line just so we can read it easily if is logged in is true return this H2 element if not return this H2 element currently we're logged in that is true if I set this to be false well then we get that login prompt please log in to continue you'll more commonly see people use tary operators rather than IFL statements just because they're more concise let's apply some CSS styling going back to our app component we'll set is logged in to be true We'll add a class name to each of these H2 components class name equals the first H2 element if our condition is true we'll have a class name of Welcome Dash message our second H2 element will have a class name of login D prompt going to our CSS stylesheet let's select the class of Welcome message I'll apply the following CSS properties let's set the font size to be 2.5 em I'll change the background color I like using hsl values I'll go with this shade of green let's change the font color to be white I'll add a little bit of padding 10 pixels I'll add a border radius around the corners then set margin to be zero here is our user greeting component if the user is logged in let's style the login prompt class next do login prompt really I'll just copy these properties but we'll change the background color let's change the background color to be red all right let's set is logged in to be false then our user greeing component should have those different CSS properties please log in to continue if I set that to be true well then we're logged in welcome your username within our user greeting this tary operator is very verbose here's another way in which we can use the tary operator in this situation let's create two constants const the first will be welcome message be sure not to include any dashes though separately we'll store these H2 elements I'm getting a copy of this first H2 element we'll store that within our welcome message just so we can read it I'm going to place each line on a new line then let's create another constant const login prompt be sure to eliminate any dashes we will be using a camel case naming convention take our second H2 cut it paste it and there we go I find that a lot easier to read so we're going to take our condition is logged in if that's true we'll return our constant our welcome message otherwise we'll return our other constant our login prompt and that will work still the same let's set that to be false please log to continue set it back to be true welcome your username I find this syntax a lot easier to read now it is good practice if you're accepting props to set up prop types just in case the values that are passed in are not of the correct data type you'll at least get a warning for debugging purposes it's a good habit that we should develop we learned about prop types in the last video so at the top let's import prop types from prop-types after our function take our user greeing component do propop types equals take our keys is logged in the value with this Associated key should be a Boolean prop that's capital T types dob then a string for username user name prop types. string all right the last thing we're going to do is set up default props what if somebody's logged in but they don't have a username we'll set a default for the username as guest so after our prop types we'll set up some default props again take user greeting that's the name of our component. default props equals is logged in will be false and username will be G if there's no username passed in all right going back to our app component if a user is logged in but there's no username let's eliminate that we'll get the welcome message of Welcome guest now if a user is not logged in regardless we don't display the username all right everybody so that's conditional rendering you can check some sort of condition based on if that condition is true or false we can show hide or change components there's many different ways in which you can do that and well everybody that is an introduction to conditional rendering in react hey everybody I have a huge video for you today today we're going to talk about rendering lists in reactjs this can be pretty complex we'll go through it step by step what we'll do in this tutorial is create a new component to hold our list let's go to our source folder create a new file I'll name this component list this will be a Js x file to finish creating this component this will be a function based component with the name of list then be sure to export it export default list we'll start with something very simple we'll create an array of fruit this will be const fruits equals think of some fruit for me I'll pick an apple Orange banana coconut and a pineapple let me show you what would happen if we were to return our array within our list component we will return our array of fruits but we will need to import it going back to the app component we will import our list component import list from a location . SL list. jsx we need a return statement to be sure you have one we will return a list component and here is our list let me zoom in it's all one big string Apple orange banana coconut pineapple heading back to our list component we need to convert our array of strings into an array of list item elements we can use the built-in map method to do that we'll create a new array of list items the map method is going to return a new array after running it through a function const list items equals take our original array a fruits use the built-in map method then we'll either pass in a callback a function expression or an arrow function we'll use Arrow functions because I like Arrow functions for every fruit in fruits Arrow meaning do this we'll create a new list item element that has the text of our fruit the array item we're not going to return our fruits array we're going to return an unordered list we're going to insert some JavaScript with curly braces will include our list items it's an array of list items and here's our array whoops but I forgot to enclose fruit with curly braces my mistake they much better or if you prefer we can turn this unordered list into an ordered list with a pair of O tags o there they're all numbered that's how to render a simple array if you're working with an array of strings and you'd like to sort this array beforehand you can use the sort method fruit do sort the sort method will sort an array in place however this doesn't work with numbers because we're sorting lexico graphically we would treat numbers and symbols as characters more on that later let's go over example two we'll convert our array of strings into an array of objects each object will have a name property and calories calories per serving so let's enclose all of our elements within a set of curly braces to make them objects I'm going to place each of these objects on a new line just so that I can read it more easily each of these objects will have a name property the name property will be set to the original string for our array the first object will have a name of Apple let's add calories too calories per serving I did a quick Google search of some the calories per serving for these fruits I don't know how accurate these are but they seemed right our first object has a name of Apple calories is set to 95 name orange calories 45 name banana calories 105 name coconut coconut calories 159 name pineapple calories 37 all right we now have an array of objects there's a few changes we're going to make if I run this again our list isn't rendering I need to display the name property of each fruit fruit. name property we have one issue behind the scenes I'm going to right click go to inspect then go to console warning each child in a list should have a unique key prop react wants us to assign a key to each list item each key should be unique in my array of objects each fruit has a unique name I could use that we will set the key attribute to equal include some JavaScript fruit. name that warning should go away which it did if there's a possibility that two objects can share the same name you'll want to use some sort of unique ID in a real world scenario if you're pulling data from a database each row of data is going to have some sort of unique ID so we're going to mimic that let's add a new property for id id will be one for Apple these will be in ascending order orange will have an ID of two banana is three coconut is four pineapple is five we'll set the key to be each ID this would be much better than using the name you can have a naming conflict if two objects share the same name like if these were people you could have two people named Bob that warning should be gone which it is react would like a unique key for each item just so it can more easily keep track of items being inserted and removed along with each element I'm going to display the calories next to each element so we'll make a few changes I'm going to put these HTML elements on a new line for readability after the fruit's name I'm going to add a colon a non-breaking space character and Pand nbsp for space oh then not a semicolon forgot about that then we'll insert some JavaScript fruit. calories for the calories of each fruit I'll make it bold I'll enclose our calories with a pair of bold tags which is just B now we're going to sort the items in our list we'll do that before the map method I'm going to sort our array of objects by their name property we'll take fruits use the sort method the sort method will sort an array in place we'll write a custom sorting function we have two parameters A and B A for the first item B for the second then we iterate over the entire array we need an arrow meaning do something to lexicographically sort string properties within an array we can use the following method we'll take the name property of a use the built-in local or local some people say compare method I misspelled that yeah I can't spell compare to b.n name that should sort our aray of objects by their name property for reverse order let me turn this line into a comment this is alphabetical for reverse alphabetical order we just have to replace a with B and B with a there pineapple orange coconut banana apple with apple being at the bottom let's sort by calories fruits. sort this one's easier again we have our parameters a comma B Arrow the calories of a a. calories minus b. calories that one's easy we have pineapple at the top followed by orange apple banana coconut this is in numeric order for reverse numeric order reverse numeric or descending you could say the calories of B minus the calories of a now we have coconut at the top with pineapple at the bottom with the least amount of calories in this next section I'm going to demonstrate to you how we can filter objects by a certain criteria we'll filter anything that's greater than 100 calories we'll create a new array of fruit that has low calories we'll create a new array const low cal fruit equals take our original array of fruits use the built-in fil method we'll have one parameter of fruit examine each fruit in our array of fruits Arrow then a condition here's the criteria check the calories property of our fruit if it's less than 100 filter it and add it to a new array instead of displaying our array of fruits let's display our new array of low calorie fruit oh that should be plural local fruits when we create our array of list items replace fruits with local fruits and any instance of fruit with lcal fruit singular so we have three instances of fruit let's replace those let me clean this up a little feel free to pause the video if you need to write this down we have three fruits that are low calories the calories is less than 100 let's find any high calorie fruits we can just copy this line of code paste it but change the condition examine the calories of each fruit filter it out if the calories are greater than or equal to 100 the name of this array will be high Cal fruits replace low cal fruits with high Cal fruits replace low cal fruit with high Cal fruit singular and do that for the other instances as well there we are we have two fruits that are high in calories bananas and coconuts that is US using the filter method to filter out list items let's replace High Cal fruits with fruits high Cal fruit with fruit to display our original array for the next part of this lesson we're going to transform this list component so it's reusable with different lists currently the way that we set this up is that each list component that we create has its own list of fruit so we're going to make some changes let's cut our list of fruits going to the parent component of app we'll paste our list of fruits then pass it as props to our list component with our list component we will have a key of items equals insert some JavaScript our list of fruits let's also add a category key category equals for my category let's say fruits eventually we'll add an H3 heading we're now going to send all of this data to the list component but we have to set up props with in the list function we have a parameter of props we'll access the items of props to get our fruit we'll create const item list equals not to be confused with list items list items is what we get after we map it item list equals props do items and remember that items is our fruits array replace fruits with item list replace fruit with item do that here here and here there's our list again if you're going to sort or use the filter method be sure it's item list not fruits because now list is a reusable component I'll add our Category 2 that's stored within props const category equals props do category currently we're returning a single ordered list I'll also include an H3 element include some JavaScript we need curly braces add our category however with our return statement we can only return a single element or many elements that are wrapped within a fragment let's create a fragment that will enclose all of our markup there we are going back to our app component let's create a new list just to make sure that our list component is reusable let's copy our array of fruits paste it we'll create an array of vegetables the IDS will be 6 7 8 9 10 the name of my first item will be potatoes calories 110 per serving celery calories will be 15 carrots calories 25 corn calories 63 broccoli calories 50 now we should be able to create a new list component within our return statement we're going to need a fragment again we'll return a second list item component the items will be vegetables the category will be a string of vegetables Bo boom there we go here's our second list component so our list component is now reusable we can pass in many different types of lists to make this look better let's apply some CSS styling we'll have to set a class name first our H3 element will have a class name equal to list- category our ordered list will have a class name of list items all right going to our CSS stylesheet index.css let's work on our list category first use dot to select a class list category I'm just going to run through these real quick I'm going to make sure I'm zoomed in to 100 because I was zoomed in beforehand font size 2.5 em font weight will be gold pick a color I'm going to stick with hsl values I'll set the lightness to be 20% I'll add a little bit of margin on the bottom 10 pixels text align Center I'll add a border three pixel solid I'll add a border radius to round the corners and a background color pick a color again I'll use hsl this one I pre-picked already 185 100% 50% % that's not a bad looking color pick whatever color you would like let's work on our list item elements we need to select the class of list items do list items select each list item within this class I'll increase the font size to be 2 em I'll remove the list style but you don't have to list Style will be none pick a color again I'm using hsl values I'll set the lightness to be 25% text align Center and margin will be zero all right now when I hover over one of these list items I'll apply a hover effect take our class list items take each list item access the hover sudo class I'll change the brightness the color will be something a little bit brighter I'll set the lightness to be 45% and then the cursor will be a pointer yeah not bad that's how we can apply some CSS styling to list components all right heading back to our app component what if we have an empty list for example with our fruits I'm going to cut it we can use conditional rendering to render our list only if there's elements let's put those back we're going to write some JavaScript we need some curly braces let's take our array of fruits access the length property is it greater than zero question mark if it is we'll return our list component colon if it's false we can return null let's do that with our vegetables too take our array of vegetables access the length property is it greater than zero tary operator if it is return our list component if not we can return null if one of these lists doesn't have any elements we won't render that component there is a short hand to the tary operator we don't need to write or else return null what we'll use instead of the tary operator is the and logical operator we can effectively shortcircuit the first expression then we don't need colon null it's a little less code our list component will always be true because it exists however the first expression might not be so if this condition is false we don't render this if it is true we will render this let's try that again let's remove these elements we don't display the fruits list component and we will not display the vegetable list component this is known as short circuiting one thing to consider what if our category is missing let's remove our category from fruits well I would like to add some sort of placeholder here or what if one of these arrays was missing well nothing displays not even vegetables we should add some default props in case one of these properties is missing so going back to our list component before we export it let's set up some default props take our component name list. default props equals within a set of curly braces let's set our category category property to be category as a placeholder if for some reason these components don't have a category We'll add a placeholder of category which at least looks better if we're missing an array that's a bigger problem let me go to inspect then console we're trying to map something that's undefined we have no array to work with so nothing is rendering so as a backup within default props let's set our items to be an empty array items will be an empty array if one of these arrays was missing for some reason at least the category is displayed as well as the subsequent components at least something will display okay then lastly as good practice if we're accepting props we should set up prop types I'll walk you through it if you're just joining us with prop types if the incorrect data type is passed into props when we debug it'll give us a warning to use prop types we have to import it at the top of our list component we will import prop types from prop types take our component of list list. prop types equals set of curly braces for our category this will be a string category colon space prop types. string add a comma for another line okay this is where it's going to get tricky we have an array of objects we'll access the items property items colon space prop types I'm going to move down a little bit dot we have an array array of we have an array of objects prop types. shape method we have to define the shape of each object object each object is going to have its own data types we have a number string then number we're defining an object we need a set of curly braces ID colon prop types do number comma for another property I'll put the next one on a new line for readability we have a name property which will be a string prop types. string then calories prop types. number and that's it let's head back to our app component our prop types should raise a warning if some of our data is of the wrong data type for example let's say that calories is now the string Apple maybe somebody mistyped it twice you can see that right here it changed let's go to inspect console and here's our warning because we have prop type set up invalid prop items index zero calories of type string if we didn't have prop type setup we wouldn't receive that warning this may go unnoticed it is good practice if you're accepting props to also set up prop types it's a little more complicated if you have an array of objects but here are the steps all right everybody I know this was a massive topic thank you all for watching feel free to take some time to study and work with this before moving on to the next topic if you would like we did Cover a lot of material and well those are various ways in which we can render lists in react hey uh so today I'm going to explain click events and how to handle them in react a click event is an interaction when a user clicks on a specific element we can respond to clicks by passing a call back to the onclick event handler in this example we'll create a button let's create a button component go to new file button. jsx we will use a function base component function button then be sure to export it export default button going back to our parent component of app we will need to import our button import button from its location button. jsx then we will create one button component going to our button component we will return a single button element the button will have text of Click me hey for fun I'm just going to add it an emoji but you don't have to and I will zoom in so you can see it many HTML elements have an onclick event handler we can set the SQL to a JavaScript callback but we need a function to work with So within our button function we can write an inner function const handle click I will assign this equal to either a function expression or an arrow function I like Arrow functions so I'm going to stick with an arrow function when we click on the button what do we want to do let's console.log the word ouch so we have our function we will set the onclick event handler equal to a callback a call back to this function when we click on the button do this if I went to my console inspect console Let me refresh this if I click on the button we execute this code we will output the word ouch every time I click the button if your function has parameters there's one change we'll need to make let's create a second function const handle Click 2 this function will have a parameter of name we'll use an arrow function we will console.log I'll use a template string let's display the name stop clicking me for the onclick event handler we will set a call back of handle click to but we have parameters that means we need to send a matching number of arguments I will send my first name but feel free to use your name I didn't click on the button yet I'm going to go to inspect console uh Let me refresh all this I didn't click on the button yet but we've already called that function if you add a set of parentheses after a call back you'll invoke it right away so we don't want to do that if we have arguments we need to send to a function we could wrap this call back within a function expression or an arrow function let's use an arrow function when we click on the button do this that will prevent us from calling this function right away so let's refresh everything then when I click on the button then we execute this code bro stop clicking me bro stop clicking me bro stop clicking me so that's how to send arguments to a function now in this next example We'll add some conditions let's set the onclick attribute to be a call back to handle click if you have more than one line of code for your arrow function you'll need to use a set of curly braces let's add a count variable let count equal Z with our handle click function let's have one parameter a name what would we like to do let's check to see if our count variable is less than three if it is let's increase count by one then console.log I'll use a template string let's add our name parameter you clicked me add a placeholder count time or times else if the user clicked me more than three times let's console. log a different message let's say add a placeholder name stop clicking me with the onclick event Handler we have a parameter that means we have to wrap this call back within a function expression or an arrow function let's use an arrow function for Simplicity we'll pass in a first name pass in your own first name so let's save and refresh everything go to inspect console when I click on the button once it's going to display bro you clicked me one time bro you clicked me two times bro you clicked me three times after the third time we'll display a different message bro stop clicking me bro stop clicking me bro stop clicking Me So within your functions you can write some conditions now I need to explain the event parameter let's recreate that handle click function const handle click equals with click events were automatically provided with an event argument it's an object that describes the event that occurred but as a parameter people usually shorten the event parameter to be simply e let's print our event console.log e our event we'll need to set the onclick event handler we have one parameter so we need to wrap this within an arrow function handle click for the arrow function we'll have e for the parameter and E for an argument for the handle click function let's click on the button we're now outputting the event its type is synthetic base event and it has all of these properties and methods such as where you clicked on the screen there's a timestamp and a Target by utilizing this event object that gives us many different possibilities for this demonstration let's change the text content of the button so there should be a Target property here I am going to change the text content that should be a property yep there it is so what we'll do after clicking on the button we will access that event object follow this with DOT that's the property accessor we're selecting the inner target object then selecting the text content property let's set that equal to be ouch so now when you click on the button the text of the button should change to ouch I'm going to add an emoji too there we go okay let's try this again this will be fun click me ouch there's also the on doubleclick event handler instead of onclick you'll say say on double click so when we click on the button once now nothing happens but once I double click that's when we'll execute this function now I'm going to double click ouch if you need to handle a double click you just have to use the on double click event handler all right let's move on from using a button this time let's use an image in my assets folder I do have my profile picture from my YouTube channel find a profile picture of yourself or a picture you like we're going to create a new component let's go to our source folder I will name this component profile picture. jsx we will create a function with the name of profile picture then be sure to export it export default profile picture then going back back to our app component we will import our profile picture component from its location profile picture. jsx let's include our profile picture component instead of our button all right so within our profile picture component I will store a URL within a constant constant image URL I will list a relative file path so my image is within my assets folder my file location but it might be different for you mine is going to be SL Source SL assets slash the name of the image including the extension mine is profile. jpeg we will return an image on lint I AMG for an image element I will set the source equal to some JavaScript I need to set a curly braces I will set it equal to my image URL and let's see if that worked yes it did but I'm going to zoom out to like 150 my image is small let's add a handle click function const handle click equals an arrow function to test it let's console.log the word ouch then we'll need to set the onclick event handler within our image on click equals a callback to handle click so let's save and refresh everything let's go to inspect console when you click on your image it should display the word ouch every time you click it let's utilize the event object that's generated we have one parameter e for our event that means we'll have to change the call back to Be an Arrow function e for the parameter Arrow handle click we have one argument of e so what should we do now when we click on the image let's hide the image we'll need to access that event object access the target object that's found within access its style then the display property we will set the display to be none when we click on it so then if you were to click on your image it should disappear so by accessing the event object that gives us a load of different possibilities for what we can do all right everybody so that is an introduction to handling click events in react a click event is an interaction when a user clicks on a specific element we can respond to clicks by passing a call back to the onclick event handler and well everybody that is an introduction to click events in react hey what's going on everybody in today's video I'm going to explain the usate react hook and near the end of this video we're going to create a reactive counter program so sit back relax and enjoy the show I haven't explained what react hooks are yet a react Hook is a special function that allows functional components to use react features without writing class components this was a change made in react version 16.8 basically we no longer need to write class components we can write function-based components that use react hooks to use react features there are many react hooks if a function begins with use it's probably a react hook use State use effect use context use reducer use callback and more UST state is the most widely used UST state is a react hook that allows the the creation of a stateful variable and a Setter function to update its value in the virtual Dom basically by using the usate hook we can create not just a variable but a stateful variable when you update this variable that change will be reflected in the virtual domum normal variables don't when you use the UST State hook you're given a variable and a Setter function specifically for that variable so what we'll do in this example is create a new component going to our source folder we're going to create a new file we'll name this component my component we use react hooks in function based components so make sure you're not writing a class component with this component we will export it export default my component then be sure to import this because I'm probably going to forget if we don't do it now so we will import my component from its location slash my component and this is a jsx file let's return one my component and we are ready to begin in order to use a react hook we need to import it at the top of this component we will import the react Library however we don't need the entire react Library we can use object destructuring to extract individual variables or functions I would just like the UST State function we don't need the entire react library from its location react we now have access to this UST State function using the UST State function we'll create a stateful variable and a Setter function to update that variable so let's declare const we're going to use a set of straight brackets for array destructuring equals use State function the use State function returns an array with two ele elements a variable and a Setter function we're going to use array destructuring to destructure these two elements we'll create a stateful variable for name then we're given a Setter function specifically for this variable a common naming convention is to type set than the variable name with camel case naming convention and that's it if we ever need to change the value of the stateful variable we have to do so with this Setter it's a function at the bottom we're going to return return a div element within this div element we'll create a paragraph element and a button we'll begin with a paragraph element that has text of name and I'm going to zoom in a little bit I will insert some JavaScript using curly braces let's display our name following our paragraph element let's include a button the button will have an onclick attribute equal to a JavaScript function so we need a set of curly braces to embed that let's create a function to update name for the text of the button let's say set name all right now we just need to declare this function I'll use an arrow function const update name equals Arrow function so what would we like to do okay let's attempt to set our name equal to type your name or some other name I'm just going to type in SpongeBob if I click on this button we should update our name right well that doesn't appear to work so if I were to console.log my name variable then attempt to update it using this button if I were to go to my console hold on I'm going to use let so we can update it if I attempt to change this name of the variable it does so within our console but it doesn't update in react the virtual Dom is still displaying the previous state so if I would like to display any changes I will want to use that Setter instead of setting our name equal to a new value I'm going to change this back to be a constant we will use the setter function and pass in a new value so let me type in a new value and that should work we have updated our name when you use the setter function of a stateful variable it will trigger a render of the virtual Dom normal variables don't that's why the UST State react Hook is useful we can create a stateful variable when the stateful variable gets updated with its Setter function it triggers a rerender of the virtual Dom with the usate function you can pass in an initial state currently we're not passing in anything for the initial state State I will set this to be guested when I refresh everything and start over the initial state is guessed whatever value you pass in to the UST State hook then I can set my name again to something else now we're going to create an age variable and increment it const we're going to use array to structuring we need a stateful variable like age and a Setter function for that age set age equals use state if you would like an initial value you can place that within the UST State function I'll set the initial value of AG to be zero I'm going to copy this paragraph and this button change name to be age we'll create a function to increment age the text on the button will be increment age now we just need this function const increment age I'll use an arrow function to increment our age we will use the set age function let's take our age + one so our initial value for our age is zero but every time I click on the button we will update the value of that variable so every time I click the button button we're increasing our age by one or even a different number this time I'll increase our age by two on each button click so we start at zero then we'll increment by two 2 4 6 8 10 now this time we'll create a Boolean variable and toggle it between being true and false using the US state hook we will create const is employed the setter function will be set is employed equals the use State hook I would like an initial value a false let's create a paragraph element and a button I will set the text of the paragraph to be is employed instead of displaying a Boolean directly let's use the tary operator for conditional rendering is employed if that is true will display yes otherwise no when we click on the button let's create a function to toggle toggle employed status that's kind of a Long Function name all right let's create a function const toggle employed status equals an arrow function we will use the setter function set is employed pass in a new value let's switch this value from being false to true and true to false every time we click the button since this is a Boolean we can use the not logical operator to reverse it so let's say not is employed and let's see if this works is employed no oh let's change the text on the button too toggle status there we go all right when we click on the button we can toggle this Boolean from being true to false and false to true and this should happen every time I click the button as a project what we're going to do now is create a counter program so let's close out of my component we'll create a new component for a counter component counter. jsx this will be a function base component function counter then be sure to export it export default counter going back to our app component we will import our counter component from its location counter. jsx then we will include one counter component and that's it in order for us to use the US state hook we have to import it from the react Library import react we'll use object destructuring just to get the UST State hook and nothing else from its location of react all we need is one variable a counter let's say const we'll use array destructuring create a stateful variable of count and a Setter function for that count set count equals the use State hook would we like an initial value for count we would like the initial value to be zero we'll create a few functions to increment decrement and reset the counter const increment equals I'll use an arrow function to update the count to increment it we will use the set count function the value we'll pass in is Count + one then let's do this for decrement const decrement count minus one then reset const reset for set count we'll pass in zero to reset the count now we're going to return some elements we'll also style this with CSS let's begin with the div element I'm going to scroll down a little bit my div element will have a class name name equal to counter- container I will create a paragraph element with a class name equal to count display to display the number for the text of the paragraph I will insert some JavaScript and display our count variable we'll create three buttons for the first we'll create a button element this button will have a class name of counter- button the onclick attribute will be set equal to a JavaScript function this first button will be the decrement button for the unclick attribute we will set this equal to the decrement function for the text on the button we'll say decrement and there's our first button so let's copy this button paste it the second button will be for reset the text will be reset then the third button will be increment onclick will be the increment function the text will be increment all right and that's all that we need let's check it for functionality to be sure that everything works we can increment this number we can decrement it and we can reset it so for the icing on the cake let's style it with CSS going to our index CSS stylesheet we'll apply the following CSS let's select our counter container do counter container I will text align Center change the font family I will pick a s serif font of Arial with a backup of s serif next we'll select the count display select the class of count display that would be this number will increase the font size to something massive like 10 em RM works too oh okay that's a little too big but I am zoomed in actually you know what that's perfect I will set the margin top to be zero to close this Gap and I will set the margin on the bottom to be 50 pixels then let's work on the counter buttons next select the class of counter button I will set the width to be 150 pixels the height to be 50 pixels the font size to be 1.5 em I will set the font weight to be bold set the margin to be 0 pixels by 5 pixels this would be for the left and right of the buttons change the background color pick a color that you like I'm going to use hsl values though that's pretty good I will set the color of the font to be white remove the border border none set the Border radius to round the corners five pixels and change our cursor to be a pointer if we hover over the button when we hover over the button I'm going to change the background color of the button so with the counter button class with the counter button class we will select the hover sudo class we'll take our background color decrease the lightness to be 10% darker there we are and that is all the CSS styling that we need we have our counter program we can increment the counter we can decrement it and we can reset it all right everybody so that is the US state react hook it allows the creation of a stateful variable and a Setter function to update its value in the virtual Dom when you include the UST State hook you're given an array of two elements we use array destructuring to create a stateful variable and a Setter function to update that variable and well everybody that is the UST State hook in react yo yo yo yo yo what's going on people so today I got to explain the onchange event handler in react onchange is an event handler used primarily with form elements including but not limited lied to input text area select and radio buttons onchange triggers a function every time the value of the input changes so let me give you an example we will be using the UST State hook so we need to import it import react I would like the use State Hook from react using the use State hook we're going to create a name variable a stateful variable const name and we need a Setter function for this variable set name equals the use State hook you can set an initial value I'll set mine to be an empty string I will be returning a div element to enclose all of our markup within my div element I will create an input element and here's my input element I will set the value of the input element to be some JavaScript my stateful name variable then I will set the onchange event handler to be a reference to a JavaScript function which we still need to create this will be a call back let's create a function to handle a name change it's going to be similar to handle click function handle name change we have one parameter an event that's going to be provided to us when we change the value of this input element I will invoke our set name function we will set our name variable to be access our event object access its Target then get the value property onchange is going to be set equal to a call back to this function when we type something or somehow change the value within here call the this function and then afterwards I will include a paragraph element that has the text of name and include some JavaScript I will include my name variable so what should happen is when I type in a name it will update in real time with use State I can set the initial value to be something too I'll set my initial value to be guested the onchange event handler triggers a function every time the value of the input changes right now we have an initial value if I start deleting this my name is going to update this time we'll create an input element for a number instead of text I will create a stateful variable for a quantity as if we're ordering something quantity and we need a Setter function set quantity equals the use State hook would we like an initial value not yet but we'll get to that later I will create a function to handle quantity change it's the same formula as before we will be provided with an event so let's write a parameter for that we will use the setter function for the quantity set quantity we'll pass in Access our event access its Target then access its value then we need some HTML elements let me scroll down I will create an input element I will set the value of this element to be our quantity then I will set the onchange event handler to be a call back to a job JavaScript function handle quantity change I will set the type of this element to be a number type equals number afterwards I will add a paragraph with our quantity and display our quantity variable so now we have arrows to select a number I will update the quantity to be one two 3 4 five I'll set an initial value of one let's pretend that we're ordering something we're going to assume that the user wants to buy at least one of something that's how you can use onchange to reflect a number that's changing within an input element all right now we're going to create a text area a user is going to be buying something we'll have a user leave a comment I will create const comment set comment equals use State I'll set the initial state of my comment to be an empty string then I'll create a function to handle comment change function handle comment change we have one parameter and event we will use our Setter for our comment then pass in Access our event access its Target then access its value then we need our HTML elements we will create a text area element I will set the value to be our comment variable then set the onchange event handler to be a call back to handle comment change I'm also going to add a placeholder for some placeholder text placeholder equals in my specific example this text area will be for specific delivery instructions if somebody's shopping on your site and they order something they might want to provide additional delivery instructions leave package on the back porch ring the doorbell after the delivery is complete stuff like that so for my placeholder I'll type in enter delivery instructions and there's my placeholder text then just to see if this updates I'll add a paragraph element with my comment then insert my comment variable all right let's see if this works leave package on front porch and avoid the killer Chihuahua that's how we can use onchange with a text area all right the next one's going to be a little more complicated we're going to use a select element for a drop- down menu we'll create a drop- down menu for a payment is somebody going to pay with a Visa a MasterCard a gift card const payment set payment this will be a payment type we'll use use State I will set the initial value to be an empty string then we need a Handler function function handle payment change we have one parameter and event then we'll use that Setter function for the payment set payment event access its Target then the value our select element has as a pair of tags we'll Place option elements within our select element the opening select element is going to have a value equal to our payment variable I will set the onchange event handler equal to a call back to the handle payment change function we have some options within our select element the text on my first stop option will be select an option so now my drop- down menu has select an option for this option's value I will set it to be an empty string this will be the default let's create another option the text on this option element will be a Visa if somebody's paying with a Visa card the value will be a string of Visa besides the defaults we do have an option for Visa then MasterCard Master Card the value will be a string of MasterCard and then a gift card gift card the value will be gift card so besides our default we have Visa MasterCard and gift card after our select element I'll create a paragraph the text on the paragraph will be payment then I'll display our payment stateful variable when I select Visa our payment is going to update with Visa Mastercard and gift card with use State I can even set an initial value I could set the initial value to be for example Visa Master Card or a gift card but I'll keep it as an empty string so we get that default text of Select an option the last form element I'll cover is radio buttons and these are going to be the most complicated we'll create a pair of two radio buttons for a delivery method either pickup or a delivery does somebody want to come into a store to pick up our package or is a driver going to take it to their residence I will create comp let's say shipping for the shipping method and a Setter function for set shipping equals use State for the time being I will set the initial state to be an empty string we'll create a Handler function function handle shipping change we have one parameter of event I will use that Setter function of set shipping access our event argument access its Target access its value within our HTML markup we're going to create a pair of radio buttons we'll create a label we need a pair of label elements the text on the first label will be pickup are we going to pick up our package from a store we'll create a second label I'll just copy what we have paste it the second label will be for a delivery within my label I'll create an input element I will set the type to equal radio I will set the value of this radio button to be pickup I'll place the these additional properties on a new line just for readability I will set the checked attribute equal to a JavaScript expression let's check to see if our shipping stateful variable is strictly equal to our value of pickup this will evaluate to be true or false if this expression is true then we'll trigger our onchange vent Handler and set it equal to a JavaScript function it's going to be a call back to handle shipping change let's copy this input element then within our second label paste it but we'll change our value to be pick up to delivery within our checked property check to see if shipping is strictly equal to delivery if this expression is true then checked will be true through this will trigger the onchange event handler just to reflect the change I'm going to add a paragraph element with text of shipping I will insert some JavaScript I will insert our shipping stateful variable I'm going to add a break after our first label just for readability I think that looks better if I were to select pickup the shipping method changes to pickup we're going to pick up our delivery from a nearby store if I change it to delivery the shipping method changes to delivery with the US state hook we can set an initial State let's assume that if somebody is ordering something from our site they will want it delivered I will set the initial state to be delivery and that did update but if somebody does want to pick it up they can easily just change that by selecting this radio button all right everybody so that is the onchange event handler it's used primarily with form elements including but not limited to input text area select and radio buttons onchange triggers a function every time the value of the input changes so for example if I were to type in my name into this input element that change is immediately going to be reflected in real time and well everybody that is the onchange vent Handler in react hey what's going on everybody in today video we're going to create a Color Picker program using react this serves as more of an exercise now that we know how the UST State Hook and the onchange event handlers work so let's get started all right let's begin everybody within our source folder we'll create a new file for a Color Picker component this will be a jsx file we will use function based components function Color Picker there are no parameters then let's be sure to export this export default Color Picker we need to return something for the time being I'm going to return a fragment just so that everything works going back to our app component we will import our Color Picker component from its location SLC colorpicker djsx then let's include one Color Picker component and that is all we need with the app component heading to the Color Picker component we will need to import the UST State hook import from react we'll use object destructuring just to get the UST State Hook from react within our Color Picker function at the top we'll use the UST State hook to create a stateful color variable const we're going to use array D structuring and create a color and a Setter function for that color we will use the use State hook for the color if you would like to set an initial color you can do that I recommend using hexadecimal values to keep it simple for example if you would like white that would be 6fs personally I'm a fan of using hsl values for Hue saturation and lightness but that can get kind of complicated you would need to pass in a JavaScript object with those three properties we stick with heximal values just to keep it simple then we'll create our HTML elements So within the return statement I will create a div element this div element will have a class name of Color Picker container with react when using CSS I like to use a hyphenated naming convention this development will contain everything we need for our Color Picker component within this St elment I will create an H1 element for a heading The Heading will be Color Picker after this H1 element I will create a nested div element this nested div element will have a class name equal to color- display this is what's going to change color this development now I will set the style attribute equal to some Java script if I attempt to set the background color to our color variable well with any CSS properties in JavaScript we need to enclose them within an object so we will use a double set of curly braces and that would work if you're embedding some JavaScript and then you're changing some CSS properties you'll need to enclose those CSS properties within a JavaScript object within this Nesta div element we'll create a paragraph element ment that has text of selected color embed some JavaScript include our stateful color variable after this development I will create a label this label will have text of select a color I'll create an input element input the type attribute is going to be color we'll have an input element for a color the default is black I'll set the value equal to our state full color variable then to change the color I will set the onchange event handler equal to a call back to a function we will handle color change but we still need to to Define this function that's the last step in this component so we will create a function to handle color change there will be one parameter an event all we're going to do is use our Setter function for our color whichever color we select that's going to be its value either RGB hsl or hexadecimal we will access this event Target access its value set the color to whatever that value is so if I set the color to be I don't know blue well that color is going to change to be blue and that is everything we need for this component we haven't applied any CSS yet so it's not very impressive although it does have functionality so be sure to save everything we will go to our CSS stylesheet let's select the body of our document I will set the font family to be aial with a backup of s serif I will take our class of Color Picker container this is what contains everything this div element take our Color Picker container I will use flexbox because I like flexbox display Flex Flex direction will be a column right now it's a row and align items in the center much better let's take our H1 element that would be this heading we are selecting H1 let's add some margin of 50 pixels and increase the font size to 3 r let's select our color display that would be this element right here that has a class of color- display I will set a width of 300 pixels a height of 300 pixels I'll use flex box for all the elements within display Flex justify content in the center then align items Center I'll add a border around this element border 5 pixel solid I'll use hsl for the color let's pick something light gray I'll set the lightness to be 80% then I'll round the corners with border radius border radius 25 pixels I'll add a little bit of margin to the bottom margin bottom 25 pixels so when we select a color it's going to change I'm going to add a transition effect so the transition is a little more smooth I will set the transition property after a quarter of a second 0 2 5 Seconds we will ease this transition so this animation should be more smooth let's select this paragraph element and style it take our color display class access the paragraph element within for the color I'll use hsl values 0 0% then 20% this will make the text a dark gray color although it's kind of small you can't really see it I'll increase the font size to 2 RM then text align Center let's work on the text of the label we're going to select our label increase the font size to 1.5 RM let's set the font weight to be bold and add a little bit of margin to the bottom margin bottom 10 pixels the last thing we need to do is change this input element so it's a little bigger I will select our input element but I don't want to select all input elements I'll use an attribute selector select all input elements that have a type of color so that'll be just this one I will set a width of 75 pixels a height of 50 pixels some padding of 5 pixels I'll set a border radius to round the corners of 10 pixels then set the border to be 3 pixels solid and for the color I'll use hsl zero for the Hue zero for the saturation 80% for the lightness that should give us a thick gray border all right everybody so that is a Color Picker program you can create as an exercise for react yo what's going on everybody so in today's video I got to explain updator functions in react an updator function is a function passed as an argument to set State usually for example I have a Setter function for a year if I need to increment my year by one I would just add plus one to year this does in fact work but a better practice would be to pass in an updator function as an argument usually this is represented as an arrow function by passing in an updater function this allows for safe updates based on the previous state you typically see updator functions used with multiple State updates and asynchronous functions it is a good practice to use updator functions when ever possible so in this basic example I've made a counter program we can increment count decrement count and reset count within each of these functions I'm taking my state variable of count adding + one minus one or set and count to equal zero in the case of reset I don't want to increment once I would like to increment twice I will take set count update the state again using count plus one this is different for me adding two to count I want to increment count by one twice I will set the state of count twice count + one then count plus one if I attempt to run this I will increment count twice with every button click however our count only increases by one during each button click I'm very persistent let's try and set count again because you know the first two times didn't work during each button click I would like to increment count by one three times but we're still only updating by one still here's the reason why we're using the current state of count to calculate the next state after using a Setter function this doesn't trigger an update react batches together updates for performance reasons you would imagine that after these functions we would update but that's not necessarily the case using react we batch together the State updates for performance reasons in reality it's going to look something like this we're taking count which is zero adding one to it count didn't update yet it's still zero add one to it take count which is still zero because we didn't update add one to it in reality what we're doing is setting count to be one three separate times and then updating this would be similar to me hitting the refresh button on my web browser a bunch of times we've sent a bunch of commands to refresh the web browser but we may only end up refreshing once not each time I click the button that's because our web browser has its own event Loop cycle that's a similar way of thinking about it if for some reason you need to use multiple State updates you'll want to use an updator function here's how we're going to write a function our function has one parameter count in this case Arrow then do this let's write an arrow function for each set count so this will work however you'll want to rename count to be something else we're going to be working with the previous state of count not the current state we're using the previous state of count to calculate the next state according to the react documents you'll want to rename count as either something like previous count such as this or you can take the first letter of the state variable in this case C I find taking the first letter of the state variable much more easier to read it's less ver Bose so this will work then when I press the increment button we're updating the state three separate times C represents the previous count not the current count with our updator function we're taking the pending state to calculate the next state not the current state we don't update until later when we pass in an updator function we're adding all of these updator functions to a q a q is a type of data structure a q is similar to a bunch of people waiting in line it's first come first serve the first person in line is going to be helped first so during the next render it will call all of these functions in order rather than batch them all together when using multiple State updates you'll want to be sure to use updator functions it is good practice whenever possible to use updator functions just for consistency even if you're only going to update the state once it would still be good practice to use an updator function it will help future proof your code in case you ever need to update the state again so now let's take our decrement function currently we're updating the current state of count not the previous state let's begin by setting up a parameter of count Arrow then do this but we'll want to be sure to rename count just to show that we're working with the previous state not the current state let's rename count as the first letter of the state variable which is c c arrow take C minus 1 let's do this two additional times now when we increment we will increment 3 separate times and we can decrement three separate times now last we have reset with the setter function we're not dependent on the previous state all we're doing is setting count to be zero if I was going to use an updator function it would look like this C Arrow C equals z we really don't care about the previous state this would still technically work we don't really need our count for anything we're setting c equal to zero because by passing in zero we're already setting it to be zero in this specific example an updator function wouldn't be necessary because we don't need the previous state all right everybody so those are updator functions it's a function passed as an argument to set State usually when updating a state variable you'll pass in an arrow function if we were working with a state variable of year I would pass in an arrow function that looked like this we have a parameter of Y Arrow let's take y + 1 if I was incrementing our year by one in this case by using updator functions they allow for safe updates based on the previous state not the current state this allows for multiple State updates and is used with asynchronous functions it's a good practice to use updator functions whenever possible we will be using updator functions in the future and well everybody those are updator functions in react hey everybody so in today's video I'm going to show you how we can update the state of objects be sure that you're importing the UST State Hook from react so we'll Begin by creating a constant use array D structuring our object will be a state variable of car then we need a Setter variable for this car set car equals the use State hook you can set the initial state with you state so what we're going to do in this lesson is create a JavaScript object we're going to create your favorite car with three properties a year a make who manufactured the car and a model so pick a car that you like I like a 2024 Ford Mustang if you would like although not necessary you can put each of these properties on a new line for readability personally I find that easier to read so car is going to be an object with these three properties but later on we're going to update these properties with a few text boxes within our return statement we will create a development to wrap everything I will create a paragraph with some text your favorite car is so we have that text currently We'll add our cars year followed by The Cars make then the cars model so for me my paragraph States your favorite car is a 2024 Ford Mustang after our paragraph element we're going to create three input elements one for year make and model so let's do that I will create an input element the type of this input element will be number for the year so we should have some arrows on this input element to increment or decrement I will set the initial value to equal the year of our car car doe I'll add a break afterwards let's copy this input element paste it twice the second input element is going to have a type of text for a string the initial value will be the make of our car in my case Ford the third input element will have type text the value will be model I have a 2024 Ford Mustang when I interact with these input elements I would like to change the property of my object we'll need to use the onchange event handler the onchange event handler is going to accept a call back to some functions function handle year change there will be one parameter an event the event object is going to be provided to us through the onchange event handler when we add that in in a moment let's copy this function we'll fill it in later then we will have a function to handle make change then handle model change we have our three functions to change the year the make and the model properties of our object with our input elements we will set the on change event handler equal to a call back a call back to handle year change so let's set the onchange event handler to the other two input elements onchange handle make change onchange handle model change the last thing we got to do is finish filling in our functions we'll begin with handle year change if I want to change the state of my car object I will use the setter function that's provided to us with use State set car set of parenthesis we will be using an updator function but there's something I want to explain first we're going to set our car to be a JavaScript object if I were to take the year and set it equal to 2025 this is what happens if I interact with this input element let's say I decrease this input element well the value changes to 2025 that worked but the make and the model of our car disappeared these properties no longer exist what we've ended up doing is replacing the initial object that has these three properties with a new object that has this one property of year we need some way to retain the make and model of our car the previous properties that we're not updating that's why we're going to precede this property to be changed with the spread operator of our car when we update the state of our car we're going to be creating a new new object spread all of the current properties of our car and add a year after using the spread operator it's going to look like this we'll have a year make model and year again if you have an object with two properties with the same name you'll end up using the later one and disregarding the first JavaScript doesn't allow for duplicate Keys that's why we're going to be using the spread operator on our car object than updating the year that should allow us to retain the previous properties if I were to interact with the year we'll retain the previous properties they won't change currently the setter is only set to change the year to 2025 we're going to access the event object provided to us from the onchange event handler behind the scenes I will change the year to be access our event object access its Target access its value when I interact with this input element the year property is going to change accordingly but a better practice with use state would be to use an updator function which we learned about in the last video we don't want to modify the current state of car but rather make a reference to the previous state this allows for safe updates we're going to turn this object to be part of an arrow function so let's create our Arrow function we will take our car Arrow do this so with an arrow function if you have a set of curly braces after the arrow function JavaScript thinks you're trying to write a multi-line statement but that's not the case we're trying to create a JavaScript object what you could do is surround your set of curly braces with a set of parentheses that will allow you to create an object within an arrow function since we're working with the previous state of car and not the current state we would want to name this to something else one common naming convention is to take the first letter of the state variable and use that to indicate that this is the previous state so c will be our parameter we will use the spread operator on the previous state of car represented as C and that should work this allows for safe updates especially if you're updating the state of your car more than one time within a function see my video on updator functions if you'd like to learn more about that all right then we have to handle make change we will use our setter set car we're going to be replacing the initial object with a new object we will use the spread operator on our car access the make set it equal to access our event parameter that's provided to us access its Target access its value we'll upgrade the statement so that it's an updater function let's take our car Arrow do this then we will rename car as C to indicate that we're working with the previous state of car not the current state I can change my year and I can change the make and that should update we have one last function to work with handle model change again set car we're creating a JavaScript object use the spread operator on our card to spread the properties so we don't lose them update the model with our access our event access its Target access its value then we'll change this to be an updator function we have parameter of car Arrow do this since we're creating a JavaScript object within an arrow function we need to surround it with a set of parentheses and then rename car as C to indicate we're working with the previous state and that should work I will change the year the make and the model all right everybody so that is how we can update the state of an object using react hey what's going on everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can update the state of an array using react all right everybody here's how we can update the state of an array using react be sure to import the UST State Hook from react we'll Begin by creating a constant use array D structuring the name of our array will be Foods because I'm hungry like you ual we'll need a Setter function for the state variable set Foods equals use State we will set the initial state to be an empty array if you would like to include some initial elements you can put that within here such as an apple an orange and a banana we'll create two functions a function to add an element to this array and another function to remove an element we'll create a function to handle add food there are no parameters and we'll declare a function to handle remove food we'll fill these in later within our return statement let's wrap everything within a div element I will create an H2 heading that says list of food we'll create an unordered list with a pair of UL tags within my unordered list we will embed some JavaScript code let's take our array of foods use the built-in map method the map method will return a new array what would we like to do with all of these elements of our array well we're provided with an element which we will name as food and an index these are the parameters that we'll receive automatically we'll write an arrow function to do something I will create a list item element we have three already because our array initially has three elements an apple orange and a banana if I were to go to my console react wants us to add a key for each list item so it can keep track of them so with the opening list item tag I will set the key attribute to equal our index within each list item I I will add the current food element and let's see if this works yes it does Apple orange banana if I were to change the initial values of this array within new state that should be reflected after the unordered list we'll create an input element to enter in the names of some food I will create an input element the type the type will be text because we're adding a string I will set the ID equal to be food input I'll add a placeholder too I will set the placeholder attribute to be enter food name after this input element let's create a button the button will have text of add food with this button I will set the onclick event handler equal to to a call back to handle ad food let's work on the handle ad food function we need to get the value found within this input element if I were to type coconut then press the button I need to get this value but first we'll select this input element to access it I will create a constant of new food new food will be a string it's going to contain this value I will access this element this input element document. get element by ID the ID that I'm getting is food input I would just like the value not the entire element so if I were to type in coconut press the button new food is going to be a string of coconut then after pressing the button I'm going to reset this input element so it clears like this I can do that by copying this line of code where we access the value set it equal to be an empty string so if I were to type in something it should reset after hitting the button which it does let's try a mango and that resets too so we have the string that contains our new food we'll use our Setter to update our array if I were to pass in a new array then add new food this is what happens I will attempt to add a coconut add food our initial values of Apple orange and banana they're all gone we've replaced the initial array with the new one that contains only one string element our new food that we're trying to add we need to copy over the previous elements of this initial state within this new array when setting the state we will use the spread operator and access our array of foods the spread operator when used on an array will spread all of these elements into separate values it'll look something like this we're replacing the initial state of this array with a new one so we need to copy the old elements over so this does work I will attempt to add a coconut and a main go however it would be best practice if we were to use an updator function we don't want to directly work with the current state of a state variable rather the previous state I will will upgrade the statement into an updator function we will take Foods Arrow do this you don't want to use the same name as the current state variable a common naming convention is to take the first letter of your state variable and use that as a parameter foods will become f for the previous state we will use the spread operator on the previous state of foods and that should work we have an apple orange banana we can add a coconut or a Maino now we're going to complete the handle remove food function there's one or two things I need to change make sure we use camel case naming convention I accidentally made the r lowercase there's going to be one parameter an index number because we'll be working with the index numbers of these list item elements within our unordered list we'll be working with the opening list item tag just for readability I'm going to put this on a new line like so within the opening list item tag we will set the onclick event handler equal to a callback a call back to the handle remove food function this function needs a parameter in order for us to pass in a parameter to the handle remove food callback we need to convert this to an arrow function we'll create an arrow with no parameters Arrow do this within the map method we're provided with an index number we'll be passing in that index number to this function so we can work with it within the handle remove food function we will use the setter for our Foods within the setter we'll use the filter method we will take our Foods use the built-in filter method of arrays with the filter method of an array we are provided with an element and an index number for that element however we do have a naming conflict we've already stated that the parameter of this function is going to be index just to differentiate it I'm going to rename index as I so within the filter function we will use an arrow function to do something we're going to filter all elements where the current index represented as I does not equal the index that we receive so if you take a look our element parameter is provided to us but we're not using it you can see that it's kind of grayed out we're going to replace this with an underscore using an underscore for a parameter is a convention to indicate that the parameter being passed to the function is ignored so with parameters if you see an underscore that means ignore it all right and this should work I will add a coconut a mango then I can click on one of these list items to remove it let's remove our banana our Apple and the mango all right everybody so that is how we can update the state of arrays using react hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can update the state of an array of objects if you're able to comprehend this lesson and you've watched previous topics we'll be ready to make a few projects and react so let's get started like we've done in Prior lessons be sure to import the UST State hook in this topic we're not going to create one state variable but four const cars cars is going to be an array of objects then we need a Setter for our array of cars equals use state I'm going to set the initial state to be an empty array then we will create a state variable for the cars year and a Setter for car year use state if we're going to be adding car objects to make it easier for me I could set the initial state to be a year like 2024 something that's kind of recent but I think it would be a lot cooler if we use JavaScript to get the current year right now I'm filming this video in December 2023 for the initial state I'm going to create a new date object then get the full year method for me this is going to turn 2023 but depending on when you're watching this video it might be later we'll create a state variable for our cars make who manufactured the car set car make equals use State I will set the initial state to be an empty string then we need the model I'll just copy this because I'm lazy change make to be model set car model the initial State for the model will be a string all right now we're going to declare all the functions we'll need throughout this application we'll create a function to add a car remove a car change the year change the make change the model five functions total we'll declare a function to handle add car then a function to handle remove car are there is one parameter an index what is the index of the object that we're removing from this array we need a Handler for year make and model function handle year change there is one parameter an event that will be provided to us through the onchange event handler we need a function to handle make change handle make change and handle model change so we should have five functions total add car remove car change the year change the make change the model let's create our HTML elements So within our return statement I will create a div to enclose everything let's create an H2 element for a heading list of car objects afterwards I will create an unordered list we will populate this unordered list later we will create three input elements for the year the make and the model of our car that we're trying to add we will begin with input that has a type of number I will set the value to equal this state of car year and for me that's 2023 that's because I'm creating a date object of the current date and time then returning the year depending on what year you're watching this it might be different I will set the on change event handler equal to a call back to handle year change I'll add a break afterwards okay let's copy this input element including the break the type of the second input element will be text the value will be the cars make who made the car the onchange event handler will be a call back to handle make change we should add a placeholder to tell the user what we want them to type in it's not very apparent I'll put this on a new line for readability I will set the placeholder attribute equal to enter car make let's copy this element paste it for the third input element the value will be car model the onchange event handler will be a call back to handle model change the placeholder will be enter car model then we'll create a button to submit our car object button the text on the button will be add car we will set the on click event handler equal to handle Adar all right now we have to fill in these functions we'll begin with handle year change because it's easy we will use the setter for set car Year we will pass in Access our event object that's provided to us access its Target access its value then we have to do this with make and model set car make access the value of the target of the event pass it as an argument set car model again take our event access its Target access its value so now we should be able to update these values let's try it when I click on the button I would like to add this object to my array of objects within our handle Adar function we have a few things to write it's not as complicated as what you think it might be using these State variables of year making model we will create a new car const new car equals a JavaScript object with these properties the year will equal the current state of car year the make will equal the current state of of car make the model will equal the current state of car model then just for readability I'm going to put all these properties on a new line not necessary but I find it easier to read we will use the setter for our array of car objects we will use an updator function we will take cars Arrow create a new array use the spread operator on cars we need to copy the previous elements over to the new array we don't want to lose them then we will add a new element our new car object so we don't want to use the current state of cars but rather the previous state with this updator function a common naming convention for your parameter is to use the first letter of that state variable let's rename cars as C so what we're going to do now is go to our unordered list we need we need to populate it with list items I will embed some JavaScript take our array of cars use the built-in map method to return a new array we're provided with two arguments an element and an index with the map method but I'm going to rename element as car so it's more understandable what would we like to do I'll use an arrow function we will return a list item element and for readability I'm just going to place these on a new line react wants us to add a key to each list item element so let's take care of that I will set the key of each list item element to be our index that's provided to us within each list item element I will display the cars year followed by The Cars make and the cars model all right let's see if this works let's add a 2023 Ford Mustang and that worked how about a 2024 Chevrolet Corvette and a 2022 Dodge Challenger one thing I'm going to add to the handle Adar function after submitting a car I would like to reset these values at the end of this function let's use the setters I will set the car year when we're done with it to be the current year we'll create a new date object get the F year update the state to whatever value is returned we'll use the setter for the car make and reset it to be an empty string same thing with the car model all right let's see if this resets 2023 Ford Mustang and it does 2025 Chevrolet Camaro and that does reset you can see that my year went back to 2023 even though I adjusted it to 2025 the make and model were both replaced with empty strings now I would like to remove a car when I click on one of these list item elements we'll make one change to the opening list item tag I will set the unclick event handler to a call back to handle remove car we do have to pass in an argument though to this function we have to pass in an index what is the index of the car we're trying to remove if I attempt to pass in an argument we will call this function right away we will convert this call back to an arrow function that has no parameters So within the handle remove car function there's not a lot to write we will use the setter for our cars we'll use an updator function we don't want to use cars but we'll use the first letter to indicate we're working with the previous state arrow take the previous state of our array of cars represented as C use the built-in filter method we will filter any cars that don't meet a certain criteria the filter method provides us with an element and an index but we do have a naming conflict we already have a parameter with the name of index let's rename the index of each element within our array as I then do this with an arrow function we'll write our condition check to see if the index of the current element I is not strictly equal to the index we would like to remove we'll filter out that element when we create a new array so we're not working with the current element even though it's provided to us so what people do as a convention if you have a parameter you're not using people will change the name of that parameter to be an underscore that tells other people to ignore this parameter and that should work let's run and test everything let's add a 2023 forward Mustang but feel free to pick some different cars 2024 shev roll Corvette 2022 Dodge Challenger and I should be able to remove a car when I click on it that list item element our Corvette is gone our Mustang and our challenger all right everybody so that is how to create an array of objects and update their state using react hey everybody in today's video I'm going to walk you through creating a to-do list app using react so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's do this everybody we'll need to create a new jsx file going to our source folder we will rightclick new file this component will be named too list. jsx this will be a function-based component function to do list no parameters then let's be sure to export it because because if I don't do it now I'm going to forget export default to do list we will be using the use State hook we should import that import react use object D structuring I would like just the use State Hook from its location of react we do need to return something for now we're just going to return a fragment going back to our app component we need to import our to-do list component component import to-do list from its relative file path SL too list. jsx we will return one to-do list component and we are ready to move on within our to-do list component we will have two State variables const tasks tasks will be an array of strings we need a Setter function for tasks set tasks equals the use State hook the initial state of tasks is going to be an empty array but eventually we're going to populate this array with strings one string for each task to add and we will create a state variable for a new task new task is whatever we're currently editing with the text box we will be adding our new task to our array of tasks then we need a Setter function for new task set new task equals U State the initial state will be an empty string let's declare the functions we'll need throughout this program we will need a function to handle input change there will be one parameter an event this function is for our text box when we type in something we'll need a function to add a task function add task there will be no parameters function delete task there will be one parameter an index an index of the list item we would like to delete let me scroll down a function to move task up there is one parameter an index what is the index of the list item we would like to move up within our list and a function to move task down we will also accept an index okay and these are the functions we'll need until we fill these in I'm going to close these functions okay now we'll go to our return statement we have a lot of HTML elements to add we'll begin with a div element our div element will have a class name of two do list within this development we'll create an H1 ment for a heading The Heading will be a to do list after this H1 element I'll create another div element within this div element I will create an input element this will be a self-closing tag just for readability I'm going to place each attribute on a new line we have a lot of attributes to write I will set the type of this input element to be text I'm going to zoom in so you can see it more easily I'll add a placeholder of enter a task dot dot dot enter a task I will set the value of this text box to be some JavaScript our new task State variable this one when we type within this input element we will use the onchange event handler equal to a callback to a JavaScript function a callback to handle input change we'll fill in this function since we're here going to handle input change we will use the setter for our new task access our event parameter access its Target access its value so when we type within the text box it should change eat breakfast if we didn't set the new task and we type within the text box we don't see the text it doesn't change that's why we need this function so we can see the text when we write within the input element let's scroll back down to the bottom after our input element we will create a button element with text of add to add a task for the class name of the button we'll set the class name attribute of the button to be add button add- button I will set the onclick event handler equal to a JavaScript call back we will call the function of add task now temporarily until we apply some CSS I'll write a few tasks within our array just temporarily let's say our first task is to eat breakfast take a sh shower and walk the dog after our development we'll create an ordered list with a pair of O tags within this pair of O tags we'll be embedding some JavaScript we have a lot to write we're going to take all of our tasks and use the map method we will create a list item element for each task for each element within this array we'll use the map method we're provided with two parameters the current element and the index of the current element but I'll rename this element parameter as task so it's more easily understandable within the map method we will use an arrow function what would we like to do with each task I'll put this on a new line we will create a list item a list item element So currently we have three list item elements now react wants us to add a key for each element so it can more easily keep track of each element with the opening list item tag I will set the key attribute equal to the current index within the list item element I will create a span element for some text the class name for this span element will be text this will be for the text of each list item element within the span element we will include the current task we have three tasks eat breakfast take a shower walk the dog after our span element we'll create a button element this button element will be for a delete button to delete this task this button will have a class name of delete dasb button I will set the onclick event handler equal to a call back a call back to delete task now we do have to pass in a parameter the index of the list item we would like to delete delete task pass in the urrent index with a call back if you add a set of parentheses right away when we pass in an argument this will call the function right away instead we will use an arrow function to prevent that let's copy this button paste it we'll now create a move up button to move a task up if we need to change the priority the text on the button will be up but you know what I like to use emojis I'll use a pointer finger I think that would be more fun the class name will be move button on click will be set equal to a call back to move task up we'll be passing in the current index make sure that this is an arrow function too let's copy this button again paste it this next button will be for moove task down we can either write down for the text or I'll use an emoji for fun down all right and that is all the HTML that we need before we fill in these functions let's apply some CSS to everything I'm zoomed in to 100% currently let's select the container of to-do list this development so this has a class of to-do list let's change the font family to be aial with a backup of son serif text align Center denter the text and add a little bit of margin to the top of 100 pixels let's select our H1 element in increase the font size to 4 RM then we'll select all buttons increase the font size to 1.7 RM set the font weight to be bold add some padding around each button padding 10 pixels by 20 pixels set the font color to be white we'll add some background color pretty soon remove the border border none border radius to smooth the corners by five pixels change our cursor to be a pointer when we hover over a button that does appear to work we'll add a transition effect when we hover over a button let's change the background color and have it ease after 0.5 5 Seconds let's work on the background color of the buttons next we'll select the class of add button add- button pick a background color I'll pick Green but I will use hsl values I've already pre-picked a color now when I hover my cursor over the add button access the hover sudo class take the lightness make it 10% darker let's do this with the delete button let's copy what we have paste it for the next set change add to delete I'll pick a red color again I've already picked some values and when I hover make the shade 10% darker and the move buttons I'll make the move buttons blue again I've already picked a color not bad it looks like with the transition I forgot to add s for seconds that's better we'll work on the input element next so after our buttons let's select our input element we'll select all input elements that have a type attribute of text I'll increase the font size to 1.6 RM add a little bit of padding 10 pixels add a border two pixel solid pick a color I'll set the lightess to be 80% but lower the alpha to 50% not bad border radius to smooth the corners five pixels and for the font color H let's find something I'll just lower the alpha to 50% here's the text currently I'm happy with that we'll work on the list items we'll begin with our ordered list remove all padding padding zero so that should delete the numbers we will style each list item element increase the font size to 2 RM set the font weight to be bold add some padding of 15 pixels change the background color I'll set the lightness to 97% add some margin to the bottom of each list item of 10 pixels to separate each of them add a border three pixel solid pick a color for the lightness I'll pick 85% and the alpha down to 75% border radius to round the corners 5 pixels for the elements within each list item I'll use flex box display Flex to align everything and align items Center I would like the text to take up as much space as possible so I will select the class of text use flex box set it to One Flex one it's a shortcut for these three CSS properties Flex grow Flex shrink and flex bases this is more advanced Flex box if you set an element to have Flex one you're applying these three properties basically speaking that element should take up as much space as possible and grow and Shrink with the size of the web browser so all these buttons are going to be pushed to the right because the text wants to take up as much space as possible okay now we will select the class of our delete button and move button these two sets of buttons let's add some padding 8 pixels by 12 pixels increase the font size to 1.4 R I'll add some margin to the left of each button margin left 10 pixels much better this is optional but I'm going to change the background color of the body of my document I will select the body change the background color I'll go with a dark gray color I'll set the lightness to 10% I'll also take our H1 element and set the font color to be white I think that looks pretty good but you don't necess neily need to change the background color if you don't want to our CSS is now done we just have to add some functionality let's go back to our to-do list component we'll begin with add task after hitting the add button we'll call this function to add a new task we have to get the text within this text box we'll use the setter for set tasks pass in a new array spread the current elements of tasks and add our new task that state variable we should update this to use an updator function we will use the previous state of tasks represented as T Arrow spread the previous state of tasks represented as T we would like to clear this input element so we can set new task set it to be an empty string to reset it now we should be able to add a new task go to work and add and and that has worked eat lunch now if somebody doesn't type in anything they can still add a task to prevent that with an add task we'll wrap everything within an if statement take our new task use the trim method to remove any white space if after removing any white space if this is still strictly not equal to an empty string then add a new task so now when I try and add an empty task it doesn't do anything let's add some text go to work and that will work the add task function is now done let's work on delete task delete task provides us with an index an index of the element we would like to delete maybe I don't want to take a shower I'm only a little bit stinky So within delete task we will create a new array of updated tasks so we need to use the filter method take our array of tasks use the filter method with the filter method we're provided with an element and each index of that element during each iteration but we have a naming conflict we already have a parameter named index for the index we would like to delete we'll rename index within the filter method as I to differentiate it Arrow then a condition if the current index of I is strictly not equal to the index we would like to delete put it within our new array of updated tasks if these two indexes match we will filter it out we don't want it cuz we want to delete it then once we have our new array of updated tasks it should be missing that element now we're currently not using this element parameter even though it's provided to us a common convention that people do if a parameter should be ignored people will change this to an underscore that's a convention to say ignore this we will set our new tasks with our updated tasks and this is an array an array that's missing one element whichever one we filter out using the filter method now we should be able to delete an element I do not want to take a shower delete and I don't feel like going to work delete delete task is now done now we need need to be able to move a task up or down using the directional buttons so let's work on task up first let's check to see if our index that's passed in as an argument is greater than zero if the element is already at the top we don't need to move it up further we need to create a new array of updated tasks equals spread the current tasks and create a new array of updated tasks to work with now we're going to use array destructuring to swap two elements within an array here's the formula we have the current index and the index minus one we will be swapping these with index minus one and the current index so take our updated tasks at the current index and the updated tasks at index minus one set these equal to updated tasks at index minus one and updated tasks at the current index I do have a separate video on destructuring if you need a refresher this code will swap two elements within an array and then we will set our tasks using the setter function set tasks pass in our updated array and now we should be able to move an element up whoops looks like we have two functions for move task up move task down all right let's see if this works and now we should be able to move these up with move task down we're going to copy everything within move task up the condition is if our index is less than our task length property minus one if our element is already at the bottom we don't want to move down any further take index + one and then update our tasks now we should be able to move tasks up and down and even add new tasks and delete tasks and of course to initially have no elements within this array we can delete all these so then we start with an empty array all right everybody so that is a somewhat extensive program to create a to-do list applic using react hey everybody we have an important topic to discuss today and that is the use effect react hook use effect is a react hook basically speaking use effect tells react to do some code when then pick one of the following do some code when this component rerenders or do this code when the component mounts when you mount a component that's when you create and append it to the Dum that is known as mounting or do some code when the state of a value changes think of an effect as some side code you would like to perform I don't really think use effect is a great name if I could rename use effect I feel like a more appropriate name would be use side code but that's just my opinion so think of an effect SM side code you'll write your side code within a function this can be a callback an anonymous function or an arrow function and optionally for the second argument you can pass in an array of dependencies if we would like to run our side effect on every render of the component we would just need to pass in a function such as an arrow function do this code every time the component renders if you would like to perform some side code only when the component mounts and not during every render you would pass in an empty array of dependencies that tells react perform this code only once when the component mounts within your array of dependencies if you were to pass in a value this code would run when the component mounts plus when this value changes use effect has a bunch of different uses you'll see use effect with event listeners do manipulation subscriptions to real-time updates fetching data from an API and clean up when a component unmounts unmounting is when you remove a component from the DOT whereas in mounting is adding a component to the Dom okay let me give you a few examples in order for us to use use effect we have to import it from the react Library we have use State as well as use effect in this example we're going to create a count State variable const count and a Setter for count set count equals use State the initial state of count will be be zero and we'll display our count within our return statement let's create one paragraph element that has text of count as well as our state variable of count and a button let's create a button element that has text of add when we click on ADD we will add one to our count we'll need a function to work with I will set the onclick event handler equal to a JavaScript function let's name this function add count then we just need to declare this function function add count all we'll do is use our Setter for count take the previous state of count as a parameter Arrow do this take the previous state of count add one every time I press the button we will add one one to count now let's use use effect I can run some side code every time this component renders I would just have to place that code within a function that will pass to use effect every time this component renders I will change the title of the document we'll need to use use effect be sure to place use effect near the top of your component we will call use effect there are two arguments a function and an array of dependencies I would like to perform some code every time the component renders I do not need that second argument now we just need a function this can be a callback an anonymous function or an arrow function we're going to be using an arrow function every time this component rerenders what would we like to do let's access our document access the title set it equal to be a template string of count and insert our state variable of count Let me refresh every time this component rerenders including initially when we Mount the component we will perform this code where we update the title every time I press the added button the title is going to update if you would like your side code to run only when the component it mounts when we create and add it to the Dom initially you'll pass in as a second argument an empty array an empty array of dependencies so if I were to run this again and press add well our title only updates once and no other time after that for example I might want to set my title to be my counter program I only need to update this title once I I don't need to update it every time the component renders it's a oneandone effect in this case I would like to add an empty Ray of dependencies because if I didn't well we would update this title every time the component renders when we really don't need to in this specific example it doesn't benefit us to update the title every time we add one to count let's revert those changes back you could pass in a value to your array of dependencies within your array of dependencies you can add a value let's add our count State variable what we're telling react is that when our component mounts plus when this value changes of count then do the side code so with what I've written currently every time I press the button the title is going to update if our count State variable updates perform our side code this is very s similar to us not having that dependency array you know this will work too however since we don't have any dependencies this code is going to run for any reason that this component rerenders even for something completely unrelated by adding an array of dependencies and placing a value within do this code only when this value updates now to demonstrate we'll create another button to subtract the text will be subtract we'll create a function to subtract count we can copy this function paste it change the name to subtract count take the previous state of count minus one so if our count changes whether we add one or minus one the title of our document is still going to change if the value of count changes for any reason do the side code let's add another value to our dependency array we will create a state variable for color color and set color equals use State the initial state for my color will be green we'll flip between green and red green means go red means stop after our subtract button I will add a break and button two change the color change color the onclick event handler will equal this function of change color and we just need to Define this function function change color we will use the setter for set color we will use the previous state of color is the previous state of color strictly equal to Green tary operator is this true if it is return Red otherwise return green then we will take our paragraph of count access the style attribute set it equal to embed some JavaScript we need a JavaScript object so we need another set of curly braces take the color property set it equal to our color State variable so now the count is green with our title let's also add the color so I'm not going to add our color to our dependency array quite yet we can add the title updates we can subtract the title still updates but if we change the color the color changes of this paragraph element but not the title we're executing this code only when the count changes so even though I'm flipping between red and green the title is still staying the same if I were to add our color to our dependency array anytime the count or the color changes update the title so let's try this again the title updates when I add or subtract or change the color now the title is count one red count one green count one red count one green so that's where your dependency array comes in anytime one of these values change perform the side code now you may have noticed if you remove use effect well your title is still going to update so why would you need use effect there are a couple benefits of using use effect the first benefit is that by using use effect it keeps your code more organized if you were to look over some react code and look within the use effect hook you could tell when exactly this code runs does it run during every render only when the component mounts or when one of these values change if you didn't use use effect well then this code would run every single time regardless every time the component rerenders which you may not always want but not only that but with more advanced features such as event listeners or subscriptions you may want to remove or free up those resources you can return a cleanup function if you were to return a function when this component unmounts when we remove it from the Dom or before the next render you can perform some cleanup code for example if we were to add an event listener when the component mounts we would like to remove it before unmounting if we don't it may lead to unexpected Behavior so that's another benefit of using use effect perform some code only in certain situations and you do have the option to do some cleanup code before the next reender or when you unmount the component I'll discuss the return statement in this next demonstration and how it can be useful in this next example we're going to create a width and a height what the width and the height of our window is every time we adjust the size of the window the width and the height displayed is going to change we'll need two State variables to work with a width set width we will be using use state so the initial state of the width of the window access our window give me the inner width property then let's do this with height const height set height window do inner height within our return statement we will create a paragraph element that has text of window width we will display our width State variable then add pixels for a unit of measurement then let's do this with height window height display our height State variable so we have window width and window height if I were to adjust this window nothing happens there's no change let's create a function to handle size function handle resize no parameters we're going to set our width to be the inner width property of our window and set height H should be Capital set height take our inner height of our window and reset it so now we need to add a an event listener because this still doesn't change we're going to add an event listener that will listen for a resize event whenever we resize our window if we attempt to use this without use effect but within the body of our component we will take our window add an event listener we need an event and a function to do something the event is going to be a resize event when the window is resized perform this code we will pass in a call back to handle resize and then for demonstration purposes I'm going to console.log event listener added we only need one event listener to make this program work now if I were to resize my window this does work our width State variable changes same thing goes with the height now let's take a look at our console there's an issue we only need one event listener to make this program work however every time the component rerenders we're adding a new event listener we have added over 1,000 event listeners that's really not good how about this only when our component mounts when we append it to the Dom we will add one event listener and that's it so guess what we're going to place our code within use effect we will pass in a function and an array of dependencies when would we like to add an event listener let's add an event listener only when the component mounts so we need to add an empty array of dependencies let's try that again I'm going to resize our window that should be good go to inspect yeah you can ignore all this garbage so if you have strict mode on which I do use effect is going to run twice it will run a development only setup and then a cleanup cycle so this is normal so we didn't add thousands of event listeners besides the first cleanup cycle because I have strict mode on we're only adding one event listener because that's all we need we don't need thousands of event listeners if you ever need to unmount the component meaning remove it from the Dom use effect has another use and that is adding a return statement to do any cleanup you will return a function do this code either before the next render or when the component unmounts if we add an event listener then we unmount the component it would be good practice to remove that same event listener if you don't that can lead to unexpected behavior when and we unmount our component we will take our window then remove event listener we will remove the event of resize and a call back to handle resize when we are done with this component free up any resources so that it doesn't lead to unexpected Behavior let me add one more line of code too let's console.log event listener removed let's refresh resize our window a few times go to inspect console okay let's take a look since I am in strict mode we'll run our use once during the development cycle and then clean it up right away then we will add that event listener only once we didn't unmount this component yet so we didn't remove it so by adding a return statement you can do any cleanup either before the next reender or when you unmount the component within a component you can add more than one use effect hook we're going to add a second use effect hook if the width or the height changes we're going to update the title of our document to display the width and the height so let's add a another use effect hook use effect what code would we'd like to perform let's access our document take the title set it equal to be let's use a template string let's say size placeholder width x height when would we like to use this effect let's use this effect when the width and the height update we will need that dependency array we will list the width and the height State variables so on Mount we'll get the size right away 227 by 396 now every time the width and the height changes the title is going to update so you can have more than one use effect hook within your component all right everybody so that is the use effect hook it's a react hook that tells react to do this code when either the component renders this component mounts or the state of a value changes there are two arguments a function that contains the code you would like to perform and optionally an array of dependencies based on what you pass in to use effect you'll either run this code after every render run only when the component mounts or run when the component initially mounts plus when the value changes use effect is great with event listeners Dom manipulation subscriptions to real-time updates fetching data from an API or cleanup when a component unmounts we will have more practice with use effect in the next video where we will create a digital clock and well everybody that is an introduction to use effect in react hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can create a digital clock using react so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay let's get started everybody if you would like a background image for your app place that image within your assets folder here's the image that I'm going to use I found it online we will create a digital clock component within our source folder digital clock. jsx we will need to import two hooks import from react use object destructuring to get the use State hook as well as the use effect Hook from its location of react we're going to create a function based component of digital clock no parameters then be sure to export it at the end export default defaulty default digital clock we do need to return something for the time being we are going to return a fragment just so that everything runs back within our app component we need to import our digital clock component from its locationd digital clock. jsx we will include one digital clock component within our digital clock comp component we'll create the following HTML we will create a div element to contain everything this outer div element is going to have a class name of clock container within this development we will create a nested development this development will have a class name of clock we have a clock within a clock contain container within this in div element we will create a span element to display a time until we get the time working let's display a bunch of zeros for the hours minutes and seconds and here's our time but it's a little small I'm zoomed in currently okay let's go to our CSS stylesheet we will select the following the body of our document our clock container class and our class of clock if you would like to add a background image here's what you can do within the body of your document we will set the background image property to be we will use the URL function within this function we will pass in a relative or absolute file path to your image from the index file we'll have to access the assets folder asset that's the name of the image my image is named background and this is a JPEG okay here's my image but it's a little big then we will take our background position property set it to be Center to Center the image now it does repeat we'll set the background repeat property to be no repeat we'll set the background size to cover to cover this div element the outer div element background size cover now we'll take the background attachment property set it to be fixed as we adjust the size of the window the image is going to adjust accordingly and maintain its aspect ratio we do have a little bit of margin around the body of our document I'm going to remove that margin zero next we have to work on the clock itself it's a little small within the clock class I will set a color of white I'll increase the font size CU we can barely see it to 6 RM that should be a decent size and a font weight of bold pick a font family I will pick monospace I think that'll look good for a clock I will also add a text Shadow effect with a horizontal and vertical offset of three pixels each and a blur of five pixels pick a color I'll pick black but I'll lower the alpha to 75% or so then I will Center align my text text align Center our clock is centered horizontally but not vertically within the window if you would like the clock in the exact middle of the window here are some following optional CSS properties you can add these are optional we'll use flex box display Flex to display all the elements justify content Center to Center this clock vertically within the middle of our window we have to set the maximum height of the body to be 100% of the viewport height we'll add this following property set the minimum height of the body to be 100 VH for the viewport height 100% of the viewport height then use the Align items property set it to be Center to vertically align it and I think that looks pretty good now we'll select our clock container for the background of the clock container I would like it so it looks like we're looking through glass here's how to do that we will use the backdrop filter property use a function of blur pass in a number in an amount of pixels the greater the number the greater the blur here's five pixels here's 50 what's 500 look like okay let's go with five pixels we have a little bit of a blur effect if you would like the clock container to take up 100% of the viewport width you can add the following property set the width of the clock container to be 100 VW for viewport width so now the clock container takes up 100% of the width of the window then I'll add a little bit of padding to the top and bottom but not the sides padding 10 pixels for the top and bottom zero for the sides we should get a little bit of padding on the top and bottom I like that I think that looks pretty good okay we can save everything we no longer need our CSS stylesheet and now we will be working within the digital clock component we'll be using the uate hook we will create a state variable of time const time and a Setter for time named set time equals the use State hook for the initial state of the use State hook we will pass in a new date object whatever the current date and time currently is that's what the initial state of time is going to be it will be an object we will also use the use effect hook we can perform some code during each render or when we Mount or anytime some sort of value updates when this component mounts we'll start an interval to move the clock forward there's two parameters within use effect a function to do something and an array of dependencies for our function we'll use an arrow function parameters Arrow do this and for our dependencies based on the last video we're just going to set an empty array I would like to start a timer only when when we Mount the component we don't need to start a new timer every time the component renders what would we like to do once when our component mounts we will create a constant of interval ID equals set interval with set interval we can pass in a call back and a time in milliseconds to repeat this call back let's do some code every 1,000 milliseconds meaning every 1 second let's do the following we'll write an arrow function to do this every 1,000 milliseconds we will update the state of time using our Setter of set time we will pass in a new date object and that's all we need so after every second we will update the state of time with the new current date and time now if we do unmount this component it would be good practice if we were to clear our timer if we don't it may lead to unexpected Behavior we will add a cleanup function when this component unmounts we will return the following do this function we will call the function to clear interval and pass in that interval ID to stop this interval if we ever unmount our digital clock we don't want it to continue running we want to free up any resources if we don't that may lead to unexpected Behavior so that is all we need with use effect when we Mount and that's it create an interval that updates once every second when we unmount the component clear that interval and that's it now we will also need a function to format time function format time there are no parameters we need to get the hours minutes and seconds of our time the state variable of time that's pretty simple though we will declare using let let hours equals our time State variable use the method of get hours let's do this with minutes let minutes actually let's declare this as const const minutes time. getet minutes and seconds const seconds equals time.get seconds we will also find what the meridium is is it am or p.m we'll have to write the following const meridium equals let's examine our hours is our hours greater than or equal to 12 our time in hours is going to be in military time I believe that's 0 through 23 technically if ours is greater than or equal to 12 tary operator if this is true meridium will be PM otherwise meridium will be am with hours we're going to reassign it let's say that it is 1 p.m. so hours will be 13 1 hour after 12 if I don't want to display my time and military time I'm going to reassign hours we'll take hours modulus 12 modulus gives you the remainder of any division for example if ours is 13 13 modulus 12 has a remainder of 1 so that's how you can convert from military time use modulus 12 what if ours is 12 12 modulus 12 is 0o if it's 12:00 we don't want to display zero we can add the following use the or logical oper operator or return 12 if this equation is zero that is equivalent to false so using the or logical operator ours would instead equal 12 then within format time we're going to return one long template string we will display a placeholder with ours colon a placeholder with minutes colon a placeholder with seconds space placeholder our meridium then within our span element we will display embed some JavaScript called The Format time function here's the current time for me it is 7:52 at night p.m. and the time is updating now we have a problem if one of our units of time is a single digit we don't have any leading Zer so let's fix that we will declare a function function pad zero there's one parameter we have to pass in a number with hours minutes and seconds we will pass each of these units of time to the pad zero function so we will enclose each of these within the pad zero function then return a result so let's pad our hours with zero pad our minutes with zero and Pad seconds with zero okay we have undefined undefined undefined that's okay so within pad zero we have to return something we need to check to see if our number is a single digit we can do that with checking to see if number is less than 10 if it is it's a single digit we'll use the tary operator is our number a single digit is it less than 10 if that's true we're going to return a string of zero if not we don't have to do anything we'll return an empty string we will take all of this and close it within a set of parentheses return either zero or an empty string plus the original number for example if our number was 1 1 is less than 10 that is true we'll return a string of zero the new string concatenation and add our original number of one so we would return 01 if our number was 12 well this condition is false we would return an empty string plus the original number of 12 which would give me a string of 12 so here's the result we have each unit of time with the leading zero if it needs it and we have success F created a digital clock component and the cool thing about doing this in react is that we can reuse this component whenever we want we can create one digital clock component or another or another or another and Let me refresh these to synchronize them these are all individual components running their own code all right everybody so that is how to create a digital clock component using react hey everybody today I got to explain use context in react use context is a react hook it allows you to share values between multiple levels of components without passing props through each level what we'll do in this example is create four components components a through D each component will be nested within one another so within our source folder let's create a new file for component a this will be a jsx file we will create a function based component named component a no parameters for now and be sure to export it export default component a within this component we will return some HTML we will return a div element the div element will have a class name of box within the div element we will create an H1 element that as text of component a within our app component we will import component a import component a from its location component a. jsx we will return a single component a component we're also going to add a little bit of CSS to visualize it we will select our class of box add a border of three pixel solid and padding of 25 pixels here's component a we're going to copy this file of component a and paste it three times we will rename the second copy as component B the third as component C the fourth as component D we have component a b c and d within component B rename any instance of component a with component B the same goes for C and D from component a we're going to import component B import component B from its location component b. jsx after our H1 element we will include one component B component we have component B within component a now within component B we will import component C import component C from its location component c. jsx after our H1 element we will include one component C component so we have component C within component B within component a within component C we will import component D import component D from its location component d. jsx after our H1 element we will include one component D component we have component D within component C within component B within component a I've organized my tabs a b c d within component a we're going to create a state variable const user and a Setter for user equals the U State hook we will need to import it type in your username I'll type in bro code for mine at the top we need to import from react use object destructuring to get the use State Hook from its location of react now after our H1 element I will create an H2 heading we will embed some JavaScript we'll display a template string of hello add a placeholder your username So within component a you should have an H2 heading that displays hello and your username within component D what if I would also like to display my username well from component a I would have to pass props down all the way to component D I'll have to pass them to B which will pass them to C which will pass them to D so if we were using props this is what we would have to do within component B we will pass in props set user to equal our user within component B we'll have to set up props props will be the parameter within component C we will set user to equal embed some JavaScript props do user within component C we'll set up props again within component D we will set user to equal embed some Java JavaScript props do user then within component D set up props again after our H1 element let's create an H2 element we'll embed some JavaScript use a template string display by add a placeholder access props our parameter access the user within component a we have hello your username within component D we have by your username by passing props down each of these nested components this is known as prop drilling where drilling down to the center the center component passing props down this long chain can become very tedious but there's a better solution and that is with the use context hook the use context hook allows us to share values between multiple levels of components without passing props down through each level however we have to set up a provider component which component has the data we would like access to in this case it would be component a in component a we have that state variable of our username which we named user So within our provider component we have three steps we have to import create context from react So within component a we already have used state but we also need create context we need to create some context and Export it export const then we need a unique name for this context we're working with the username let's name our context user context the context name should be descriptive of what you're working with if the data we're working with as a color we could say color context equals create context and this is a function now the last thing we need to do is wrap any children components with within this special provider component we are going to wrap component B within another component we will take our user context access provider set the value equal to be some JavaScript our value of user and we just need to wrap this component of component B component a is now the provider component it's going to provide a value of user we no longer need props we can get rid of these for each component after I deleted props from component B well our username is now undefined within component D we broke that chain all right any component that needs this data we will set up to be a consumer component you can have more than one we'll have to import the use context Hook from react as well as the context that we set up we're exporting it so we need to import it elsewhere within component D we will import from react use object destructuring the use context Hook from its location of react we also need the user context import use object D structuring to get user context from its location of component a that was the original location where we exported it from we'll use the context get the context and store the value we'll do that inside of our component const user equals use context hook we're going to pass in our user context as an argument and now we have access to user we'll use a placeholder and add our user and that has appeared to work we have displayed bu your username we have avoided prop drilling instead of drilling down to the center component to pass down a value by using use context we Traverse up the component tree to find the nearest provider which would be component a component a is the provider component component D is a consumer component and you can have more than one so let's do the same thing with component C we need these two lines of code really we can just copy them because I'm lazy and we need to create a constant of user or some other descriptive name for this value use context pass in our context of user context let's add another H2 element we'll embed some JavaScript use a template string let's say hello again add a placeholder our username So within component C we have used use context again without prop drilling we're just playing hello again your username any component that's a child component of our provider component of a has access to this value that we set up all right everybody so that is the use context react hook it allows you to share values between multiple levels of components without passing props through each level if you have a lot of nested components passing props down to each level can become very tedious this is a way to avoid that and well every everybody that is the use context hook in react okay let's do this everybody we got to talk about the use ref hook in react use ref meaning use reference is very similar to use State use state store some sort of value or an object or an array whenever the state value changes use State renders the component which isn't always what we want use ref meaning use reference it does cause reenders when its value changes use use ref when you want the component to remember some information but you don't want that information to trigger new renders use ref is helpful with accessing and interacting with dom elements handling Focus animations and transitions as well as managing timers and intervals use State triggers renders use ref doesn't in order for us to use the US ref hook we have to import it from react import use ref for this sample program we'll be using UST State originally then we'll switch it up and use use ref to see the differences we'll Begin by using the use State hook we will have a state variable of number and a Setter for number equals U State I will set the initial state of number to be zero we will return a button element the button will have text of Click me I will set the onclick event handler equal to a function of handle click then we just need to declare this function function handle click no parameters what do we want to do when we click on the button let's use the setter for number and increment the previous state of number by one n + one whenever my number updates it's going to cause my component to render I can demonstrate that with the use effect hook so before our function of handle click let's use use effect with use effect if we don't pass in a dependency array we'll perform some code every time this component renders so for this demonstration let's console.log component rendered anytime this component renders using effect is going to execute this code where we display component rendered so I'm going to go to my console when your component mounts you'll render your component twice that's if you're in strict mode just temporarily for this demonstration I am going to remove strict mode so our component renders once on Mount whenever we update the state of a state variable that causes the component to reender that's where use ref comes in use ref doesn't cause a component to render when its value changes it's kind of like an escape hatch so instead of using a state variable we're going to use ref use ref means use reference we're referring to something we will declare a const of ref equals use ref function use ref returns an object an object that has one property of current if you pass in a value to use ref you can set the property of current to some value I will set the current property of my ref object to be zero then within handle click within handle click I will access my ref object access the current property then I'll have access to that value I will set the current property of ref to be ref. current property plus one or we could use the increment operator every every time we click the button we will increase the current property of ref by one and then I will display what that value is console.log access our ref object access the current property let's go to inspect console our component rendered once every time I click the button our component isn't rendering we've only rendered it once the value stored within the current property of my ref object isn't increasing each time I click the button without the component rendering use ref returns an object an object that has one property a property of current let me show you what would happen if I were to console.log ref my reference so here's ref it's an object it's an object with one property when we create this reference the initial value is going to be the initial value we pass in to use ref zero but if I were to change this let's say that the initial value is pizza ref is an object an object with one property of current the value stored within my current property is a string of pizza so what we'll do in this next demonstration is create an input element but we do need to wrap all this HTML within a single element because we can only return a single element at a time normally so we will enclose all of our HTML within a div so we have a button and an input element the current property of your ref object can also refer to an HTML element and that's where use ref is really helpful your reference should be descriptive of what you're referencing we will reference this input element I will name this reference as input ref I will set the initial value value to be null meaning no value within that HTML element we have to set the ref attribute equal to that reference of input ref the ref attribute of an HTML element it's a special attribute used to create references to elements after our component renders I'm going to console.log input ref we'll take a look at what it contains so here's our input ref object it's an object the property of current is set equal to this input element and this input element is one gigantic HTML object if we make any changes to this HTML element it's not going to cause this component to reender and to even check that I have console.log component rendered within use effect if this component renders we'll console.log this message so what would we like to do when we click the button let's take our object of input ref access the current property that will give me my HTML element my input element I will use the built-in Focus method to give this element Focus if I were to click on this button our input element is going to have focus and it doesn't cause the component to render just to check that let's go to inspect console our component rendered once when we initially mounted it every time I click the button the component isn't rendering which is good we don't necessarily need the component to reender every single time not only that let's change the background color of our text box we can really do anything we want with this HTML element without causing the component to reender Let's access our input ref object access the current property that will give me this HTML element let's access the style property access the background color and set it to be yellow now when I click the button we have focus and the background color changes of this input element let's create a few more HTML elements let's copy this button and this input element paste it twice we'll have clickme one click me2 click me3 we'll have to create a few more references let's copy our current reference paste it twice input ref 1 input ref two input ref three the ref attribute of each input element will be input ref one then input ref two input ref three we'll create two more handle click functions just to keep it simple handle click one handle click two handle click three handle click one handle Click 2 handle click three so we need input ref one input ref two input ref three when we click on one of these buttons the background color is going to change as well as the input element having focus when we click on one of these buttons I need the background color of the other input elements to reset back to normal so really we can just copy what we have for the background color but access input ref two and three set the background color to be an empty string for the default if I were to click on button one input ref one is now yellow when I click on button two the background color is yellow input element 1 and three now use the default color and the same thing goes with input element three if I were again to go to inspect console well our component still only rendered once by interacting with these buttons it doesn't cause the component to reender that's because we're using use ref and not use State you don't need to write all this but I changed my program around so it's using use State rather than use ref every time I click one of these buttons now since we're using use State the component rerun ERS by avoiding rendering when it's not needed it's going to make your component more efficient all right everybody so that is used ref use State renders the component when the state value changes use ref means use reference we're storing a reference to something when you use use ref it returns an object an object with one property of current that current property can store a value an array an object or an HTML element when the stored value changes it doesn't cause the component to render this is helpful with accessing and interacting with dom elements handling Focus animations and transitions as well as managing timers and intervals we'll be working with us ref in the next video where we will be making a stopwatch component and well everybody that is the US ref hook in react what's up everybody in today's video we're going to create a working stopwatch using us react so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay let's get started within our source folder we're going to create a stopwatch component stopwatch and this is going to be a jsx file we will be working with function based components function stopwatch no parameters then be sure to export it export default stopwatch in this program we'll need three different hooks let's import them import from react use object destructuring we'll need the use State hook use effect as well as use ref from its location of react we do need to return something for the time being we're going to return a fragment okay let's import our stopwatch from our app component we will import stopwatch from its location slash of stopwatch jsx we will return a single stopwatch component and that is all we need for the app component within our stopwatch component we'll make a few declarations we'll be using the use State hook as well as the use ref hook we'll need to check to see if our stopwatch is currently running we will use use state const is running and a Setter for or is running equals use State I will set the initial state of is running to be a Boolean of false our stopwatch is not currently running we'll also need to keep track of how much time has he elapsed that will also be a state variable const elapsed time and a Setter for elapsed time again we're going to use you state I will set the initial state of our elapsed time to be zero for 0 milliseconds we'll be working with intervals if we start an interval we need to clear it if we're not using it we will use ref to create a constant of interval ID ref equals use ref we will set the initial value of current to be null when we start our stopwatch we'll have to get the current time we'll store that as a reference using use ref const start time ref equals use ref I will set the initial value to be zero our start time will be 0 milliseconds a few things we'll need we'll need to use the use effect hook we will pass in a function and a dependency array the dependency array is going to have one state variable of is running basically speaking when we Mount our component and if is running ever changes we'll perform some side code whatever is within use effect this is where we'll start our interval to move time forward we'll get back to that later we will create a function to start to start or stopwatch a function to stop a function to reset and a function to format time format time within our return statement let's return all the HTML we'll need for this program I will create a div element to act as a container this div element will have a class name of stopwatch within this div element we will create a nested div element that has a class name of display to display the time when we display the time we will embed some JavaScript and call the format time function within our format time function just so we can display something I'm going to return a template string that displays a bunch of zeros really I'm just using this as a placeholder so we are returning a string of a bunch of zeros we'll have three buttons these three buttons will be within another develop vment this development will have a class name of controls we will create a button that has text of start to start the stopwatch this button will have a class name of start- button with this button we will set the onclick event handler to be a JavaScript function we will pass in call back to the start function to start the stopwatch then we need a button for stop let's copy this button paste it change any instance of start to stop onclick will be a call back to stop the class name will be stop- button the text will be sto then we need to reset button let's copy our button paste it change any instance of stop to reset we will pass in a call back to the reset function the class name will be reset dasb button and the text will be reset and that is all the HTML that we need go to our CSS stylesheet now we'll apply some CSS within the body of our document we'll use flex box to display each component display Flex I will set the flex direction to be a column there's not really be any apparent changes until we add more components then I will align items in the center and set the background color to be light gray but I'll use hsl values I will set the lightness to be 95% okay let's zoom out then I will select the class of stopwatch this class contains our stopwatch everything within it I will again use flex box and really I'll just copy these three properties from the body so display Flex Flex Direction column align item Center I will add a border a 5 pixel solid border radius to smooth the corners a 50 pixels set the background color to be white then add some padding of 30 pixels all right let's work on our display next the text is pretty small we will select the class of display increase the font size to 5 RM set the font family to be monospace or some other font that you like let me Zoom back out I will set the font weight to be bold I'll change the color pick a color for the font color I will set the lightness to be 30% I'll add a text Shadow effect text Shadow 2 pixels by two pixels for the vertical and horizontal offset and a blur radius of two pixels and pick a color I'm just going to lower the Al to 75% just so it's more transparent then add a little bit of margin to the bottom margin bottom 25 pixels okay and that is what we need for our display let's work on our buttons next So within our div element of controls I would like to select all button elements within this class select our class of controls select any buttons within our controls class let's set the font size to be 1.5 RM set the font weight to be bold add some padding of 10 pixels by 20 pixels surround each button with some margin 5 pixels I will set a minimum width of each button to be 125 pixels remove the border with border none use border radius to round the corners 10 pixels when we hover our cursor over a button let's change our cursor to be a pointer and that does work I will set the color the font color to be white we'll change the background color pretty soon we'll also add a transition effect let's select the background color and use use an ease transition after 0.5 seconds we will ease let's select our class of start button class start dash button pick a background color I'll pick something green meaning go cuz we're starting our stopwatch background color green but I'll use hsl values cuz I think they look better I've already pre-picked a color I will select these values for the Hue 115 for the saturation 100% for the lightness 40% let's also access the hover sudo class let's copy and paste our start button access the hover sudo class when we hover our cursor over the button what do we want to do let's take the lightness and subtract 5% 5% from whatever it currently owes I'll set mine to be 35% so the color should get a little bit darker when you hover your cursor over the button let's do this with with our stop button we'll copy and paste what we have for our start button change start to stop I'll make the background color red but I'll select something specific for the Stop button I'll set the Hue to be 10 the saturation to be 90 90% And for the lightness 50% let's copy and paste this background color within the hover sudo class set the lightness to be 5 % darker and that does work now for the reset button let's make it blue change stop to reset and pick a blue color for the Hue I'll select 205 90% for the saturation for the lightness 60% when we hover our cursor over the reset button I will set the lightness to be 5% darker so 55% and that looks pretty good and we can close out of our CSS Styles sheet let's go back to our stopwatch component let's work on the start stop and reset functions when we press the start button we will call this function of start so to start the stopwatch we're going to use the setter for is running and set that to be true we will set the state of is running to be true once we press the start button we want this program to be running we also need to set the start time reference updating a reference doesn't cause our component to render if a state changes it does cause the component to render we're going to set the start time reference this is an object we will access the current property and set it equal to now we need to calculate what the start time is so if we were to get the date right now this is is going to return the current date and time in milliseconds minus the elapse time which is initially zero so just to show you what this looks like I'm going to console.log the current property of my start time reference object if I was to start or stopwatch we be given the current date and time in millisecs since epic think of Epic as when your computer thinks time began it's usually a dat around the year 1970 1.7 trillion milliseconds has passed since epic if I were to start the stopwatch again you can see that this number increased slightly we're converting the current date and time into milliseconds by keeping a reference to when we started the stopwatch we can see how many milliseconds has elapsed since then that's kind of the general idea we can get rid of console.log we don't necessarily need it keep it if you would like to stop the stopwatch we're going to set our Boolean of is running to be false that's all we need to do now for reset we're going to set the elapse time to be zero because we would like to reset everything set the state of elapse time to be zero and we will also set is running to be false set is running false if you would like to stop the stopwatch when you reset set is running to be false then since we have a dependency array when we Mount this component and anytime the state of is running changes we'll perform some side code I think what we'll do first is check to see if is running is true if is running if our stopwatch is now running we'll need to create an interval to move time forward we will use the set interval function this has two arguments a call back to a function and a Time in milliseconds to repeat this interval let's say after every 10 milliseconds we'll perform some code I'll use an arrow function after every 10 milliseconds we will set our elapse time to be a new state we will get the date right now minus whatever our start time was we can use our reference start time ref access the current property remember that was milliseconds so get the time right now subtract what our start time was and that will give us our elapse time because we're using the setter for elapse time in order to clear this interval we'll need to keep track of it by its unique ID the set interval function returns that ID we will take our reference of interval ID ref it is an object we will access its current property and set it equal to that reference we should add a cleanup function to the end of our use effect hook we will return a function a cleanup function when is running changes or we unmount our component what would we like to do we need to stop the interval from continuing if we don't it may lead to unexpected Behavior we will use the clear interval function and pass in that unique ID access the current property of our interval ID reference and clear it that will allow us to clear this interval so our program stops running now we just need to fill in the format time function we have a lapse time it's going to be in milliseconds we need to convert it to hours minutes seconds and milliseconds we'll start with hours let hours equals take our elapse time now to convert milliseconds to hours you can follow this formula take our elapse time which is in milliseconds divided by there's 1,000 milliseconds in a second time 60 seconds in a minute time 60 minutes in an hour and close this equation with the floor method of math math. floor okay let's calculate minutes let's change hours to minutes what we got to do is take 1,00 * 60 modulus 60 mod modulus gives you the remainder of any division once our minutes unit hits 60 we need to reset it back to zero that's why we're adding modulus 60 we don't want it to continue to 60 or something above 60 then we have seconds let seconds equals elapse time divid 1,00 modulus 60 and milliseconds let milliseconds equals our lapse time modulus 1000 if you don't want to display all four digits of milliseconds we can divide this by 10 to display only the first two digits we will return a template string we will display the hours colon placeholder minutes colon placeholder seconds colon placeholder milliseconds now if you don't want to display hours you can remove that I'll only display minutes seconds and milliseconds so here's what's going on currently let me stop it so we can start we can stop and we can reset however I would like to format the time I would like to display a leading zero well we can use the pad start method of strings so let's take ours equals we'll use typ casting to convert ours to a string then follow this with pad start method pad this number with two zero characters let's do this with minutes minutes equals convert minutes to a string and then pad it with two zeros seconds and milliseconds all right let's see if this works we can start we can stop we can start again we can stop again we can reset we can start and we can stop now the cool thing about doing this in react our stop watch is a reusable component if I were to go back to my app component I can include as many stopwatches as I would like let's include one two or even three these are all individual components that have their own code to run they all run independently and I can stop them whenever I would like all right everybody that is how to create a stopwatch component using react"
FpNfvbNYPsg,React useContext() hook introduction 🧗‍♂️,2024-01-09T18:27:37Z,hey everybody today I got to explain use context in react use context is a react hook it allows you to share values between multiple levels of components without passing props through each level what we'll do in this example is create four components components a through D each component will be nested within one another so within our source folder let's create a new file for component a this will be a jsx file we will create a function based component named component a no parameters for now and be sure to export it export default component a within this component we will return some HTML we will return a div element the div element will have a class name of box within the div element we will create an H1 element that has text of component a within our app component we will import component a import component a from its location component a. jsx we will return a single component a component we're also going to add a little bit of CSS to visualize it we will select our class of box add a border of three pixel solid and padding of 25 pixels here's component a we're going to copy this file of component a and paste it three times we will rename the second copy as component B the third as component C the fourth as component D we have component a b c and d within component B rename any instance of component a with component B the same goes for C and D from component a we're going to import component B import component B from its location component b. jsx after our H1 element we will include one component B component we have component B within component a now within component B we will import component C import component C from its location component c. jsx after our H1 element we will include one component C component so we have component C within component B within component a within component C we will import component D import component D from its location component d. jsx after H1 element we will include one component D component we have component D within component C within component B within component a I've organized my tabs a b c d within component a we're going to create a state variable const user and a Setter for user equals the US state hook we will need to import it type in your username I'll type in bro code for mine at the top we need to import from react use object destructuring to get the use State Hook from its location of react now after our H1 element I will create an H2 heading we will embed some JavaScript we'll display a template string of hello add a placeholder your username name So within component a you should have an H2 heading that displays hello and your username within component D what if I would also like to display my username well from component a I would have to pass props down all the way to component D I'll have to pass them to B which will pass them to C which will pass them to D so if we were using props this is what we would have to do within component component B we will pass in props set user to equal our user within component B we'll have to set up props props will be the parameter within component C we will set user to equal embed some JavaScript props do user within component C we'll set up props again within component D we will set user to equal embeds JavaScript props do user then within component D set up props again after our H1 element let's create an H2 element we'll embed some JavaScript use a template string display by add a placeholder access props our parameter access the user within component a we have hello your username within component D we have by your username by passing props down each of these nested components this is known as prop drilling where drilling down to the center the center component passing props down this long chain can become very tedious but there's a better solution and that is with the use context hook the use context hook allows us to share values between multiple levels of components without passing props down through each level however we have to set up a provider component component which component has the data we would like access to in this case it would be component a in component a we have that state variable of our username which we named user So within our provider component we have three steps we have to import create context from react So within component a we already have used state but we also need create context we need to create some context and Export it export const then we need a unique name for this context we're working with the username let's name our context user context the context name should be descriptive of what you're working with if the data we're working with is a color we could say color context equals create context and this is a function now the last thing we need to do is wrap any children components within this special provider component we are going to wrap component B within another component we will take our user context access provider set the value equal to be some Java Script our value of user and we just need to wrap this component of component B component a is now the provider component it's going to provide a value of user we no longer need props we can get rid of these for each component after I deleted props from component B well our username is now undefined within component D we broke that chain all right any component that needs this data we will set up to be a consumer component you can have more than one we'll have to import the use context Hook from react as well as the context that we set up we're exporting it so we need to import it elsewhere within component D we will import from react use object destructuring the use context Hook from its location of react we also need the user context import use object destructuring to get user context from its location of component a that was the original location where we exported it from we'll use the context get the context and store the value we'll do that inside of our component const user equals use context hook we're going to pass in our user context as an argument and now we have access to user we'll use a placeholder and add our user and that has appeared to work we have displayed by your username we have avoided prop drilling instead of drilling down to the center component to pass down a value by using use context we Traverse up the component tree to find the nearest provider which would be component a component a is the provider component component D is a consumer component and you can have more than one so let's do the same thing with component C we need these two lines of code really we can just copy them because I'm lazy and we need to create a con of user or some other descriptive name for this value use context pass in our context of user context let's add another H2 element we'll embed some JavaScript use a template string let's say hello again add a placeholder our username So within component C we have used use context again without prop Drilling we're displaying hello again your username any component that's a child component of our provider component of a has access to this value that we set up all right everybody so that is the use context react hook it allows you to share values between multiple levels of components without passing props through each level if you have a lot of nested components passing props down to each level can become very tedious this is a way to avoid that and well everybody that is the use context hook in react
AiQ-V_0qvRI,Build this digital clock with React! 🕒,2024-01-07T14:00:07Z,"hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can create a digital clock using react so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay let's get started everybody if you would like a background image for your app place that image within your assets folder here's the image that I'm going to use I found it online we will create a digital clock component within our source folder digital clock. jsx we will need to import two hooks import from react use object destructuring to get the use State hook as well as the use effect Hook from its location of react we're going to create a function based component of digital clock no parameters then be sure to export it at the end export default defaulty default digital clock we do need to return something for the time being we are going to return a fragment just so that everything runs back within our app component we need to import our digital clock component from its locationd digital clock. jsx we will include one digital clock component with our digital clock component we'll create the following HTML we will create a div element to contain everything this outer div element is going to have a class name of clock container within this development we will create a nested development this development will have a class name of clock we have a clock within a clock container within this inter div element we will create a span element to display a time until we get the time working let's display a bunch of zeros for the hours minutes and seconds and here's our time but it's a little small I'm zoomed in currently okay let's go to our CSS stylesheet we will select the following the body of our document our clock container class and our class of clock if you would like to add a background image here's what you can do within the body of your document we will set the background image property to be we will use the URL function within this function we will pass in a relative or absolute file path to your image from the index file we'll have to access the assets folder assets the name of the image my image is named background and this is a JPEG okay here's my image but it's a little big then we will take our background position property set it to be Center to Center the image now it does repeat we'll set the background repeat property to be no repeat we'll set the background size to cover to cover this develop the outer development background size cover now we'll take the background attachment property set it to be fixed as we adjust the size of the window the image is going to adjust accordingly and maintain its aspect ratio we do have a little bit of margin around the body of our document I'm going to remove that margin zero next we have to work on the clock itself it's a little small within the clock class I will set a color of white I'll increase the font size because we can barely see it to 6 RM that should be a decent size and a font weight of bold pick a font family I will pick monospace I think that'll look good for a clock I will also add a text Shadow effect with a horizontal and vertical offset of three pixels each and a blur of five pixels pick a color I'll pick black but I'll lower the alpha to 75% or so then I will Center Aline align my text text align Center our clock is centered horizontally but not vertically within the window if you would like the clock in the exact middle of the window here are some following optional CSS properties you can add these are optional we'll use flex box display Flex to display all the elements justify content Center to Center this clock vertically within the middle of our window we have to set the maximum height of the body to be 100% of the viewport height We'll add this following property set the minimum height of the body to be 100 VH for the viewport height 100% of the viewport height then use the Align items property set it to be Center to vertically align it and I think that looks pretty good now we'll select our clock container for the background of the clock container I would like it so it looks like we're looking through glass here's how to do that we will use the backdrop filter property use a function of blur pass in a number in an amount of pixels the greater the number the greater the blur here's five pixels here's 50 what's 500 look like okay let's go with 5 pixels we have a little bit of a blur effect if you would like the clock container to take up 100% of the viewport width you can add the following property set the width of the clock container to be 100 VW for viewport width so now the clock container takes up 100% of the width of the window then I'll add a little bit of padding to the top and bottom but not the sides padding 10 pixels for the top and bottom zero for the sides we should get a little bit of padding on the top and bottom I like that I think that looks pretty good okay we can save everything we no longer need our CSS stylesheet and now we will be working within the digital clock component we'll be using the UST State hook we will create a state variable of time const time and a Setter for time named set time equals the use State hook for the initial state of the US state hook we will pass in a new date object whatever the current date and time currently is that's what the initial state of time is going to be it will be an object we will also use the use effect hook we can perform some code during each render or when we Mount or anytime time some sort of value updates when this component mounts we'll start an interval to move the clock forward there's two parameters within use effect a function to do something and an array of dependencies for our function we'll use an arrow function parameters Arrow do this and for our dependencies based on the last video we're just going to set an empty array I would like to start a timer only when we Mount the component we don't need to start a new timer every time the component renders what would we like to do once when our component mounts we will create a constant of interval ID equals set interval with set interval we can pass in a call back and a time in milliseconds to repeat this call back let's do some code every 1,000 milliseconds meaning every 1 second let's do the following we'll write an arrow function to do this every 1,000 milliseconds we will update the state of time using our Setter of set time we will pass in a new date object and that's all we need so after every second we will update the state of time with the new current date and time now if we do unmount this component it would be good practice if we were to clear our timer if we don't it may lead to unexpected Behavior we will add a cleanup function when this component unmounts we will return the following do this function we will call the function to clear interval and pass in that interval ID to stop this interval if we ever unmount our digital clock we don't want it to continue running we want to free up any resources if we don't that may lead to unexpected Behavior so that is all we need with use effect when we Mount and that's it create an interval that updates once every second when we unmount the component clear that interval and that's it now we will also need a function to format time function format time there are no parameters we need to get the hours minutes and seconds of our time the state variable of time that's pretty simple though we will declare using let let hours equals our time State variable use the method of get hours let's do this with minutes let minutes actually let's declare this as const const minutes time.get minutes and seconds const seconds equals time.get seconds we will also find what the meridium is is it AM or PM we'll have to write the following const meridium equals let's examine our hours is our hours greater than or equal to 12 our time in hours is going to be in military time I believe that's 0 through 23 technically if ours is greater than or equal to 12 tary operator if this is true meridium will be PM otherwise meridium will be am with hours we're going to reassign it let's say that it is 1 p.m. so hours will be 13 1 hour after 12 if I don't want to display my time in military time I'm going to reassign hours we'll take hours modulus 12 modulus gives you the remainder of any division for example if ours is 13 13 modul 12 has a remainder of 1 so that's how you can convert from military time use modulus 12 what if hours is 12 12 modulus 12 is zero if it's 12:00 we don't want to display zero we can add the following use the or logical operator or return 12 if this equation is zero that is equivalent to false so using the or logical operator hours would instead equal 12 then within format time we're going to return one long template string we will display a placeholder with hours colon a placeholder with minutes colon a placeholder with seconds space placeholder our meridium then within our span element we will display embed some JavaScript called The Format time function here's the current time for me it is 7:52 at night p.m. and the time is updating now we have a problem if one of our units of time is a single digit we don't have any leading zeros so let's fix that we will declare a function function pad Z there's one parameter we have to pass in a number with ours minutes and seconds we will pass each of these units of time to the pad zero function so we will enclose each of these within the pad zero function then return a result so let's pad our hours with zero pad our minutes with zero and Pad seconds with zero okay we have undefined undefined undefined that's okay so within pad zero we have to return something we need to check to see if our number is a single digit we can do that with checking to see if number is less than 10 if it is it's a single digit we'll use the tary operator is our number a single digit is it less than 10 if that's true we're going to return a string of zero if not we don't have to do anything we'll return an empty string we will take all of this and close it within a set of parentheses return either zero or an empty string plus the original number for example if our number was one one is less than 10 that is true we'll return a string of zero then new string catenation and add our original number of one so we would return 0 1 if our number was 12 well this condition is false we would return an empty string plus the original number of 12 which would give me a string of 12 so here's the result we have each unit of time with the leading zero if it needs it and we have successfully created a digital clock component and the cool thing about doing this in react is that we can reuse this component whenever we want we can create one digital clock component or another or another or another and Let me refresh these to synchronize them these are all individual components running their own code all right everybody so that is how to create a digital clock component using react"
L-1sP3Ljhsg,React useEffect() hook introduction 🌟,2024-01-06T14:34:56Z,"hey everybody we have an important topic to discuss today and that is the use effect react hook use effect is a react hook basically speaking use effect tells react to do some code when then pick one of the following do some code when this component rerenders or do this code when the component mounts when you mount a component that's when you create and append it to the domum that is known as mounting or do some code when the state of a value changes think of an effect as some side code you would like to perform I don't really think use effect is a great name if I could rename use effect I feel like a more appropriate name would be use side side code but that's just my opinion so think of an effect SM side code you'll write your side code within a function this can be a callback an anonymous function or an arrow function and optionally for the second argument you can pass in an array of dependencies if we would like to run our side effect on every render of the component we would just need to pass in a function such as an arrow function do this code every time the component reenders if you would like to perform some side code only when the component mounts and not during every render you would pass in an empty array of dependencies that tells react perform this code only once when the component mounts within your rave dependencies if you were to pass in a value this code would run when the component mounts plus when this value changes use effect has a bunch of different uses you'll see use effect with event listeners do manipulation subscriptions to realtime updates fetching data from an API and cleanup when a component unmounts unmounting is when you remove a component from the Dom whereas in mounting is adding a component to the Dom okay let me give you a few examples if in order for us to use use effect we have to import it from the react Library we have use State as well as use effect in this example we're going to create a count State variable const count and a Setter for count set count equals use State the initial state of count will be zero and we'll display our count within our return statement let's create one paragraph element that has text of count as well as our state variable of count and a button let's create a button element that has text of add when we click on ADD we will add one to our count we'll need a function to work with I will set the onclick event handler equal to a JavaScript function let's name this function add count then we just need to declare this function function add count all we'll do is use our Setter for count take the previous state of count as a parameter Arrow do this take the previous state of count add one every time I press the button we will add one to count now let's use use effect I can run some side code at every time this component rerenders I would just have to place that code within a function that will pass to use effect every time this component rerenders I will change the title of the document we'll need to use use effect be sure to place use effect near the top of your component we will call use effect there are two arguments a function and an array of dependencies I would like to perform some code every time the component reeners I do not need that second argument now we just need a function this can be a callback an anonymous function or an arrow function we're going to be using an arrow function every time this component rerenders what would we like to do let's access our document access the title set it equal to be a template string of count and insert our state variable of count Let me refresh every time this component renders including initially when we Mount the component we will perform this code where we update the title every time I press the added button the title is going to update if you would like your side code to run only when the component mounts when we create and add it to the Dom initially you'll pass in as a second argument an empty array an empty array of dependencies so if I were to run this again and press add well our title only updates once and no other time after that for example I might want to set my title to be my counter program I only need to update this title once I don't need to update it every time the component rerenders it's a oneandone effect in this case case I would like to add an empty array of dependencies because if I didn't well we would update this title every time the component rerenders when we really don't need to in this specific example it doesn't benefit us to update the title every time we add one to count let's revert those changes back you could pass in a value to your array of dependencies within your array of dependencies you can add a value let's add our count State variable what we're telling react is that when our component mounts plus when this value changes of count then do the side code so with what I have written currently every time I press the button the title is going to update if our count State variable updates perform our side code this is very similar to us not having that dependency array you know this will work too however since we don't have any dependencies this code is going to run for any reason that this component rerenders even for something completely unrelated by adding an array of dependencies and placing a value within do this code only when this value updates now to demonstrate we'll create another button to subtract the text will be subtract we'll create a function to subtract count we can copy this function paste it change the name to subtract count take the previous state of count minus one so if our count changes whether we add one or minus one the title of our document is still going to change if the value of count changes for any reason do the side code let's add another value to our dependency array we will create a state variable for color color and set color equals use State the initial state for my color will be green we'll flip between green and red green means go red means stop after our subtract button I will add a break and button two change the color change color the onclick event handler will equal this function of change color and we just need to Define this function function change color we will use the setter for set color we will use the previous state of color is the previous state of color strictly equal to Green trar operator is this true if it is return Red otherwise return green then we will take our paragraph of count access the style attribute set it equal to embed some JavaScript we need a JavaScript object so we need another set of curly braces take the color property set it equal to our color State variable so now the count is green with our title let's also add the color so I'm not going to add our color to our dependency array quite yet we can add the title updates we can subtract the title still updates but if we change the color the color changes of this paragraph element but not the title we're executing this code only when the count changes so even though I'm flipping between red and green the title is still staying the same if I were to add our color to our dependency array anytime the count or the color changes update the title so let's try this again the title updates when I add or subtract or change the color now the title is count one red count one green count one red count one green so that's where your dependency array comes in anytime one of these values change perform the side code now you may have noticed noed if you remove use effect well your title is still going to update so why would you need use effect there are a couple benefits of using use effect the first benefit is that by using use effect it keeps your code more organized if you were to look over some react code and look within the use effect hook you could tell when exactly this code runs does it run during every render only when the component mounts or when one of these values change if you didn't use use effect well then this code would run every single time regardless every time the component rerenders which you may not always want but not only that but with more advanced features such as event listeners or subscriptions you may want to remove or free up those resources you can return a cleanup function if you were to return a function when this component unmounts when we remove it from the Dom or before the next render you can perform some cleanup code for example if we were to add an event listener when the component mounts we would like to remove it before unmounting if we don't it may lead to unexpected Behavior so that's another benefit of using use effect perform some code only in certain situations and you do have the option to do some cleanup code before the next render or when you unmount the component discuss the return statement in this next demonstration and how it can be useful in this next example we're going to create a width and a height what the width and the height of our window is every time we adjust the size of the window the width and the height displayed is going to change we'll need two State variables to work with a width set width we will be using U state so the initial state of the width of the window access our window give me the inner width property then let's do this with height const height set height window do inner height within our return statement we will create a paragraph element that has text of window width we will display our width statement variable then add pixels for a unit of measurement then let's do this with height window height display our height State variable so we have window width and window height if I were to adjust this window nothing happens there's no change let's create a function to handle resize function handle resize no parameters we're going to set our width to be the inner width property of our window and set height H should be Capital set height take our inner height of our window and reset it so now we need to add an event listener because this still doesn't change we're going to add an event listener that will listen for a resize event whenever we resize our window if we attempt to use this without use effect but within the body of our component we will take our window add an event listener we need an event and a function to do something the event is going to be a resize event when the window is resized perform this code we will pass in a call back to handle resize and then for demonstration purposes I'm going to console.log event listener added we only need one event listener to make this program work now if I were to resize my window this does work our width State variable changes same thing goes with the height now let's take a look at our console there's an issue we only need one event listener to make this program work however every time the component rerenders we're adding a new event listener we've added over 1,000 event listeners that's really not good how about this only when our component mounts when we append it to the Dom we will add one event listener and that's it so guess what we're going to place our code within use effect we will pass in a function and an array of dependencies when would we like to add an event listener let's add an event listener only when the component mounts so we need to add an empty array of dependencies let's try that again I'm going to resize our window that should be good go to inspect yeah you can ignore all this garbage so if you have strict mode on which I do use effect is going to run twice it will run a development only setup and then a cleanup cycle so this is normal so we didn't add thousands of event listeners besides the first cleanup cycle because I have strict mode on we're only adding one event listener because that's all we need we don't need thousands of event listeners if you ever need to unmount the component meaning remove it from the Dom use effect has another use and that is is adding a return statement to do any cleanup you will return a function do this code either before the next reender or when the component unmounts if we add an event listener then we unmount the component it would be good practice to remove that same event listener if you don't that can lead to unexpected behavior when we unmount our component we will take our window then remove event listener we will remove the event of resize and a call back to handle resize when we are done with this component free up any resources so that it doesn't lead to unexpected Behavior let me add one more line of code too let's console.log event listener removed let's refresh resize our window a few times go to inspect console okay let's take a look since I am in strict mode we'll run our use once during the development cycle and then clean it up right away then we will add that event listener only once we didn't unmount this component yet so we didn't remove it so by adding a return statement you can do any cleanup either before the next Reen or when you unmount the component within a component you can add more than one use effect hook we're going to add a second use effect hook if the width or the height changes we're going to update the title of our document to display the width and the height so let's add another use effect hook use effect what code would we like to perform let's access our document take the title set it equal to be let's use a template string let's say size placeholder width x height when would we like to use this effect let's use this effect when the width and the height update we will need that dependency array we will list the width and the height State variables so on Mount we'll get the size right away 227 by 396 now every time the width and the height changes the title is going to update so you can have more than one use effect hook within your component all right everybody so that is the use effect hook it's a react hook that tells react to do the code when either the component rerenders this component mounts or the state of a value changes there are two arguments a function that contains the code you would like to perform and optionally an array of dependencies based on what you pass in to use effect you'll either run this code after every rerender run only when the component mounts or run when the component initially mounts plus when the value changes use effect is great with event listeners Dom manipulation subscriptions to real-time updates fetching data from an API or clean up when a component unmounts we will have more practice with use effect in the next video where we will create a digital clock and well everybody that is an introduction to use effect in react"
VaDUGPMjzOM,Create a weather app with JavaScript! ☀️,2023-12-30T21:13:30Z,hey everybody so in today's video we're going to create a weather app that fetches data from an API you can look up any City and get the weather if that sounds good to you then sit back relax and enjoy the show if you would like to follow along you will need your own API key the API that we'll be using is openweathermap.org you do need to sign up for an account though it is free to sign up for an account you can go to sign in if you're currently not registered you can create an account for free once you're signed in you'll need an API key go to my API Keys it may take you some time to get an API key generated for you mine took about 15 minutes and once you get it make sure it's active we will need that API key about 20 minutes into this topic hopefully for you by then it'll be generated okay let's do this everybody we will Begin by creating a form element the form element will have a class of weather form our form element is going to have an input element and a button within this input element we'll type in the name of the city we would like to retrieve the weather data 4 so the type of this input element is going to be text for some text the class will be City input so a user can type in the city and we'll add a placeholder let me zoom in a little so you can see it the placeholder will equal enter City then we'll need a button let's create a button element with text of get weather the type of this button will be submit it's the submit button for our form after retrieving the weather data we'll display the weather data in a card format like a Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh card so we will create a develop with a class of card but before applying some CSS we should at least add some placeholder elements so we can style them and see the changes for the time being let's create an H1 element we will be deleting these elements later so don't get too attached I will set the class of this element to be City display We'll add a sample City let's say Miami or pick a city if you're choosing then I will create a paragraph element the class will be temp display meaning temperature let's say the temperature is 90° F or pick something in celsius if you're on Windows to add a degree symbol you can hold alt then type 0176 Miami is going to be 90° F then we'll create a paragraph element for the humidity class equals humidity display for the text next let's say humidity colon space then a percentage 75% then we need a description of the weather this will be another paragraph element the class will equal description display desk meaning description for the description let's say clear skies I'll also display an emoji depending on what the weather is the class will be weather Emoji I'll use a sun for some reason if we can't display the weather data such as if we can't locate a city let's add the following paragraph the class of this element will be error display We'll add the text of please enter a city that is all the HTML that we need for now we're going going to apply some CSS styling next so now let's head to our CSS style sheet we are going to select the body of our document select a font family I will pick Ariel with a backup of s serif I'll change the background color of the body background color pick a color I'm going to use hsl values I will set the lightness to be 95% so it's a light gray color I will set that all margin around the body to be zero then I'll use flex box to display the elements display Flex the flex direction will be a column to arrange all the elements in a column then align item Center to horizontally align all the elements align item center now we'll select the class of weather form that'll be this form that has an input element and a button all we'll do is add a little bit of margin around the entire form 20 pixels then we'll select our city input that's going to be the text box class of City input I will add some padding of 10 pixels let me zoom out to 100% increase the font size to 2 RM set the font weight to be bold I'll add a border two pixel solid and pick a color but all lower the alpha so it's transparent to 30% there's our border currently border radius around the corners let's do 10 pixels add some margin of 10 pixels that'll separate this element from the button and set a width of 300 pixels okay let's style the button next okay we are going to select all buttons that have an attribute where the type equals submit so that's going to be for our submit button that says get weather let me scroll down okay I'm going to add some padding around the button 10 pixels by 20 pixels I'll set the font weight to be bold I'll increase the font size to be to RM pick a background color for the button I'll pick something green but I'll use hsl values I've already pre-picked a color let's go with 122 39% and 50% that's a good shade of green I will set the color to be white for the font color remove the border border none and Border radius 5 pixels to round the corners then when we hover our cursor over the button I would like it to be a pointer and that does work when we hover our cursor over the button we'll use the hover sudo class to change the background color so let's take our button for the type attribute is submit access the hover sudo class take our background color make it a little bit darker I'll bring down the lightness by 10% so it's at 40% so that does in fact work okay then we're going to select our card class that contains all the weather data so we will select the class of card for the background we're going to do something a little bit different we're going to use a linear gradient instead of selecting the background color we will select the background I will use the linear gradient function there's three arguments think of a linear gradient as a slow transition between two colors we need an angle in degrees we'll say 180° for now then a color let's pick something blue and orange I'm going to pick some colors that look a little bit better so for blue let's set the Hue to be 210 100% for the saturation and the lightness will be 75% that's a good shade of blue and for orange we'll use another hsl value for the Hue I'll say 40% the saturation will be 100% And The lightness will be 75% so I'm hoping with this linear gradient the background color looks kind of like a sunrise or a sunset once we have our background I will add some padding of 50 pixels I'll add a box Shadow to this card we'll add a vertical and horizontal offset of 2 pixels each and a blur effect where the radius is 5 pixels then we'll pick a color I'm just going to lower the alpha to 50% not bad this gives our card a 3D pop effect I will set a minimum width of this card to be 300 pixels then we have to align everything within it I'll use flex box because I like Flex box display Flex Flex direction will be a column and align items Center to horizontally align the items there we go then we'll select all H1 elements that's going to be our city name select all H1 elements increase the font size to be 3 .5 RM I'll remove any margin from the top margin top will be zero and add margin to the bottom of 25 pixels then we'll select all paragraphs that's going to be everything underneath our city select all paragraphs increase the font size to 1.5 RM there's a lot of a natural margin between the paragraphs let's set all margin to be zero to see what it looks like okay let's add a little bit of margin five pixels on the top and bottom zero margin on the sides that's a lot better we'll select the city display and the temperature display we're going to be selecting two classes City display comma our temp display take these two classes apply the following properties you know what for our font size let's set that to be 3.5 RM we can honestly remove that from H one for the font weight I will set that to be bold for the color I'll make the color a little transparent I'll set the alpha down to 75% so that our city and our temperature they're both going to be transparent then I'll add some margin to the bottom margin bottom 25 pixels okay let's select our humidity display class humidity display set the font weight to be bold and add some margin to the bottom of 25 pixels then we'll select our description display which we shortened to desk display for the font style I will set it to be italic and the font weight will be bold I'll increase the font size to 2 RM then we'll select our weather Emoji so class weather Emoji remove all margin around the Emoji margin zero then we'll increase the font size of the Emoji the size will be 7.5 RM so it's kind of big then if for some reason we display an error we'll display this text so this class is error display I'll set the font size to be 2.5 RM the font weight will be bold I'll set the color to be something transparent all over the alpha to 75% okay that is all the CSS that we need let's go back to our HTML file we can delete everything within the card class we just wanted to see what it would look like with the elements populated with our card element I will set the style attribute to be take the display property set it to be none we don't want to display the card at all until we get the weather data until it's returned to us our HTML is done our CSS is done then we're ready to add some JavaScript functionality we'll declare our constants that we need const weather form equals document dot now since we're not working with IDs we can't get element by ID we're working with classes we can use Query selector or query selector all so I'm going to use Query selector this will return the first element in this class we only have one element with this class class WEA form we'll store a reference to it const City input equals document. query selector we are selecting the class of City input that's going to be this text box const card our card is what contains all the weather data document. query selector select the class of card and give me the first element now we'll need that API key const API key equals now here's my API key please don't try and use this one specifically I will be deactivating it at the end of this video hopefully by now you should have that API key given to you first we'll take our weather form we'll add an event listener this is our form the text element and the submit button when we click on this button the event type is going to be submit after we attempt to submit this form we'll do the following code we'll have one parameter an event that's going to be provided to us Arrow do this we'll fill this in later we'll declare our functions that we need we will need an async function to get weather data there will be one parameter a city that's going to be passed in then we'll need a function to display weather info there will be one parameter data the data will be in a Json like format we'll create a function to get weather Emoji based on what the weather is there will be one parameter a weather ID then we'll create a function to display to the screen any errors if there are any function display error there will be one parameter a message a message to be displayed to the window within our event listener once we have a submit event once we click the button forms do have a default Behavior where they'll refresh the page we would like to prevent that so let's take our event use the prevent default method to prevent the default behavior for a form we don't want to refresh the page then we'll have to get the city the value within this text box const City equals take the city input access the value store it within this variable it should be a string we'll use an if statement if City if there's a value within here this will be true we can use it within an if statement if there is a city do this else we'll call the display error function else we will display an error we will pass along the message to please enter a city let's fill in the dis display error function we want to be sure that it works before continuing the display error function is at the bottom we'll be provided with a message to display we will create a constant of error display equals document now we'll create an element create element we will create a paragraph then we'll need to change the text content of this element error display access the text content set it equal to be our message then we're going to add the class of error display we would like these CSS properties take our error display element access the class list then we will add a class we will add the CSS class of error display then we will take our card element which normally displays the weather data take our card reset the text content if there is something there we'll set it to be an empty string so normally with our card the display is set to none we'll set the display to be a block or even Flex access our card access the style access the display and I will set the display to be Flex to display it we will take our card we will append a child element append child we will append this paragraph of error display to the card now if I were to not type in anything and just press get weather we get this error message please enter a city to our card I'm just going to round the corners to make it look better border radius let's do 10 pixels that's better okay moving on if we do have a city if there's text within here we will try some code because it might cause some errors we will catch any errors that happen we have one parameter of error if there's an error we can console.log or console. error the error then let's call our display error function we'll pass along the error and display it now we need to get the weather data within our Tri block we will create a constant of weather data equals now we need to await get weather data function and pass in our city so with the weight we can only use a weight within an async function since we're within an arrow function we could declare this Arrow function as an a sync function so let's precede our event parameter with a sync so that we can use a wait we're going to wait for this function to return the weather data once we receive our weather data we will call the display weather info function and pass along that data the weather data okay this function is complete once you've typed everything in I'm going to close this function and we can close our display error function too now once we want to get our weather data after we have a city now we actually need to fetch the weather data we'll have to create a URL we'll create a constant of API URL this is what we'll pass to the fetch function we will use a template string be sure to use a pair of back ticks we'll need to get the following URL at this web page we need to find the API call where we can pass in a city name we can copy this within our template string we'll paste it we'll replace the city name with the placeholder and use our city variable for the API key we'll use a placeholder pass in the API key this is what we'll pass to the fetch function we will create a response const response equals a wait we can use a weight because we're within an async function we will fetch our API URL once we have a response let's check our response let's console.log our response just to see what it is okay I will type in the city of Miami get weather our data should be within console.log here's our response it has a status of 200 and it's okay we need to check to see if our response is not okay what if we couldn't retrieve the data I'll make up some gibberish City let's go to inspect console we have a response status 404 the response is not okay we'll write an if statement if our response is not okay we will throw a new error and pass along this message could not fetch weather data else if our response is okay we will return the response and we will await our response convert it to a Json format using the Json method so at the end of this function return an object that's in a Json like format this data is going to be returned to our event listener after we get our weather data we need to display it we'll work on the display weather info function next this one let's console.log the data we receive I will type in Miami so it looks like that worked we have a name of Miami for the city we have the weather which is an array it's an array of objects we have coordinates clouds pretty much anything you can think of regarding the weather let's get the name within main there is temperature the temperature will be in kelvin we need to convert it I'll get the humidity within weather it's an array of objects we will get the description overcast clouds and this ID eventually we'll use the ID to return an emoji there's different weather codes I'll explain that later so we're going to use some object destructuring const use object destructuring with a set of krly brackets we will access the name property and create a variable of city city will be Miami in this case then we will access main main is a property that contains an array take main use object destructuring again now we're within a nested object I would like the temp and the humidity then let's select our weather so whether it's an array of objects we'll have to use array destructuring followed by object destructuring give me the description and the ID we have to set this all equal to data to use destructuring and let me organize this to make it look nice our data is one gigantic object that has nested objects and nested arrays so after destructuring we'll have these variables the city the temperature the humidity a description of the weather and an ID for the weather code now we can use these like variables so with our card currently we're not displaying it now I would like to display it we are going to take our card set the text content to be an empty string if there's already some text here we would like to reset it such as if there was an error message take our card access it style set the display property to be Flex for Flex box just to be sure that this is working I'm going to get the weather without entering a city after we do type in a city it should reset that's good that's what we wanted or if we make up some gibberish we have that error could not fetch weather data but then if we type in something legitimate and get the weather it'll reset that's what we would like okay now we have to create the elements the elements that we previously deleted from the div element we need to recreate those we will create a constant for City display to display the city document. create element our city display was an H1 element let's copy this line of code and paste it a few times four additional times we have City display temp display for the temperature that was a paragraph element humid humidity display humidity display that was also a paragraph element a description display which we shortened to desk desk display that was also a paragraph and a weather Emoji weather emoji and that was also a paragraph okay now we need to change the text content of each of these elements but they're empty so to say let's take the text content of our city display. text content property equals our city variable that we destructured okay let's see if that works I'll type in a city get weather oh and then we need to append it take our card append child we will append the city display element let's try that again type in Miami get the weather that should display Miami let's try Dallas Texas Dallas Oh and before displaying it we need to add the class list the CSS class for the city display after adding the text content we will take our city display access its class list add the class the CSS class of City display so then when we type in a city we should have that CSS styling all right now we have to add the temperature following the same format we will take our temp display access the text content equals I'll use a template string with a pair of back ticks I'll add a placeholder pass in our temperature add a degree symbol you can hold alt then type 0176 for a degree symbol now this is normally in kelvin actually I don't think Kelvin uses the degree symbol but we'll be changing that momentarily take our temperature display access its class list add the following class add the CSS class of temp display then we have to append the element to the card element take our card we will append a child element of temperature display so now we should see the temperature but it's going to be in kelvin we have the city and the temperature for the temperature if you would like celsi let's use de C you have to subtract from the temperature 273.15 okay but now we should probably round it so let's enclose this equation with a set of parentheses follow this with the two fixed method of numbers to round it to one decimal place 15.6 de C if you would like a Fahrenheit temperature this is the formula take our temp in kelvin minus 273.15 we will multiply this by 9 / 5 + 32 so let's enclose this all within a set of parentheses so now we should get that temperature but in Fahrenheit oh and then add F to the end 60° F then we'll get the humidity so take our humidity display element that we created access the text content set it equal to be a template string using a pair of back ticks let's add the word humidity col in space add a placeholder display our humidity variable We'll add the class list of humidity display humidity display access its class list add the following class of humidity display then we have to append the element to the card element card. append child append our humidity display so we should get the humidity Miami 60° fah humidity 81 let's add percent 81% yep that does work then we'll add the description a description of the weather take the element of description display access the text content equals the description then add the CSS class to the class list for this element description display access the class list add the following class of description display then add the element card. aend child we will append our description display let's type in Miami get the weather currently in Miami there's overcast clouds now we have to get an emoji based on the weather with our element of weather Emoji we will access the text content equals we will call the get weather Emoji function but we have to pass in a weather ID so we will pass in the ID variable that we receive from data once we get our weather Emoji we'll work on that momentarily we'll take our element of weather Emoji access the class list add the following CSS class of weather emoji then append it to the card card. append child we will append our weather Emoji all right now before we canest it we need to fill in the get weather Emoji function so with this open Weather AI there are different group codes so our weather ID is going to be either within the 200 range meaning a thunderstorm the 300 range means drizzle 500 is rain 600 is snow 700 is atmosphere such as Mist smoke or even a tornado 800 exactly is a clear sky anything greater than 800 means clouds so our weather ID is going to be one of these codes so we're going to use a switch we will examine the Boolean value of true does the value of true match one of these cases we'll have a case for group 200 if our weather ID that we pass in is greater than or equal to 200 and the weather ID is less than 300 that means there's a thunderstorm we will return an emoji a thunderstorm Emoji thunderstorm I don't like the look back one that's better okay group 300 is a drizzle so let's copy this case because I don't feel like retyping it if our weather ID is greater than or equal to 300 and less than 400 that means we have a drizzle we'll just add an emoji of a raining Cloud so group 500 is also rain but it's a heavier rain so let's copy this case paste it if our weather ID is greater than or equal to 500 and less than 600 will return rain as well group 600 is snow if our weather ID is greater than or equal to 600 and less than 700 we will return a snowflake meaning snow then we have group 700 if our weather ID is greater than or equal to 700 and less than 800 we'll return some fog Emoji 800 exactly means a clear sky we can display the Sun if our weather ID is strictly equal to 800 exactly we'll return a sun emoji anything within the 800 range means clouds so if our weather ID is greater than or equal to 801 800 means clear sky so with this group code it only goes up to 809 if our weather ID is less than 810 return a cloud then let's add a default in case we get a weird weather code default return I don't know a question mark we get some unknown weather phenomena UFOs or something I don't know okay and I think that should be everything let's close out of this close out of these functions and now if I were to type in Miami and get the weather in Miami it is 60.3 De F humidity 81% there's overcast clouds and we get a cloud Emoji because it's cloudy let's try Dallas we have a clear sky 45° F humidity 63% clear sky and we get a sun emoji all right everybody so that is a weather app that you can make using JavaScript HTML and CSS
9j1dZwFEJ-c,JavaScript ASYNC/AWAIT is easy! ⏳,2023-12-21T17:23:12Z,hey everybody so today I got to talk about a sync and a weight in JavaScript a sync and a weight are two keywords by using these two keywords together they allow you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner a sync makes a function return a promise a wait makes an async function wait for a promise we'll discuss async first in this sample program from the last topic we have some chores to do we have to walk the dog clean the kitchen and take out the trash each of these functions returns a promise a promise that can either resolve or reject based on the code that's written if the dog is walked if that's true resolve if it's false reject a function can be declared with a sync a function declared with a sync will return a promise however that promise that's returned doesn't resolve or reject in a way you could say it's an empty promise if I were to run this code this is what happens uncaught reference error resolve is not to find if an asynchronous function returns a promise that either needs to resolve or reject adding a sync to it really doesn't benefit us a sync works together with a weight by using these two keywords together when calling all of these asynchronous functions in order we don't need to Method chain then statements there's a more synchronous manner in which we can write the same code but we'll need to contain it all within an async function async function we'll create a function to do chores then we will need to call this function somewhere let's do so right here first we need to walk the dog walk the dog returns a promise that's where the await keyword comes in await makes an async function wait for a promise before continuing we're going to create a constant of walk dog result equals use the await keyword await walk Dot then we will console.log the walk dog result you walk the dog now let's do this with clean kitchen we're going to be writing this code in a synchronous manner line by line linearly we will create a constant for clean kitchen result equals await the next promise await clean kitchen then console.log clean kitchen result let me close this you walk the dog you clean the kitchen and last we have takeout trash const takeout trash result equals a wait take out the trash then console.log the result you walk the dog you clean the kitchen you take out the trash let's add one more line when we finish everything one more line of code you finished all the chores you walk the dog you clean the kitchen you take out the trash you finished all the chores let me show you what happens if we attempt to use a weight within a function not declared with async uncaught syntax error a weight is only valid in async functions that's why a weight depends on async a weight makes an async function wait for a promise before continuing now if your promises can reject let's say that dog walked is false uncaught in promise you didn't walk the dog we'll surround all of this code within a tri block then catch any errors catch one parameter of error we can console.log or console. error the error you didn't walk the dog all right everybody so that is a sync and a wait a sync makes a function return a promise a wait makes an async function wait for a promise by using these two keywords together we can write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner and well everybody that is a sync and a wait in JavaScript
NOzi4wBHn0o,What are JavaScript PROMISES? 🤞,2023-12-21T14:39:25Z,"what's going on everybody so in today's video I got to talk about promises in JavaScript A promise is an object an object that manages asynchronous operations such as querying a database fetching a file Gathering resources those you could consider asynchronous operations they can take an indeterminate amount of time you can wrap a promise object around some asynchronous code the promise object promises to return a value that promise object will be pending then either that promise will be resolved D if the task completed successfully or rejected if it failed for some reason maybe the promise couldn't fetch that file resolved if it did A promise is an object we'll create a new promise object with new promise then pass in a function usually you see this is an arrow function there's two parameters resolve and reject Arrow then do some asynchronous code so in this demonstration we're going to be doing some chores if you live with your parents maybe your mom asked you to do these chores or with the roommate these are the tasks you need to do or your significant other wants you to do these tasks anyways we have some chores to do we have to walk the dog clean the kitchen and take out the trash I'll create functions for each of these chores first we'll start by using callbacks then I'll demonstrate the use of promises and how they're helpful so let's create a function to walk dog to make this asynchronous I'm going to add a set timeout function this takes a call back and an amount of time in milliseconds to to complete this code let's say walking the dog takes 1,500 milliseconds what code would we'd like to perform let's write an arrow function to keep it simple parameters Arrow do this let's console.log after completing this chore you walk the dog okay that'll be the first function let's create a function to clean the kitchen function clean kitchen this will take a long time 2,500 milliseconds let's say when we complete this task we will print you clean the kitchen and a third function take out trash you take out the trash taking out the trash it's really quick it takes half a second 500 milliseconds if I need to do these chores in order I would need to use some callbacks after walking the dog we will call a call back to clean kitchen after we clean the kitchen we will take out the trash we need to modify these functions so that they accept some call backs after our code is complete we will invoke the call back call the call back so let's add that par parameter to each of these functions now if we want to call all these functions in order we would have to start using call back hell which we learned about in the last video so first I would like to walk the dog I will call that function pass in a call back but we'll use an arrow function then we will clean the kitchen pass in a call back I'll use an arrow function take out trash and we'll pass in a call back to do this when we complete all the chores console.log you finished all the chores okay let's see if this works you walk the dog you clean the kitchen you take out the trash you finished all the chores if we have a lot of call backs to work with we'll end up going to call back hell you don't want to go to call back hell so what we'll use instead are promises with all of this asynchronous code we'll wrap it within a promise by using a promise we don't need callbacks instead of using callbacks we'll use method chaining we'll method chain our promises here's how how we'll modify these functions is that at the end of each function we will return an object return a new promise return a new promise object and follow this formula we have two parameters resolve and reject resolve Sol reject Arrow do this asynchronous code within an arrow function take all of the asynchronous code cut it place it within the promise our promise promises to return a value it's either going to be resolved or rejected we're going to modify this function we don't need to work with call backs anymore we can get rid of those get rid of the parameter and the portion of the code where we call the call back if we would like to display a message when the pr promise resolves when it finishes successfully we will instead call the resolve parameter it's a function this message is the value the argument that we're passing in after you finish walking the dog here's your completion message when the promise resolves let's modify the rest of the functions so that they use promises we will return a new promise two parameters resolve reject Arrow do this asynchronous code let's cut our current asynchronous code paste it remove the call back parameter we don't need it anymore and we don't need to call the call back when this promise resolves pass along this message you clean the kitchen let's do this with take out trash we will return a new promise two parameters resolve reject Arrow do this cut the asynchronous code paste it within the promise remove the call back and where we call the Callback when we resolve this promise pass along this message we no longer need to use callback hell instead we're going to use method chaining first we're going to walk the dog clean the kitchen and then take out the trash in that order we will call the walk dog function and then we're going to Method chain follow this with the then method walk the dog then what is what we're saying the walk dog function does provide a value parameter this message we can use that message for something that's going to be stored within value that's going to be the parameter that's provided to us take the value let's print it console.log my value so when I run this program we should only be walking the dog you walk the dog and nothing else looks like I misspelled resolve as resolves there after walking the dog I would like to clean the kitchen so I need to call that function next within our Arrow function we'll write more than one statement we need to enclose this within a set of curly braces print our value and then do this function return clean kitchen and then call it we'll add another then method then take the value provided by clean kitchen that will be this one take that value arrow console.log that value you walk the dog you clean the kitchen then we'll take out the trash at the end We'll add another statement to this then method we will return take out trash invoke this method then we will take the value provided to us when it resolves this value do this code console.log that value you walk the dog you clean the kitchen you take out the trash so after taking out the trash that's our last chore let's add another line of code after displaying you take out the trash let's console.log you finished all the chores you walk the dog you clean the kitchen you take out the trash you finished all the chores by Method chaining then methods it's a lot easier to write than nesting call backs now sometimes times with asynchronous functions depending on the task the task May Fail let's say we're trying to locate a resource a file if we can't locate that file and we're using promises we don't want to resolve that promise because we couldn't locate that file instead we want to reject that's what happens when an asynchronous function fails to do something when inside a promise so let's change our functions around within set timeout let's create a variable const dog walked did we accomplish this this will be true or false we'll use an if statement if dog walked then we will resolve it if we walk to the dog else we will reject we'll pass in a different value you didn't walk the dog okay let's do this with the other functions let's create a constant of kitchen cleaned equals true if our kitchen is cleaned if that is true we will resolve this promise you clean the kitchen else let's reject pass along this message you didn't clean the kitchen and lastly take out trash const trash taken out let's set that to be true if the trash is taken out resolve the promise else we will reject you didn't take out the trash if a promise might reject there's one more method we need to add to the end of this chain we need to add a catch method to catch any errors this will catch any rejects this is similar to error handling we'll be provided with one value an error Arrow do this let's console.log or even console. error the message provided to us with reject that's what the error is going to be will successfully walk the dog that will be true and cleaning the kitchen will be true but taking the trash out will be false we weren't able to complete this chore these are the results you walk the dog you clean the kitchen you didn't take out the trash how dare you we'll keep on completing these tasks until we fail at one of them so if walking the dog was false that was our first task this first promise was rejected we don't even attempt to resolve these other promises all right everybody so those are promises they're an object that manages asynchronous operations you can wrap a promise object around some asynchronous code these promise objects promis to return a value they will be pending until they complete then they'll either be resolved if that task completed successfully or rejected if it failed for some reason and well everybody those are promises in JavaScript"
9wiWzu_tRB0,Build this to-do-list app with React! ☝,2023-12-19T19:13:28Z,hey everybody in today's video I'm going to walk you through creating a to-do list app using react so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's do this everybody we'll need to create a new jsx file going to our source folder we will rightclick new file this component will be named too list. jsx this will be a function based component function to do list no parameters then let's be sure to export it because if I don't do it now I'm going to forget export default to do list we will be using the UST State hook we should import that import react use object destructuring I would like just the US state Hook from its location of react we do need to return something for now we're just going to return a fragment going back to our app component we need to import our to-do list component import to-do list from its relative file path do/ too list. jsx we will return one to-do list component and we are ready to move on within our to-do list component we will have two State variables const tasks tasks will be an array of strings we need a Setter function for tasks set tasks equal equals the use State hook the initial state of tasks is going to be an empty array but eventually we're going to populate this array with strings one string for each task to add and we will create a state variable for a new task new task is whatever we're currently editing with the text box we will be adding our new task to our array of tasks then we need a Setter function for new task set new task equals U State the initial state will be an empty string let's declare the functions we'll need throughout this program we will need a function to handle input change there will be one parameter and event this function is for our text box when we type in something we'll need a function to add a task function add task there will be no parameters function delete task there will be one parameter an index an index of the list item we would like to delete let me scroll down a function to move task up there is one parameter an index what is the index of the list item we would like to move up within our list and a function to move task down we will also accept an index okay and these are the functions we'll need until we fill these in I'm going to close these functions okay now we'll go to our return statement we have a lot of HTML elements to add we'll begin with a div element our div element will have a class name of to do list within this development we'll create an H1 element for a heading The Heading will be a to do list after this H1 element I'll create another div element within this div element I will create an input element this will be a self-closing tag just for readability I'm going to place each attribute on a new line we have a lot of attributes to write I will set the type of this input element to be text I'm going to zoom in so you can see it more easily I'll add a placeholder of enter a task dot dot dot enter a task I will set the value of this text box to be some JavaScript our new task State variable this one when we type within this input element we will use the onchain vent Handler equal to a callback to a JavaScript function a callback to handle input change we'll fill in this function since we're here going to handle input change we will use the setter for our new task access our event parameter access its Target access its value so when we type within the text box it should change e breakfast if we didn't set the new task and we type within the text box we don't see the text it doesn't change that's why we need this function so we can see the text when we write within the input element let's scroll back down to the bottom after our input element we will create a button element with text of add to add a task for the class name of the button we'll set the class name attribute of the button to be add button add- button I will set the onclick event handler equal to a JavaScript call back we will call the function of add task now temporarily until we apply some CSS I'll write a few tasks within our array just temporarily let's say our first task is to eat breakfast take a shower and walk the dog after our development we'll create an ordered list with a pair of O tags within this pair of O tags we'll be embedding some JavaScript we have a lot to write we're going to take all of our tasks and use the map method we will create a list item element for each task for each element with this this array we'll use the map method we're provided with two parameters the current element and the index of the current element but I'll rename this element parameter as task so it's more easily understandable within the map method we will use an arrow function what would we like to do with each task I'll put this on a new line we will create a list item a list item element So currently we have three list item elements now react wants to to add a key for each element so it can more easily keep track of each element with the opening list item tag I will set the key attribute equal to the current index within the list item element I will create a span element for some text the class name for this span element will be text this will be for the text of each list item element within the span element we will include the current task we have three tasks eat breakfast take a shower walk the dog after our span element we'll create a button element this button element will be for a delete button to delete this task this button will have a class name of delete dashb button I will set the onclick event handler equal to a call back a call back to delete task now we do have to pass in a parameter the index of the list item we would like to delete delete task pass in the current index with a call back if you add a set a parenthesis right away when we pass in an argument this will call the function right away instead we will use an arrow function to prevent that let's copy this button paste it we'll now create a move up button to move a task up if we need to change the priority the text on the button will be up but you know what I like to use emojis I'll use a pointer finger I think that would be more fun the class name will be move button on click will be set equal to a call back to move task up we'll be passing in the current index make sure that this is an arrow function too let's copy this button again paste it this next button will be for moove task down we can either write down for the text or I'll use an emoji for fun down all right and that is all the HTML that we need before we fill in these functions let's apply some CSS to everything I'm zoomed in to 100% currently let's select the container of to-do list this development so this has a class of to-do list let's change the font family to be aerial with a backup of s serif text align Center Des Center the text and add a little bit of margin to the top of 100 pixels let's select our H1 element increase the font size to 4 RM then we'll select all buttons increase the font size to 1.7 RM set the font weight to be bold add some padding around each button padding 10 piels by 20 pixels set the font color to be white we'll add some background color pretty soon remove the border border none border radius to smooth the corners by five pixels change our cursor to be a pointer when we hover over a button that does appear to work we'll add a transition effect when we hover over a button let's change the background color and have it ease after 0.5 seconds let's work on the background color of the buttons next we'll select the class of add button add dash button pick a background color I'll pick Green but I will use hsl values I've already pre-picked a color now when I hover my cursor over the add button access the hover suo class take the lightness make it 10% darker let's do this with the delete button let's copy what we have paste it for the next set change add to delete I'll pick a red color again I've already picked some values and when I hover make the shade 10% darker and the move buttons I'll make the move buttons blue again I've already picked a color not bad it looks like with the transition I forgot to add s for seconds that's better we'll work on the input element next so after our buttons let's select our input element we'll select all input elements that have a type attribute of text I'll increase the font size to 1.6 RM add a little bit of padding 10 pixels add a border two pixel solid pick a color I'll set the lightess to be 80% but lower the alpha to 50% not bad border radius to smooth the corners 5 pixels and for the font color H let's find something I'll just lower the alpha to 50% here's the text currently I'm happy with that we'll work on the list items we'll begin with our ordered list remove all padding padding zero so that should delete the numbers we will style each list item element increase the font size to 2 RM set the font weight to be bold add some padding of 15 pixels change to the background color I'll set the lightness to 97% add some margin to the bottom of each list item of 10 pixels to separate each of them add a border three pixel solid pick a color for the lightness I'll pick 85% and the alpha down to 75% border radius to round the corners 5 pixels for the elements within each list item I'll use flex box display Flex to align everything and align items Center I would like the text to take up as much space as possible so I will select the class of text use flexbox set it to One Flex one it's a shortcut for these three CSS properties Flex grow Flex shrink and flex bases this is more advanced Flex box if you set an element to have Flex one you're applying these three properties basically speaking that element should take up as much space as possible and grow and Shrink with the size of the web browser so all these buttons are going to be pushed to the right because the text wants to take up as much space as possible okay now we will select the class of our delete button and move button these two sets of buttons let's add some padding 8 pixels by 12 pixels increase the font size to 1.4 RM I'll add some margin to the left of each button margin left 10 pixels much better this is optional but I'm going to change the background color of the body of my document I will select the body change the background color I'll go with the dark gray color I'll set the lightness to 10% I'll also take our H1 element and set the font color to be white I think that looks pretty good but you don't necessarily need to change the background color if you don't want to our CSS is now done we just have to add some functionality let's go back to our to-do list component we'll begin with add task after hitting the add button we'll call this function to add a new task we have to get the text within this text box we'll use the setter for set tasks pass in a new array spread the current elements of tasks and add our new new task that state variable we should update this to use an updator function we will use the previous state of tasks represented as T Arrow spread the previous state of tasks represented as T we would like to clear this input element so we can set new task set it to be an empty string to reset it now we should be able to add a new task go to work and add and that has worked eat lunch now if somebody doesn't type in anything they can still add a task to prevent that within add task we'll wrap everything within an if statement take our new task use the trim method to remove any white space if after removing any white space if this is still strictly not equal to an empty string then add a new task so now when I try and add an empty task it doesn't do anything let's add some text go to work and that will work the add task function is now done let's work on delete task delete task provides us with an index an index of the element we would like to delete maybe I don't want to take a shower I'm only a little bit stinky So within delete task we will create a new array of updated tasks so we need to use the filter method take our array of tasks use the filter method with the filter method we're provided with an element and each index of that element during each iteration but we have a naming conflict we already have a parameter named index for the index we would like to delete we'll rename index within the filter method as I to differentiate it Arrow then a condition if the current index of I is strictly not equal to the index we would like to delete put it within our new array of updated tasks if these two indexes match we will filter it out we don't want it cuz we want to delete it then once we have our new array of updated tasks it should be missing that element now we're currently not using this element parameter even though it's provided to us a common convention that people do if a parameter should be ignored people will change this to an underscore that's a convention to say ignore this we will set our new tasks with our updated tasks and this is an array an array that's missing one element whichever one we filter out using the filter method now we should be able to delete an element I do not want to take a shower delete and I don't feel like going to work delete delete task is now done now we need to be able to move a task up or down using the directional buttons so let's work on task up first let's check to see if our index that's passed in as an argument is greater than zero if the element is already at the top we don't need to move it up further we need to create a new array of updated tasks equals spread the current tasks and create a new array of updated tasks to work with now we're going to use array destructuring to swap two elements within an array here's the formula we have the current index and the index minus one we will be swapping these with index minus one and the current index so take our updated tasks at the current index index and the updated tasks at index minus one set these equal to updated tasks at index minus one and updated tasks at the current index I do have a separate video on destructuring if you need a refresher this code will swap two elements within an array and then we will set our tasks using the setter function set tasks pass in our updated array and now we should be able to move an element up oops looks like we have two functions for move task up move task down all right let's see if this works and now we should be able to move these up with move task down we're going to copy everything with then move task up the condition is if our index is less than our task length property minus one if our element is already at the bottom we don't want to move down down any further take index + one and then update our tasks now we should be able to move tasks up and down and even add new tasks and delete tasks and of course to initially have no elements within this array we can delete all these so then we start with an empty array all right everybody so that is a somewhat extensive program to create a to-do list application using react
62qN2RcpIAE,Learn the JavaScript classList property easy! 💡,2023-12-16T19:49:10Z,hey everybody so in today's video I got to explain class lists in JavaScript class list is an element property it's used to interact with an elements list of classes meaning CSS classes by accessing the class list property of an element we can make reusable classes for many elements across your web page if I have a CSS class I can dynamically add remove toggle replace or check to see if an element contains a certain class so what we'll do in this example in our h HTML document is create a button the button will have text of my button the ID of this button will be my button we'll apply a little bit of CSS initially let's select the ID of my button we'll be applying just a few properties let's increase the font size to for RM oh not 43 for go back go back go back I'll add a little bit of margin of 10 pixels remove the border with border none border radius to smooth the corners 5 pixels and add a little bit of padding 10 pixels by 15 pixels that's good enough for now we're going to create a CSS class of enabled we won't apply it right away though we'll apply this class to this button using JavaScript if an element is enabled let's change the background color to be something blue I'm going to use hsl values though and I will set the font color to be white so this button doesn't have this class yet we'll add that in dynamically using JavaScript we'll create a reference to this button const my button will be the name then we need to select it document. getet element by ID the ID that I'm selecting is my button to add a class to an element take that element my button access the class list property follow this with the add method we will add the name of the class enabled and now my button is enabled we have appended the CSS properties dynamically so if I were to inspect this element I'll right click inspect we have added that class of enabled to the element so my button has an ID and a class of enabled to remove a class again take that element of my button access the class list we will use the remove method we will remove the class of enabled and it's gone let's right click on the element inspect so our class list is empty we have added and then removed that class of enabled we're going to create a new class now of hover when we hover over an element apply these CSS properties it's kind of like we're using the hover sudo class but we're using it a little bit different we can add or remove this class dynamically at will if we apply this class let's set a box Shadow to give the element a 3D pop effect for a horizontal and vertical offset let's set those to be zero each let's add 10 pixels for the blur effect and I will set the color to be I don't know let's set it to be black but set the alpha down to like 20% and then when I hover I would also like to set the font weight of that element to be bold let's add the hover class so the appearance of this button changed I would like to apply this class of hover only when I hover my cursor over the element We'll add a mouse over event listener we will take my button add event listener we have an event type and a call back to a function the event type will be Mouse over when we Mouse over this element we are provided with an element object event Arrow do this we will access our event objects Target meaning the button take our class list and add the class of hover and let's see if this works if I hover my cursor over the button we apply the hover class now when I leave the button I would like to remove it really we can just copy the code for the event listener paste it replace Mouse over with mouse out then we will remove that class so now we can apply that class and then remove it with mouse over and mouse out there's also toggle if we toggle a class we'll remove it if that class is present add that class if it's not so let's replace add with toggle do this for both Mouse over and mouse out and that should work the same when we hover our cursor over the button we will toggle the class of hover if we have a mouse out event we will toggle it again to remove it now we're going to use the replace method to replace one class with another we'll create a new class of disabled we'll be replacing the enabled class with the disabled class when we click on the button so with the background color of the disabled class let's set the background color to be gray again I like using hsl for the colors I'll set the lightness to be like 60% I'm trying to get a faded appearance and for the color let's pick a light shade of gray using hsl values I'll set the lightness to be 80% going back to our Javascript file let's add the class of enabled my button access the class list use the add method we will add the class of enabled then we'll add an event listener to the button we will take my button add an event listener we have an event and a call back the event is going to be click I would like to do something when we click on the button we will receive an event Arrow do this take our events Target access the class list we will use the replace method replace the old class with the new class replace the enabled class with the disabled class there's two arguments the old class and the new class replace the old class with the new class then when we click on this button we'll replace the enabled class with the disabled class then we have the contains method if an element contains a class this will return true and if it doesn't it returns false So within our event listener let's add an if statement and an else statement we'll check to see if our events Target access the class list we will use the contains method if we click on the button and the class contains disabled what do we want to do does the class list contain disabled let's change the text content take our events Target access the text content all appended Emoji what's a good one that one else replace enable AED with disabled let's click on the button we'll replace the enabled class with the disabled class our button is now disabled if I were to inspect this element the class is now disabled if I were to click on this button again well our class contains disabled that was true so we end up doing this code where we appended the text content of the button now the nice thing about using class lists HTML elements have a class list property we can reuse CSS classes amongst many HTML elements we'll create an H1 element now the text of this element will be hello I will give this element a unique ID of my H1 I'll increase the font size so we can see it select the ID of my H1 I'll increase the font size let's try 5 RM let's create a reference to myh1 const myh1 equals document. getet element by ID the ID that I'm selecting is my H1 We'll add the enabled class to myh1 myh1 do classlist do add not ass add enabled and there we go we have added these CSS properties to this element and because I'm lazy I'm going to copy all this code where we add an event listener to my H1 so let's replace my button with my H1 now when we click on this H1 element we can disable it we'll replace the enabled class with the disabled class and if you don't believe me let's take a look the class of my H1 is now disabled if I were to click on this element again well the class list contains disabled so we execute this if statement where we change the text content of that Target now here's a challenge round we're going to create four buttons and store all of those buttons within a node list so let's create a button with the text of the first button being button one I will give this button a class of my buttons let's copy this button paste it three times button one button two button three button four let's remove the CSS for my H1 select the class of my buttons keep these three classes of enabled hover and disabled okay let's eliminate all this code we'll create a node list to contain all these buttons we can use const if we don't plan on adding or removing buttons or let if we do let buttons equals document. query selector all select all elements that have a class of my buttons we'll apply our enabled class to all the buttons so we will take our node list of buttons use the for each method for each button within our node list do this take each button access each button's class list property I will add a class of enabled and we have applied that class to all the buttons If you need to remove a class you can do the same but replace add with remove now when we hover our cursor over one of these buttons we will toggle the hover class we need to iterate through our node list of buttons take buttons use the build built in for each method for each button within our node list do this take each button add an event listener the event listener has an event type and a call back to a function the event type will be Mouse over when we hover a cursor over it we will be provided with an event argument Arrow do this access the event object access access the target meaning the button that we hover over access the class list property we will toggle the hover class so when we hover our cursor over one of these elements we will apply the hover class now when our cursor leaves one of these elements we would like to toggle that class again let's copy everything we have here paste it replace Mouse over with mouse out when we leave one of these elements toggle the hover class again to remove that class now when we click on one of the buttons we're going to replace the enabled class with the disabled class take our node list of buttons use the for each method with each button Arrow do this take each button add an event listener we need to select the event type and a call back to a function the event type is going to be click the parameter is event Arrow do this when we click on one of these buttons we'll replace the enabled class with the disabled class take our event object access its Target access the class list property we will replace replace the old class with the new class replace the enabled class with the disabled class and let's see if this works when I click on a button we'll replace the enabled class with the disabled class the last thing we'll do is that when we click on a button that's disabled we'll change the text content we'll have to use the contains method So within our event listener I'll add an if statement if access our event access its Target access the class list property use the contains method does the class list contain the class of disabled if it does we'll access our event access the target of that event change the text content of that element all append an emoji that one I like that emoji if the class list of that element isn't disabled it doesn't contain M the class of disabled we'll execute an El statement where we disable it by replacing the enabled class with the disabled class we have three event listeners Mouse over Mouse out and click we're utilizing all three of these custom classes enabled hover and disabled we can hover over these elements then we'll have Mouse over and mouse out events then when I click on one of these buttons we can apply that disabled class within our click event listener we have an if statement if we click on an element that's already disabled append the text content all right everybody so that is the class list property it's used to interact with an element's list of classes their CSS classes they allow you to make reusable classes for many elements across your web page and well everybody that is the class list property in JavaScript
q32skvBgxo4,Learn JavaScript KEY EVENTS in 10+ minutes! ⌨,2023-12-14T14:46:31Z,hey what's going on everybody in today's video I'm going to give you an introduction to key events in JavaScript so sit back relax and enjoy the show so what we've discussed in the previous topic is event listeners an event listener can be added to an HTML element they will listen for specific events to create interactive web pages we'll be discussing key down and key up there is a third type of key event called key press however according to the official documentation this event is incompatible with all web browsers so you should avoid using key press a key down event occurs when you press down on a key a key up event occurs when you release a key by adding an event listener to the Dom document we can detect when we press down or release a key here's how we will access our Dom then add an event listener add event listener we have two arguments the event type and a call back when we press down on a key let's do something doesn't matter what key it is any key for this next argument I can either pass in a call back an anonymous function or an arrow function I like Arrow functions so I'm going to use an arrow function we're provided with an event parameter when something happens within our web browser an event object is created we can access it so I'm going to console.log this event object and we'll see the details of it be sure to select your web browser I'm going to press the q key then let's go to inspect console and here's that event the web browser provided us with a keyboard event the key pressed was Q there's a relevant key code of 81 and there's other properties too like was the ALT key being held down at the time it wasn't same thing with the shift key and the target which is the body of our document I'm going to Output the key prop property of the event we'll press a different key I'm going to hold down the F key I'm not releasing it I'm holding it down we're going to consistently fire key down events I would like to detect when I release a key I will use the key up event so let's copy this paste it the event is going to be key up I'll display something else I'm going to use a template string I will display key down equals then I will display this events key let's do this with key up too I'll just copy this key up equals event. key let's go back to our console I'm going to hold down the S key then when I release it we'll have a key up event key up equals s oh one more important thing the arrow keys we have Arrow up arrow down arrow left and arrow right if you ever would like to make some sort of game the arrow keys are also accessible now what we'll do on key down and key up is change an HTML element so to make this simple within our HTML document I'm going to create a div element this div element will have an ID of my box I'll add some text an emoji all right all right let's add a little bit of CSS we will select my box I will set the background color to be light blue we haven't picked light blue yet I will set a width of 200 pixels a height of 200 pixels a font size of 7.5 RM I'll use flex box display Flex justify content Center aine item Center this part is important for the next exercise we are going to set the position to relative for relative positioning I'll set the body of my document to have no margin margin zero all right we are ready we are going to select the ID of my box const my box equals document. getet element by ID the ID that I'm going to select is my box when I press a key down I'm going to change the text content of my box mybox do text content equals I'll pick a different Emoji let's do that one and I'll change the CSS my box. style do background color equals tomato or some other color of you're choosing so when I press down on any key the HTML and CSS is going to change I'm going to release that key but we don't revert back to normal our HTML element stays that way what we'll do is that when we release a key we'll revert these changes by going back to the origin so let's take my box change the text content to equal an emoji because I like emojis we'll use the original one then I will set the background color to be light blue now if I were to hold down a button the HTML and CSS is going to change until I release that button which I am about to now in 3 2 1 go I'm going to try and press the space bars fast fast as I can seizure warning let's go okay it's about time we move on what we're going to do now is using the arrow keys move this element we're going to create a const of move amount when pressing an arrow key how far do we want to move this element let's say 10 for 10 pixels I will create a variable for X think of these as coordinates I will set that to be zero and y y will also be zero X for any horizontal movement and Y for any vertical movement document. addevent listener when we have a key down event I would like to do something I'll write an arrow function we're provided with an event do all this code I only want to do something if a user uses an arrow key so if I was to console.log my event then access the key property let's go to inspect console select your document I would like to do something only if the key pressed is Arrow up arrow down arrow left or Arrow right I don't want any of the other keys I can write this if statement if access our event access its key follow this with the starts with method does this key start with arrow we'll only enter the SI statement if the key of the event is Arrow up arrow down arrow left or Arrow right then we'll write a switch we haven't written any switches for a while we will examine the key of our event with switches we examine a value against matching cases if we have a case of Arrow up if the key of our event matches the case of of Arrow up then do this we'll take our y-coordinate subtract our movement amount which is 10 Yus equals the movement amount and then be sure to break to break out of the switch then we need a case for arrow down arrow down y + equals our movement amount Arrow left Arrow left X for the horizontal axis minus equals the movement amount and then Arrow right arrow right X plus equals the movement amount then outside of the switch but within our if statement we're going to access my box access the style access the top property set it equal to a template string we're going to take our variable of Y for the y coordinate then add pixels take the top property of my box set it equal to the y-coordinate we're going to copy this and do this with the left property set it equal to X in pixels be sure to select the body of your document we can move right with the right arrow key down left and up or diagonal if I hit two keys at once the arrow keys have a default Behavior to scroll you can see that if we go down too far we have a scroll bar on the right hand side we can prevent the default behavior of a key we just have to add this line of code take our event then follow it with the prevent default method so when my element Scrolls off screen it'll disappear we're not going to scroll with it to increase the distance in which this element moves we can increase the move amount let's set it to be 100 now we're moving a lot further with each key press hey this is bro from the future there's one more thing I would like to add to this project when pressing down on a key let's change the text content and the background color much like what we did with the first exercise then when we release a key we'll revert the HTML and the CSS back to normal we're combining the first exercise and the second one and this is the result when I move the arrow keys this guy is going to freak out until I Let Go pretty exciting all right everybody so that is an introduction to key events in JavaScript you're going to add an event listener to the document when you select your document and press a key when the key is pressed down that will create a key down event when you release a key that creates a key up event and well everybody that is an introduction to key events in JavaScript
WCRi7y6aNrQ,How to ADD/CHANGE HTML using JavaScript 🛠️,2023-12-11T19:41:36Z,hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can add and change HTML elements using JavaScript so sit back relax and enjoy the show I'll break down creating and appending elements to the Dom in three simple steps we'll create the element add any necessary attributes or properties and then append the element to the Dom will be the final step but before we do begin within our HTML file we'll create a few boxes for this exercise these will be developments with an inner paragraph the first will have text of box one with this development I will give it an ID of box one and a class of box let's copy this developement paste it three times for a total of four boxes we'll create box two box three and box four I'll apply the following CSS properties we're selecting the Box class add a border of 3 pixel solid set a width to be 100% and a height of 125 pixels and we are ready to begin step one we need to create the element in order to work with it right I will create a constant of new H1 H1 equals we will select our document use the create element method then as a string pass in the type of the element we would like to create we'll create an H1 element we now have an H1 element to work with which we're referencing as new H1 let's add some attributes and CSS properties let's do one for now I will take my new H1 element access its text content set it equal to I like pizza and then we just have to append this element to the Dom to do that we will access our Dom with document what element would we like to select let's select the body element of our document and then we will use the append method pass in our HTML element as an argument and there we go there's our H1 element when you append an element to a parent this new element is the last child you could prepend if you would like it to be the first child so let's use the prepend method change aend to prepend and it's now at the beginning let's add an additional attribute we will take our new H1 element set the ID attribute equal to my H1 and let's see if that worked I will right click on this element inspect it here's our H1 element it's the first child because we're prepending it this H1 element has an ID attribute set to my H1 let's change the CSS properties of this element I will access new H1 access its style access its color the font color let's set it to be red but better yet let's set the color to be tomato because I like tomatoes I think that's a better looking shade of red let's also Center the text new H1 access its style access the text align property set it to be Center and the text is now centered when I append this element I would like to append it to within box one I will select box one as the parent rather than the body we will access our document we need to select an element we will select box one we could use document. getet element by ID the ID that I'm going to select is box one I will then follow this with append append our new H1 element so our H1 element is now within box one and not outside of it like it was previously I could append this H1 element to box two but I would have to select it we will get element by ID select box two to put it within box two box three and box four when I'm appending this element to box one it is the last child of box one if there are any child elements within this box which there is we have a paragraph element that H1 element will come after and not before so if you would like this H1 element to be the first child we can prepend it I'm going to copy this because I don't want to rewrite it we will prepend prepend my new H1 element take box one prepend the new H1 element so my H1 element is now at the top it's the first child the paragraph element comes after let's do this with box two box three and box 4 what if we would like to take our H1 element and sandwich it between box one and box two I could select box two and insert that new H1 element before it here's how I will create a reference to Box 2 equals document. get element by ID we will select the ID of box two access our document access the body because box two is a child element of the body use the insert before method there's two arguments the new element and the current element element the new element is going to be new H1 that's what we're trying to add the current element is the target we're selecting box two insert the new H1 element before box two and this is what that looks like this H1 element is now between box one and box two take the new H1 element insert it before Box 2 if we were to do this with box one well then it's going to be before box one let's try this with box 3 our H1 element is before box 3 and box 4 what if these elements don't have IDs how do we select them then here's how we will use Query selector all to select everything that has the Box class I will create a constant of boxes this will be a node the list access our document use Query selector all select everything that has a box class we will use the insert before method access our document access the body insert before we have the new element to add and the current element the new element is new H1 the current element is our node list of boxes we can access a specific element from this node list with an index if I accessed boxes at index zero that would give me box one boxes at index one that's referring to box two box three and box four so you could use Query selector to select many elements store it within a node list then select those specific elements with an index number this is optional but at any time if you need to remove an HTML element here's how let's append our new H1 element we need to select the location in which we can find that element it's within the body of our document document dot body use the remove child method we will remove our new H1 element and it's gone what if this H1 element was within box one all right I will append our new H1 element to box one and we need to add the IDS back to these boxes because I forgot to do that we're pending our new H1 element to box one when I try and remove it it doesn't work it's still there we need to select box one and not the body of our document because box one is the direct parent of our H1 element not the body the body in this case could be like the grandparent instead of selecting our body we will get the ID of box one or some other element selector to get box one I'll use get element by ID because it's easy get element by ID the ID that I'm selecting is box one remove the new H1 element that's found within it and it's gone if at any time you need to remove an element select the parent of that element then follow it with the remove child method pass in the element you're trying to remove as an argument in this last example we're going to work with ordered lists so going to our HTML file we will create an ordered list with a pair of O tags I will give this ordered list an ID of fruits We'll add a few list items the first list item will be for an apple the ID will be apple we'll create a list item element for an or orange ID will be orange and a banana ID banana I'll add a little bit of CSS styling going to the CSS stylesheet I will select the ID of fruits I'll add a border of three pixel solid for this demonstration and increase the font size to 2 RM all right and that's what we need to work with we'll now be creating a list item element I will create a constant of new list item equals document. create element what is the type of element we're trying to create a list item element let's set any attributes or properties that's step two let's take our new list item set the text content to equal coconut we'll append this element if I were to append this new list item to the body of my document it's the last child of the body we're not adding it to this ordered list now that we can see it I'm going to add a few more attributes and properties let's take our new list item access its ID attribute set it to be coconut let's change the font weight new list item access the style access the font weight set it to be bold and the background color access the style access the background color I'll set the background color to be light green we have our list item element if I append it to the bot body it's now the last child of the body of my document not this ordered list found within the body if I were to prepend it this is what would happen prepend the new list item it's now the first child now we'll select our ordered list of fruits get element by ID fruits append the new list item and it's now at the end at number four let's let prepend to the ordered list get element by ID fruits prepend our new list item our coconut is now at number one how can we insert our coconut between Apple and Orange here's how since these list item elements have an ID I could use that let's get the ID of orange const orange get element by ID orange instead of selecting the body we're going to select the ordered list that has an ID of fruits document. getet element by ID the ID that I'm selecting is fruits select the ordered list of fruits insert the new list item before the orange our coconut is now at number two let's insert the coconut before the banana the ID was banana const banana insert the new list item before the banana our coconut is now at number three you could insert before Apple too I will get the ID of apple const apple insert the new list item before the apple and it's back at the beginning what if these list items don't have ideas let's eliminate those we would need to use Query selector to select all list items from the ordered list of roots so I'm going to use Query selector all select the ID of fruits then select any list item descendants within this ID this will return a node list that stores all of the current list items within this ordered list we need to select our ordered list of fruits not the body document. getet element by ID I will select our ordered list of fruits insert the new list item before list items at index zero now will'll insert the coconut before the Apple let's increment our index to one our coconut is now before the orange now it's before the banana and now it's after the banana if I need to remove this list item I would need to select it first so let's append the new list item to fruits I will get the ID of the ordered list of fruits remove the child of new list item and it's now gone all right everybody so that is how we can add change and remove HTML elements using JavaScript
Y62mbztjmus,React JS update ARRAY of OBJECTS in state 🚘,2023-12-10T12:58:48Z,hey everybody in today's video I'm going to show you how we can update the state of an array of objects if you're able to comprehend this lesson and you've watched previous topics we'll be ready to make a few projects in react so let's get started like we've done in Prior lessons be sure to import the UST State hook in this topic we're not going to create one state variable but four const cars cars is going to be an array of objects then we need a Setter for our array of cars equals use state I'm going to set the initial state to be an empty array then we will create a state variable for the cars year and a Setter for car year use state if we're going to be adding car objects to make it easier for me I could set the initial state to be a year like 2024 something that's kind of recent but I think it would be a lot cooler if we use JavaScript to get the current year right now I'm filming this video in December 2023 for the initial state I'm going to create a new date object then get the full year method for me this is going to return 2023 but depending on when you're watching this video it might be later we'll create a state variable for our cars make who manufactured the car set car make equals use State I will set the initial state to be an empty string then we need the model I'll just copy this because I'm lazy change make to be model set car model the initial State for the model will be a string all right now we're going to declare all the functions we'll need throughout this application we'll create a function to add a car remove a car change the year change the make change the model five functions total we'll declare a function to handle add car then a function to handle remove car there is one parameter an index what is the index of the object that we're removing from this array we need a Handler for year make and model function handle year change there is one parameter an event that will be provided to us through the onchange event handler we need a function to handle make change handle make change and handle model change so we should have five functions total add car remove car change the year change the make change the model let's create our HTML elements So within our return statement I will create a div to enclose everything let's create an H2 element for a heading list of car objects afterwards I will create an unordered list we will populate this unordered list later we will create three input elements for the year the make and the model of our car that we're trying to add we will begin with input that has a type of number I will set the value to equal the state of car year and for me that's 2023 that's because I'm creating a date object of the current date and time then returning the the year depending on what year you're watching this it might be different I will set the onchange event handler equal to a call back to handle year change I'll add a break afterwards okay let's copy this input element including the break the type of the second input element will be text the value will be the cars make who made the car the on change event handler will be a call back to handle make change we should add a placeholder to tell the user what we want them to type in it's not very apparent I'll put this on a new line for readability I will set the placeholder attribute equal to enter car make let's copy this element paste it for the third input element the value will be car model the onchange event handler will be a callback to handle model change the placeholder will be enter car model then we'll create a button to submit our car object button the text on the button will be add car we will set the onclick event handler equal to handle Adar all right now we have to fill in these functions we'll begin with handle year change because it's easy we will use the setter for set car Year we will pass in Access our event object that's provided to us access its Target access its value then we have to do this with make and model set car make access the value of the target of the event pass it as an argument set car model again take our event access its Target access its value so now we should be able to update these values let's try it when I click on the button I would like to add this object to my array of objects within our handle Adar function we have a few things to write it's not as complicated as what you think it might be using these State variables of year making model we will create a new car const new car equals a JavaScript object with these properties the year will equal the current state of car year the make will equal the current state of car make the model will equal the current state of car model then just for readability I'm going to put all these properties on a new line not necessary but but I find it easier to read we will use the setter for our array of car objects we will use an updator function we will take cars Arrow create a new array use the spread operator on cars we need to copy the previous elements over to the new array we don't want to lose them then we will add a new element our new car object so we don't want to use the current state of cars but rather the previous state with this updator function a common naming convention for your parameter is to use the first letter of that state variable let's rename cars as C so what we're going to do now is go to our unordered list we need to populate it with list items I will embed some JavaScript take our array of cars use the built-in map method to return a new array we're providing with two arguments an element and an index with the map method but I'm going to rename element as car so it's more understandable what would we like to do I'll use an arrow function we will return a list item element and for readability I'm just going to place these on a new line react wants us to add a key to each list item element so let's take care of that I will set the key of each list item element to be our index that's provided to us within each list item element I will display the cars year followed by The Cars make and the cars model all right let's see if this works let's add a 2023 Ford Mustang and that worked how about a 2024 Chevrolet Corvette and and a 2022 Dodge Challenger one thing I'm going to add to the handle Adar function after submitting a car I would like to reset these values at the end of this function let's use the Setters I will set the car year when we're done with it to be the current year we'll create a new date object get the full year update the state to whatever values turned we'll use the setter for the car make and reset it to be an empty string same thing with the car model all right let's see if this resets 2023 Ford Mustang and it does 2025 Chevrolet Camaro and that does reset you can see that my year went back to 2023 even though I adjusted it to 2025 the make and model were both replaced with empty strings now I would like to remove a car when I click on one of these list item elements we make one change to the opening list item tag I will set the onclick event handler to a callback to handle remove car we do have to pass in an argument though to the function we have to pass in an index what is the index of the car we're trying to remove if I attempt to pass in an argument we will call this function right away we will convert this call back to an arrow function that has no parameters So within the handle remove car function there's not a lot to write we will use the setter for our cars we'll use an updator function we don't want to use cars but we'll use the first letter to indicate we're working with the previous state arrow take the previous state of our array of cars represented as C use the built-in filter method we will filter any cars that don't meet a certain criteria the filter method provides us with an element and an index but we do have a naming conflict we already have a parameter with the name of index let's rename the index of each element within our array as I then do this with an arrow function we'll write our condition check to see if the index of the current element I is not strictly equal to the index we would like to remove we'll filter out that element when we create a new array so we're not working with the current element even though it's provided to us so what people do is a convention if you have a parameter you're not using people will change the name of that parameter to be an underscore that tells other people to ignore this parameter and that should work let's run and test everything let's add a 2023 for Mustang but feel free to pick some different cars 2024 chevret Corvette 2022 Dodge Challenger and I should be able to remove a car when I click on it that list item element our Corvette is gone our Mustang and our challenger all right everybody so that is how to create an array of objects and update their state using react
nbAaUpNDhRY,What are React updater functions? 🔄,2023-12-08T16:15:36Z,yo what's going on everybody so in today's video I got to explain updator functions in react an updator function is a function passed as an argument to set State usually for example I have a Setter function for a year if I need to increment my year by one I would just add plus one to year this does in fact work but a better practice would be to pass in an updator function as an argument usually this is represented as an arrow function by passing in an updator function this allows for safe updates based on the previous state you typically see updator functions used with multiple State updates and asynchronous functions it is a good practice to use updator functions whenever possible so in this basic example I've made a counter program we can increment count decrement count and reset count within each of these functions I'm taking my state variable of count adding + one minus one or setting count to equal Z in the case of reset I don't want to increment once I would like to increment twice I will take set count update the state again using count + one this is different for me adding two to count I want to increment count by one twice I will set the state of count twice count + one then count + one if I attempt to run this I will increment count twice with every button click however our count only increases by one during each button click I'm very persistent let's try and set count again because you know the first two times didn't work during each button click I would like to increment count by one three times but we're still only updating by one still here's the reason why we're using the current state of count to calculate the next state after using a Setter function this doesn't trigger an update react batches together updates for performance reasons you would imagine that after these functions we would update but that's not necessarily the case using react we batch together these State updates for performance reasons in reality it's going to look something like this we're taking count which is zero adding one to it count didn't update yet it's still zero add one to it take count which is still zero because we didn't update add one to it in reality what we're doing is setting count to be one three separate times and then updating this would be similar to me hitting the refresh button on my web browser a bunch of times we've sent a bunch of commands to refresh the web browser but we may only end up refreshing once not each time I click the button that's because our web browser has its own event Loop cycle that's a similar way of thinking about it if for some reason you need to use multiple State updates you'll want to use an updator function here's how we're going to write a function our function has one parameter count in this case Arrow then do this let's write an arrow function for each set count so this will work however you'll want to rename count to be something else we're going to be working with the previous state of count not the current state we're using the previous state of count to calculate the next state according to the react documents you'll want to rename count as either something like previous count such as this or you can take the first letter of the state variable in this case C I find taking the first letter of the state variable much more easier to read it's less ver Bose so this will work then when I press the increment button we're updating the state three separate times C represents the previous count not the current count with our updator function we're taking the pending state to calculate the next state not the current state we don't update until later when we pass in an updator function we're adding all of these updator functions to a q a q is a type of data structure a q is similar to a bunch of people waiting in line it's first come first serve the first person in line is going to be helped first so during the next render it will call all of these functions in order rather than batch them all together when using multiple State updates you'll want to be sure to use updator functions it is good practice whenever possible to use updator functions just for consistency even if you're only going to up update the state once it would still be good practice to use an updater function it will help future proof your code in case you ever need to update the state again so now let's take our decrement function currently we're updating the current state of count not the previous state let's begin by setting up a parameter of count Arrow then do this but we'll want to be sure to rename count just to show that we're working with the previous state not the current state let's rename count as the first letter of the state variable which is c c arrow take C minus one let's do this two additional times now when we increment we will increment three separate times and we can decrement three separate times now last we have reset with the setter function we're not dependent on the previous state all we're doing is setting count to be zero if I was going to use use an updator function it would look like this C Arrow C equals z we really don't care about the previous state this would still technically work we don't really need our count for anything we're setting c equal to zero because by passing in zero we're already sending it to be zero in this specific example an updator function wouldn't be necessary because we don't need the previous state all right everybody so those are updator functions it's a function passed as an argument to set State usually when updating a state variable you'll pass in an arrow function if we were working with a state variable of year I would pass in an arrow function that looked like this we have a parameter of Y Arrow let's take y + one if I was incrementing our year by one in this case by using updator functions they allow for safe updates based on the previous state not the current state this allows for multiple State updates and is used with with asynchronous functions it's a good practice to use updat functions whenever possible we will be using updator functions in the future and well everybody those are updator functions in react
Coyy79wRz_s,What is asynchronous JavaScript code? 💤,2023-11-30T15:39:07Z,"Yo, what's going on people? So, in today's video, I got to explain what asynchronous code is in JavaScript. Synchronous is code that executes line by line consecutively in a sequential manner. Synchronous code waits for an operation to complete. For example, if I were to use console.log. Let's pretend we're performing some task. It doesn't matter what the task is. We will pretend that task one is complete. Then we'll move on to task two, then task three. All this code is synchronous. We're executing this code line by line. We can't move on to task two until we complete task one. There is an order of events that we need to follow. It's code that waits for an operation to complete. Now, on the other hand, asynchronous code allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently without waiting. Asynchronous code doesn't block the execution flow and allows the program to continue. Imagine that asynchronous code is kind of like a time traveler. A time traveler can move out of the flow of time, but the rest of the world continues. Time resumes normally. Asynchronous code doesn't block the execution flow. Time moves on with or without it. Asynchronous code is typically found with input output operations, network requests, and fetching data. Anything that could take an indeterminate amount of time. So for example, I will use the set timeout function. After 3 seconds, I will execute a function. Let's console.log. Let's say task one. We'll change these three lines to be task two, task three, task 4. I will finish task one after 3,000 milliseconds. Now check this out. We've already completed task 2, three, and four, but task one finished last. That's because set timeout is one of many asynchronous functions. The rest of the program isn't going to wait around for it to complete. It runs concurrently with the rest of my code. That's why task one was completed at the end and not at the beginning. There's different ways to handle asynchronous code. We're already familiar with callbacks, but there's also promises as well as a sync and await. We still need to discuss these topics in the future, but we're already familiar with callbacks. If it's crucial that task 2 through 4 finishes after task one, we can use a callback. We don't necessarily know how long this asynchronous function is going to take. What we could do in this example is create a function function. Funk one meaning function one. I will execute this code within function one. Then we will accept a callback as an argument. Then we'll have function funk 2 to do some synchronous code. Function two will have tasks two through four. After task one is complete, I will invoke my call back to function two. So with an arrow function, I have more than one line of code. I need to add a set of curly braces. After task one, I will invoke that call back. So then if I call function one, I have to pass a call back to function two. So now function one is asynchronous. But I need this synchronous code to execute after task one is complete. And now that should work. 1 2 3. There it is. We have task one which is asynchronous followed by task two, task three and task four. So by using callbacks that's one way in which we can handle asynchronous code. But we still need to discuss promises async and a wait which are future topics. All right everybody. So that is what asynchronous code is. Synchronous code executes line by line consecutively in a sequential manner. Asynchronous code allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently without waiting. Asynchronous code doesn't block the execution flow and allows the rest of the program to continue. Asynchronous code is commonly found with input output operations, network requests, and fetching data. Usually anything that takes an indeterminate amount of time. And well everybody, that's what asynchronous code is in JavaScript."
HOMu48bTzz8,Format currency EASY in JavaScript 💲,2023-11-28T14:45:37Z,hey what's going on everybody so in today's video I'm going to show you a few ways in which we can format currency in JavaScript it involves this pretty sweet method the two local string method basically what this method does is that it returns a string with a language sensitive representation of a number depending on which country you're in you format numbers a different way for example I'm in the United States we separate every thousand's place with a comma then follow any decimal numbers on the right hand side however if you were in let's say Germany you would format it this way personally I have no idea how to read this number sorry Germany representing numbers to a foreign audience is fairly important because honestly if I saw this number it would confuse me now in today's video we're going to be covering the two local string method another way to format currency is with international number format but that's a little Advanced for us once you're at the intermediate or advanced level I would definitely take a look at international number format but that will be outside the scope of today's lesson the two local string method is a simple and beginner friendly way to format currency and other numbers so you have a number numbers have a built-in two local string method the first argument is a string representation of a location a local it specifies the language to use if you set this to be undefined you'll use the default set in the viewer's browser that's a good option for the second argument you can send an object an object of formatting options I'll give you an example let's say we have a number let number equal 1 2 3 4 5 6 789 to format this number I will take our number reassign it equal to number use the builtin to local string method we have two arguments a string location and an object let's start with the string location for a United States local that would be n for english-us Capital then we should display our number console.log number yep and there is United States formatting let's pass in a string local for India again following the same format we will change the location to be hi for Hindi Das I in based on that geographic location there's different number formatting let's cover Germany D- capital de to use the viewer's default set for the browser you're going to pass in undefined so I will pass in undefined for me personally that will give me the United States formatting now you can pass in options we can can take this number with this formatting and give it a unit of currency so again we're going to reassign our number number equals number use the built-in to local string method my location will be the United States feel free to pick a different one if you would like the second argument is going to be an object we need to set a curly braces to represent an object objects can have properties properties that hold values if you need currency you will set the style property you'll set the style property to have a string value of currency the next property would be currency colon I'm going to zoom out a little bit for United States dollars that would be USD and let's see what we have there we go we have American dollars with United States number formatting let's do this with Indian rupees so again number equals number to local string the local will be hi- I comma for the next argument we're passing in an object I'm going to zoom in again the style property will be currency We'll add another property this property will be currency colon space for rupes that would be I NR and here is our new number with different currency formatting okay then I think Germany uses zos number equals number to local string what's the location Germany that would be d-de Capital comma space the next argument is an object the style property will be currency the next property will be currency and the currency is going to be EU for euros and that has appeared to work all right everybody so that is a beginner friendly way in which you can format currency in JavaScript
2glfqa-ZbNw,Build this digital clock with JavaScript! 🕐,2023-11-27T15:27:40Z,"hey what's going on people so in today's video we're going to create a digital clock using JavaScript HTML and CSS so let's get started the HTML for this project is going to be very minimal I will create a development the ID of the develop will be clock Das container within this development we'll have a nested development with an ID of clock we have a clock within a clock container as a placeholder temporar ly the text on the clock will be 0 0 colon 0 0 colon 0 0 00000000 and I'm just going to zoom in temporarily and that is all the HTML that we need let's head to our CSS stylesheet let's begin with the body I will set all margin to be zero originally let's select our clock container ID clock container I'll use flex box for the clock container display Flex I will justify content in the center justify content Center if you would also like to vertically align you'll need to add the following two lines of code I will align items Center this CSS property will vertically align elements but the clock container itself is kind of small for example I'll add a border of two pixel solid the elements within the clock container are aligned both horizontally and vertically but the container itself is kind of small to vertically align this element within the window itself we'll have to increase the height of the clock container I will add height of 100 VH for the viewport height and we can remove the Border yep the clock is now within the middle of the container both horizontally and vertically but if you prefer to be at the top you can eliminate these last two lines it's up to you let's style the clock itself we are selecting the ID of clock I will change the font family to be monospace this is the normal size when I'm zoomed in to 100% I will set the font size to be 6.5 R then set the font weight to be bold and text align Center if you would like a background image for the body of your document I just so happen to have one right here it's a picture of Central Park in New York this is optional but if you would like to include a background image of this project within your CSS stylesheet you'll add the following CSS properties I will set the background image property to be a URL so what is the name of that image I'm going to copy the name of it and paste it within this URL function I'll set the background position to be the center right now we're seeing the top left of the image instead of the center background Position will be Center if you're using a small image your image might be repeating itself to take up all the available space to prevent that you can set the background repeat property to be no repeat mine already wasn't repeating though but yours might be then we'll set the background size to cover by adding this property this image will cover the entire window and maintain its aspect ratio if you do have additional content besides this clock you can keep the background in place when you scroll down by adding this property background attachment to be fixed this property isn't going to be apparent because we don't have a scroll bar but if you did have a scroll bar the background will stay in place at least let's head back to our clock element I will change the color the font color to be white if you would like a background blur effect you'll add this property we'll set the backdrop filter property to be a blur function the greater the number the more blur effect you're going to have so this is 5 pixels if I were to increase this to 50 well well there's a lot of blur then I'll set my blur to be five I would just like a little bit as if we're looking through glass I'll increase the width to be 100% to take up 100% of the width of the web browser width 100% to give this glass look a foggy appearance we can add a background color that's slightly gray background- color let's select gray but I like using us hsl values so for the lightness I'll set it to be 100% but I'm going to lower the alpha down to like 10% now the background has a foggy glass appearance if you were to increase the amount of alpha that'll increase the lightness I'll keep mine as 10% 0.1 for the alpha all right now we just need to get this clock to run so let's save everything go to our Javascript file we will create a function to update our clock immediately when we begin this program we will update our clock once immediately now we need to get the current time let's declare a constant of now what is the time right now this will be a new date object to get the hour we will say const hours equals use the builtin get hours method then let's do this with minutes const minutes equals now. getet minutes method and seconds const seconds equals now. get seconds I'm going to change the text content of the clock to be a time string it will be a template string how do we want to arrange our numbers const time string equals a template string first we'll add a placeholder for our hours colon minutes colon seconds then we will select the ID of clock document. getet element by ID the ID that we're getting is our clock change the text content to equal our time string when we save the time on the clock should update currently for me it's 8:00 for each of these placeholders for hours minutes and seconds I would like each to take up two digits We'll add some zeros for padding for example this time will be 08 006 there's a built-in string method for that so with hours minutes and seconds we will convert these to Strings we'll use method chaining then add to string do this for hours minutes and seconds with strings there's a pad start method for the first two characters pad them with a zero let's copy this method and paste it for minutes and seconds now when I save and update the time we have zero padding 08 01 54 in this case to get this clock to update every second we'll follow update clock with the set interval function set interval works like set timeout except it will call a function repeatedly not just once but we need a call back the Callback will be update clock call this function after every 1,000 milliseconds and now our clock should run currently this clock is in military time although I'm recording this at 8:00 in the morning if you would like this clock to be a 12-hour clock then at a.m or p.m. here's the following changes we're going to make we'll declare ours with let instead of const so we can change it and reassign it we'll create a new constant of meridium 4 a.m. or p.m. this will equal hours is hours greater than or equal to 12 we'll use the erary operator to check this if ours is greater than or equal to 12 meridium will be PM otherwise it will be am then after our meridium we'll reassign hours hours equals hours modulus modulus gives you the remainder of any division ours modul 12 if this is zero we'll use the or logical operator or 12 after seconds we'll add a placeholder for our meridium currently we lost our padding for the hours so we're going to cut this part of our code to convert ours to a string and Pad it we'll take hours equals hours to reassign it follow hours with converting it to a string using the two string method and Pad it before displaying it all right and that has appeared to work all right everybody so that is a digital clock program you can make using HTML CSS and JavaScript"
CTHhlx25X-U,Learn JavaScript SORTING in 6 minutes! 🗃,2023-11-22T16:13:12Z,yo so uh what's up today I'm going to be talking about the sort method in JavaScript the sort method is used to sort elements of an array in place however with the sort method we sort elements as strings in lexicographic order not alphabetical if I could summarize what lexicographic means it means alphabet Plus numbers plus symbols as strings let me give you an example with just alphabetical characters I have an array of fruits to sort this array I can take the array name fruits use the built-in sort method then console.log my array of fruits let me expand this and here's my array all sorted when sorting we treat any elements as strings what if my array were numbers I'll add the numbers 1 through 10 in a somewhat random order let's change our array to be numbers numbers. sort console.log numbers here's the result we have one then 10 then the rest seem to be in order we're not sorting this array numerically we're sorting this array lexor graphically we're treating each of these numbers as strings that's why we have one then 10 10 isn't at the end where we expect it would be there's a couple extra steps we need to do involving sorting numbers inside of the sort method we have to write a custom comparison function this is normally a callback but you can write a function expression or even better yet an arrow function we'll write an arrow function in this case let me zoom in with an arrow function we first need parameters we'll have parameters A and B we'll examine two contiguous elements 1 then 10 10 then 2 two then nine N9 and three so on and so forth then we need an arrow then we'll write a minus B our function a minus B will return either a0 or positive value depending on what values we're examining the sort method will sort those values into place depending on what the value returned is our array should be sorted you can see that 10 is at the end instead of right after one for reverse order you could say B minus a now we're starting with 10 and ending with one you can even sort objects by a given property let's go over that example we will create an array of people const people equals this will be an array will include four objects all comma separated the first will have a name property of SpongeBob age 30 and a GPA GPA 3.0 I'm going to zoom out for the next object just going to put that on a new line let's copy all these properties change name to be Patrick age will be 37 GPA 1.5 again for the next object we will have Squidward age 51 GPA 2.5 then lastly we'll have Sandy name Sandy let's make Sandy 27 GPA of course it's going to be a 4.0 I would like to sort this array of objects by each person's age we'll take our array of objects that's stored within people use the built-in sort method use our Arrow function a comma B Arrow we'll take parameter a that's person one do access their age property minus parameter B access their age property and that's all you got to do now let's console.log R people there we are we have Sandy who's the youngest then SpongeBob Patrick Squidward for reverse order you'll just change a to be B and B to be a Squidward Patrick SpongeBob Sandy or we can sort by a different property let's do GPA this time a. GPA b. GPA we have Patrick with the lowest GPA followed by Squidward SpongeBob Sandy then reverse order would be b. GPA minus a. GPA Sandy SpongeBob Squidward Patrick let's try sorting by the name property and see what happens a.name minus b.n name we have SpongeBob Patrick's Squidward Sandy but that doesn't seem to make sense these aren't in alphabetical order if you need to sort by a property that contains a string within an object there's a different formula we will take a.name do use the built-in local compare method compare to b. name this method will examine two strings for lexicographic order now these are all arranged lexicographically starting with Patrick then Sandy SpongeBob Squidward for reverse lexicographic order we would take b.n name. local compare then examine a.name I've just now realized that there's a lot of SpongeBob characters whose first name starts with an S like we have three right here Squidward SpongeBob Sandy Patrick all right everybody so that is the sort method it's used to sort elements of an array in place it sorts elements as strings in lexicographic order not alphabetical and well everybody that is the sort method in JavaScript
b8gwYQ_V4K4,Learn JavaScript NESTED OBJECTS easy! 📫,2023-11-21T16:15:53Z,so uh yeah we're doing a thing today today I got to explain nested objects in JavaScript nested objects are objects inside of other objects they allow you to represent more complex data structures a child object is enclosed by a parent object by using nested objects we have the capability of creating some very complex data structures for example a person object could contain an address object as well as a contact info object or a shopping cart object each item in your shopping cart is an individual object such as a keyboard a mouse or a monitor each of these child objects would have their own properties and methods for example a price a name specifications on the item a shipping method nested objects are just objects inside of other objects let me give you a basic example we'll create a person object const person equals an object we need a set of curly braces a person might have a full name property I will set that to be SpongeBob in this example SpongeBob SquarePants and age of 30 is SpongeBob a student is student he's in boating school so let's say that's true objects can also contain arrays we'll create an array of hobbies to declare an array you need to set a straight brackets what sorts of hobbies does SpongeBob have he knows karate he does jellyfishing I need one more uh let's say that he enjoys cooking now we're going to create a nested object this person object will have an address object so we need a set of curly braces a few of the properties of the inner address object could be a street SpongeBob has an address of 124 con Street his City will be bikini bottom and a country we won't do a full address but I think this is good enough for this example so SpongeBob lives in the ocean let's say that his country is international waters I'll just abbreviate International our person object has a nested address object inside of it taxes some of these properties of our person object we would type the name of the object use the property accessor which is dot then the name of the property full name SpongeBob SquarePants let's print his age 30 is SpongeBob a student that is true I'm going to display the array of hobbies person. Hobbies this will give you an array but if you need individual elements you have to list an index number so Hobbies at index zero would be karate one is jellyfishing index two is cooking let's console.log our person object dot the address object this would return an entire object if you need one of the properties within this object that's within the person object you would have to follow the inner object with the property accessor again that dot person. address. Street which would give you 124 con Street the city person. address. city Bikini Bottom person. address. country international waters so when accessing a property within a nested object you have to use the property accessor twice that dot if you would like to Loop through the properties of a nested object you can write a for Loop like this for const property in person. address console.log take our person object access the nested object address then use the index of operator the straight brackets give me the current property and there we are all right let's make something a little more complicated we're going to create a class that utilizes objects so we will begin with class address our class will have a Constructor for an address we need these three things feel free to add more if you would like a street City and Country then we'll assign these properties this. Street equals Street this. City equals City this. Country equals country now we'll create a person class class person our person class will also have a Constructor we'll need a name age and an address for the address I'm going to use rest parameters we can pass in different parts of an ADD address and store it within an array when we create a person object we will assign this.name equals name this. AG equals age now for the address we're going to construct an address object this. address equals a new address we're going to call the Constructor of our address class and pass in our address I'm going to utilize the spread operator to spread our address we'll send our address object a street City and Country all right let's construct some of these person objects const person one equals a new person this will call the Constructor but we have to pass in arguments to match the parameters a name we'll just do a first name to keep it short and age SpongeBob will be 30 we also need an address a street City and Country 124 con Street City will be Bikini Bottom his country will be international waters and just for readability I'm going to put the address on a new line let's create person two person two will be Patrick Patrick age 37 Patrick will live on 128 con Street you'll have the same city and the same country then let's make person three person three will be Squidward age 45 Squidward will live on 126 con Street all right let's see if this all worked console.log let's start with person one person one. name which is SpongeBob age 30 let's get his address address and this returns an object which is good that's what we wanted we have a nested object an address object for some of the properties within that address object we have a street City and Country we use the property accessor again of dot give me the street 124 con Street the city bikini bottom and the country international waters all right let's confirm this with person three just to be sure it all works person three give me the name Squidward age 45 address gives me an object we'll use the property accessor again give me the street 126 con Street the city bikini bottom and the country international waters this will also all work for person two if it worked with person one and three all right everybody so those are nested objects they're objects inside of other objects they allow you to represent more complex data structures a child object is enclosed by a parent object in this example our address is the child object of the person object we're creating a new object within our person object and well everybody those are nested objects in JavaScript
UHZcJyVXtLo,JavaScript DESTRUCTURING in 8 minutes! 💥,2023-11-20T13:27:06Z,hey what's good everybody so in today's video I'm going to give you a lesson in destructuring in JavaScript destructuring allows us to extract values from arrays and objects then assign them to variables in a convenient way we can use straight brackets to perform array destructuring or curly braces to perform object destructuring I'll give you five different examples example one swap the value of two variables we'll have let a equal 1 let b equal to use array D structuring we need a set of straight brackets add the variables a comma B this will equal we're creating a new array on the right hand side B comma a on the left hand side of our equals we're using destructuring on the right hand side we're creating an array let's see what's within variables A and B console.log variable a then variable B so if these values are swapped we should have two then one not one and two that's example one we can use destructuring to swap the value of two variables example two we can swap two elements in an array let's create an array of colors const colors equals an array pick some colors I'll go with RGB so that would be red green blue let's add black and white suppose I would like to swap the position of the first element and the last element this first element has an index of zero this particular last element has an index of four again we're going to use array to structuring we need a set of straight brackets we'll take our array colors at index of zero comma array at index of four we want to swap red with white 0 1 2 3 4 that's the fourth index equals we're creating a new array by using Straight brackets colors at index 4 comma colors at index0 then let's print our array console.log R array of colors there we go we have white green blue black red that's how we can use destructuring to swap two elements in an array example three we can assign array elements to variables we'll declare a bunch of variables const we'll use destructuring we're destructuring an array we need a set of straight brackets we'll create some variable names first color Second Color third color I will assign this equal to our array colors let's print these variables console.log our first color we have red second color green third color blue you could combine a radi structuring with rest parameters we have two colors left let's assign that to a new array we'll use rest parameters I will name this array EXT ra colors then we will console.log extra colors and that should be a new array that has the remaining colors black and white that's how to assign array elements to variables using destructuring example for extract values from objects we'll create two people objects const person one person one will have a few properties first name will be SpongeBob last name will be SquarePants age will be 30 and a job meaning occupation not John job his job is that he is a fry cook all right let's copy person one looks like that n should be capital in last name all right let's copy person one paste it change person one to person two the first name of person two will be Patrick last name star age will be 34 person two is not going to have a job property he's unemployed using destructuring I can extract values from these objects we'll create a few variables const we'll use object destructuring we need a set of curly braces this time we'll create these variables first name last name age and job now this equals let's start with person one let's display these variables console.log first name is SpongeBob last name SquarePants age 30 job fry cook let's do this with person two Patrick Star his ages 34 person two does not have a job property person one does though our job variable is undefined as you can see here you can set default values when using destructuring if somebody doesn't have a job property we'll set job to equal unemployed let's see if that works yep Patrick Star age 34 his job is he's unemployed that's how you can extract values from objects values extracted can even have default values all right last example we can destructure in function parameters we can pass an object to a function and destructure it when it's passed in let's create a function we will create a function to display a person with the parameters we'll use destructuring we're destructuring an object we need a set of curly braces we'll receive an object such as this I'm going to invoke display person we'll pass in person one as an argument when we receive person one as an argument we'll destructure that object right away we will create a first name parameter last name age and job all we'll do is print a few lines using console.log I'll use a template string let's say Name colon space I'll add a placeholder first name and last name let's add a new line age call in space add a placeholder age then lastly job job colon space add a placeholder job we're passing in person one and D structuring it we should display name SpongeBob SquarePants age 30 job fry cook let's pass in person two as an argument name Patrick Star age 34 job is undefined again we can set a default value when destructuring if an object doesn't have a job property we will set that equal to be unemploy employed Patrick Star age 34 job unemployed then if we pass in person one again his job should not be unemployed he's a fry cook there is a job property so we do not use the default value all right everybody so those are a few examples of destructuring there's a lot you can do with destructuring you use a set of straight brackets to perform array destructuring or curly braces for object destructuring they allow you to extract values from arrays an object then assign them to variables in a convenient way and well that is destructuring in JavaScript
KQVCAnh6Afk,JavaScript GETTERS &amp; SETTERS are awesome!!! 📐,2023-11-19T22:26:08Z,hey hello so uh today I'm going to explain Getters and Setters in JavaScript Getters are special methods that make a property readable Setters are special methods that make a property writable we can use Getters and Setters to validate and modify a value when reading or writing a property it helps with validation when creating an object or updating one of its properties here's an example we will create a class of rectangle we need a con structor we will have two parameters a width and a height we will assign this do width equals width this do height equals height now let's create a rectangle object const rectangle equals a new rectangle for the width let's say -1 million something ridiculous and for the height I want the height to be Pizza the word pizza then let's console.log our rectangles width and the rectangle's height we have created a rectangle object with the width of 1 million and a height of pizza which doesn't make any sense we could use some validation when creating an object we don't want people to enter in garbage values like negative a million or string when we're expecting a positive number for the width or height that's where Getters and Setters come in we'll begin with Setters when setting one of these properties either initially through a Constructor or updating one of them later such as setting the width or height equal to some value we can go through a Setter first outside of our Constructor we will set a property we'll begin with width this will be a special type of method the parameter will be new withth what do we want to check before assigning this property using an if statement let's check to see if the new width that the user sends us is greater than zero if it is we will assign this doore width using an underscore prefix it tells other developers that this is a private property you shouldn't touch it at all you could say that this private property of WID is different than our standard width property we will assign the private property of width equal to the new width we receive else let's console. error not log we'll use error this time width must be a positive number all right let's see what happens width must be a positive number and our width is currently undefined which is good okay let's do this with height let's copy our Setter for width paste it but change every instance of width to be height set height New Height be sure to use that Camel case naming convention if new height is greater than zero assign the private property of height equal to the new height else console. error height must be a positive number and there we go that worked width must be a positive number and height must be a positive number our width and height are currently undefined in order to set the width and height we have to pass in a positive number for the width I will say three for the width four now when we access width and height those numbers still aren't showing up that's because these properties are writable via Setters but they're not readable that's where Getters come in we'll create two Getters one for width we'll need to use the get keyword get width this will be another type of method all we're going to do is return this private width and that appeared to work we have three for the width let's do so with the height we will return this private height we have three and four Now by using Setters we can even update those values later let's take our rectangles with set that equal to be five take the height set it equal to be six and that also appears to work but again if I try and update those values to some garbage values like a million and the word Pizza we get those errors again and our object retains its initial values that we previously assigned it three and four with Getters we can even use the property accessor that dot to access a property that doesn't necessarily exist for example we will get area we'll perform a calculation we will return this private width times this private height so now we can access area as if it was a property we have three for the width height four our width times our height gives us an area of 12 our area isn't a property technically it's not found within our Constructor but we can access it as if it was a property with a getter with Getters you can even add additional logic I would like to preserve the initial values of our width and height when I return their value I will use the two fixed method to give each of these a Precision of one let's do that with the width the height and the area but that's going to be a little more complex we'll enclose width time height then add to fixed one and why stop there I'll add centimeters to the end of each I'll use a template string add a placeholder then add CM for centimeters 3.0 cm and the area 12. 0 CM let's make that centim squared because it's area Technically when you're assigning values even when you're initially creating an object you can go through the Setters for input validation when you retrieve values and try and read them you can add additional logic too let's go over a second example we will create a class of person we need a Constructor we will accept a first name last name and an age this. first name equals first name this. last name equals last name this. AG equals age let's construct a person const person equals new person let's enter in some values that don't make sense sense the person's first name will be the number 420 their last name is the number 69 their age is the word Pizza let's console.log our person objects first name which is the number 420 their last name 69 and their age the word Pizza we need to validate this input before assigning the properties that's why we need Setters we will set the first name property this is a special type of method the parameter is going to be a new first name we need to be sure that this value passed in is a string and the length is greater than zero we could write something like this we need an if statement let's check the type of our new first name is it strictly equal to a string and is our new first nam's length property greater than zero if all of that checks out we will assign this private first name equal to the new first name we receive else let's console. error first name must be a nonempty string let's see if this worked I'm going to save first name must be a non-empty string and currently our first name is undefined okay that worked let's copy our Setter for our first name paste it change every instance of first name to last name new last name check if the type of our last name is equal to a string and if our new last name the length of it is greater than zero if it is assign the private last name property equal to the new last name else last name must be a non-empty string that also worked our first name and last name are undefined let's do this with age set our age the parameter is going to be New Age using an if statement is the type of new age strictly equal to a data type of number and is our new age greater than or equal to zero if it is take this private age equals our new age else we're going to console do error age must be a non negative number we can no longer assign pizza for our age unfortunately all right we have our setter set up now let's work on the Getters let's assign some legitimate values for the first name SpongeBob last name SquarePants age 30 we don't have those errors anymore that means they're set but those properties aren't readable that's why we need Getters let's get the first name get first name return this private first name there's SpongeBob his first name get last name return this private last name there's his last name let's create a getter for a full name too let's console.log a full name even though we have no property for that that's undefined we'll use a getter to mimic a full name property by just combining the first name and the last name properties get full name return I'm going to use some string catnation this private first name plus aace character this private last name and there's his full name SpongeBob SquarePants and the age get age return this private age and SpongeBob is 30 all right everybody those are Getters and Setters Getters are special methods that make a property readable Setters are special methods that make a property writable by using a combination of both we can validate and modify a value when reading or writing a property and well everybody those are Getters and Setters in JavaScript
U2vxAEiaVRY,Learn JavaScript CLASSES in 6 minutes! 🏭,2023-11-17T17:38:25Z,all right let's do this thing so I got to talk about classes and JavaScript classes are an es6 feature that provides a more structured and cleaner way to work with objects compared to the traditional Constructor functions that we're normally used to classes are going to be really helpful when we reach future topics such as the static keyword encapsulation and inheritance in this example I have a Constructor for a product our product needs a name and a price for example we have a shirt and the price is $19.99 instead of using a Constructor method we're instead going to use a class our class will include a Constructor so let's start from the beginning to create a class you type class then the name of the object so our class is going to serve as a blueprint our objects will be products then add a set of curly braces to use a Constructor we can use the Constructor keyword within our class list any par parameters we will have a name and a price for each product we will assign the properties of this.name equals the name parameter that we receive this. price equals price I will also create a function our function will be display product now inside of a class you don't need to use the function keyword when we would like to display this product we will console log product colon space I'll include a placeholder this. name let's also output the price price pick a unit of currency I'll use American dollars this do price let's create some product objects const product one equals to create a new object we have to use that new keyword the name of the class product the Constructor is going to be called automatically but we do need to pass in a name and a price as arguments we will pass in a shirt the price will be $19.99 just to be sure that everything works let's invoke the display product method product one do display product method here are the details of our product object product shirt priced $19.99 let's create a few more so this class is reusable product two will be pants I'll pick 2250 for the price let's display product two product two and we will use the display product method of our class product pants the price is $22.50 uh it looks like I only have one decimal point I'm going to make one change after the price I will use the two fixed method and set this to be two decimals there 2250 all right product three const product 3 equals new product our third product is going to be underwear this underwear is really expensive it's $100 it's really good underwear guys product 3. display product product underwear price $100 here's a challenge round I'm going to add another method this method will have one parameter sales tax we'll create a method to calculate a total including tax so let's create a new method inside of a class we don't need the function keyword calculate total there will be one parameter sales tax all we're going to do is return this. Price Plus to calculate the sales tax we'll take this. price times the sales tax assuming it's a percentage okay let's display product one product one. display product I'm also going to create a constant for the sales tax that's not going to change const sales tax let's say the sales tax is 5% 0.05 I will create a variable const total equals let's take product one use the calculate total method but we have to pass in sales tax we can either pass in this number or this variable once we have our total let's display it console.log I'll use a template string total price in parentheses with t tax I'll add a placeholder display the total pick a unit of currency I'll use American dollars then I'll add two fixed two to set it to two decimal places all right our product is a shirt price is $1 199.99 total price with tax is $20.99 let's do this with product two product 2. display product product 2. calculate total pants 2250 total price 2363 let's check out our really expensive underwear product 3. display product product 3. calculate total our underwear is $100 including sales tax it's $15 all right everybody so those are classes they're an es6 feature that provide a more structured and cleaner way to work with objects compared to the traditional Constructor functions that we learned about in the last video classes are going to be really helpful with a few upcoming topics and well everybody those are classes in JavaScript
HFaxylC7bUc,JavaScript FUNCTIONS are easy! 📞,2023-11-03T13:26:37Z,hey welcome back so today I gotta explain functions in JavaScript a function is a section of reusable code you declare that code once and you can use it whenever you want all you have to do is call the function to execute that code here's an example we'll create a function to sing Happy Birthday whenever we call this function it's going to sing Happy Birthday so to declare a function you type function a unique function name let's name our function happy birthday because it's well the happy birthday function then you add a set of parentheses then you add a set of curly braces any code we write between this set of curly braces we can reuse whenever we want so what do we want to do exactly with this function I'll create the lyrics to my own Happy Birthday song console.log happy birthday to you let's repeat that again happy birthday dear you happy birthday to you trust me I'm going somewhere with this so we have a function when we run the program it currently doesn't do anything to execute this code within the function we have to call the function by its name happy birthday then add a set of parentheses so now we should execute this code yep happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear you happy birthday to you so to call a function you type the function name then you add a set of parentheses I like to think of the parentheses as two telephones talking to each other that's how I remember it so if I were to call this function again what do you think is going to happen well we're going to execute this function twice three times we'll execute it three times as many times as I want in fact that's what a function is it's a section of reusable code reuse it whenever you want you just have to call it you can send a function some values or variables let's change our happy birthday function I will turn this line into a template literal let's replace U with the placeholder then we'll add a username I'll add one more line we'll use a template literal you are insert a placeholder age ears old so when I run this program we have an uncaught reference error username is not defined at happy birthday so our happy birthday function doesn't know what our username is or the age so we can send some information to the function when we call it so within the set of parentheses what would we like to send this function let's send our name so whatever values you place within the function be sure to comma separate them so why don't you go ahead and send the happy birthday function a name and an age but there's one step missing these are known as arguments their data that you send a function but you need a matching set of parameters within the parentheses of the Declaration in a way we can Define some temporary variables and they're all comma separated we will Define a username parameter as well as age now this function should work properly happy birthday dear bro code you are 25 years old so these are parameters and what you send the function are arguments let's call the function but send different information happy birthday uh how about SpongeBob will be I don't know how old he is according to SpongeBob lore but let's say he's 30 years old happy birthday dear SpongeBob you are 30 years old how about Patrick this time it's his birthday everybody gets a birthday Patrick will be 37. happy birthday dear Patrick you are 37 years old so that's a benefit of passing arguments to a function when the function receives this data it can do something with it now the order of the parameters does matter if I were to switch age and username here's what happens happy birthday dear37 you are Patrick years old with the arguments that you're passing to your function you'll want to be sure that the parameters match up all right now I'm gonna cover the return keyword we'll create a few other function examples we'll create a function to add two numbers function add then we'll need two arguments which we will name X and Y so when we invoke this function I would like to add X and Y together I'll create a temporary variable named result just to store the result equals X Plus y so I'm going to add two numbers together let's add two and three together and let's see what happens well nothing appears to happen well we can send some data back to the place in which we call a function but we need to use this return keyword let's return the result so two plus three should be 5. after this function resolves think of this function becoming the value 5. so we'll probably want to do something with that value I'll store that within a variable let answer equal add two and three then let's console.log the answer which should be five when you return something from a function after you resolve the function think of it as becoming whatever is returned in this case it's our result or otherwise I can place this function within console.log if we don't plan to store it at all so add two and three then display the result which is five there is a shortcut too you don't necessarily need to declare a variable within this function we could shorten this to return X Plus y that is also valid so that should return 5. okay let's create a subtract function function subtract will return x minus y well we need a matching set of parameters because I forgot that okay let's see what happens when we subtract three from two that'll give us negative one let's multiply function multiply we'll multiply X and Y together return x times y we will multiply two times three which is six divide we need parameters X and Y then return x divided by y then we will invoke the divide function pass in two and three and the result is 0.66 repeating let's go over a more complex example we'll create a function to determine if a number is even or odd here's the function function is even we have one parameter a number so when we invoke the function we'll have to pass in a number so when we receive a number how do we check to see if this number is even here's one solution we'll use an if statement if our number modulus 2. modulus gives you the remainder of any division if this number divides by two evenly if this is equal to zero and yes I'm using the strict equality operator I'm trying to use that more often if our number is divisible by 2 then let's return the Boolean value true else will return false okay let's console.log let's check to see if a number is even let's start with 10 is 10 even that is true how about 11. that is false 12 12 is even so that's kind of cool if you would like a shortcut for this you can use the trinary operator that would look something like this we are going to return then a condition what are we checking is our number modulus 2. strictly equal to zero question mark so that is the ternary operator the question mark if it is true then we will return a Boolean value of true colon false if it's false is 12 even that is true is 13 Even no it's not it's odd how about 14. that is true all right last example I think we're probably getting the hang of this now we'll create a function to see if an email is valid function is valid email what kind of information are we going to send we'll set that up as a parameter we will need an email will invoke the is valid email function and pass in an email why don't you type in your email I'll just make one up bro at fake.com so when we invoke this function this string of text will become our email we'll check to see if our email contains the at character we'll use an if statement if email and there's a built-in method for this the includes method if our email includes the at character then we will return true that is a valid email they have the at character else we will return false is my email valid that is true let's remove the at character brofick.com maybe it's a website or something that is false let's try another email again we're going to invoke the function is valid email Elon Musk dot com don't actually go there I don't know what's gonna pop up uh that is not a valid email all right how about Zuckerberg at meta.com that is a valid email it contains a net character and for something like this if we're returning either true or false we can use the Trenary operator return then our condition is we're going to check if our email includes the at character then add the ternary operator if this is true return true else we will return false so these should be the same which they are all right everybody so that's an introduction to functions it's a section of reusable code you declare some code once and use it whenever you want you call the function to execute that code if you need to send your function some data you'll need a matching set of arguments and parameters and you can return something too with the return keyword we'll have more practice with this in the future don't worry and that is an introduction to functions in JavaScript
TDUz9QcGPoE,Learn JavaScript WHILE LOOPS in 8 minutes! 🔁,2023-10-30T14:33:46Z,hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain why Loops in JavaScript a while loop will repeat some code while some condition is true take this program for example we have a variable username if our username is equal to an empty string then we will console.log you didn't enter your name else console.log hello username if I run this program then check within our console well we didn't enter our username now if I were to change this program to a while loop while our username is equal to an empty string repeat this line of code Forever Until this condition is no longer true then when we escape the while loop we can print the message hello username this is what happens when I run the program we just print this line of code Forever and my computer is probably going to crash I can't seem to stop help okay I think it broke a while loop will continue some code infinitely while this condition is true if it no longer is true then we can escape the while loop if I were to set my username to be something other than an empty string well we never actually enter the while loop we skip over it entirely and go straight to console.log at the end so what we do first is check the condition if it's true then we get sucked into the while loop and execute this forever you usually want some sort of way to exit the while loop while you're in it otherwise you get what is known as an infinite Loop so let's rewrite this program let username equal an empty string while our username is strictly equal to an empty string let's ask the user to enter in their name username equals I'll use a window prompt enter your name okay let's try this again enter your name I'll press ok we can't seem to close this window until we type in something you can see I'm clicking on okay nothing's happening I will type in my name press ok then our console displays hello whatever your name is so that's a benefit of a while loop repeat some code until this condition is no longer true since we populated our username our username was not equal to an empty string we filled username with some characters what if I instead press cancel hello null null means no value username will equal null if I press the cancel button let's append this condition or username is strictly equal to null now I shouldn't be able to continue until I type in something and I can't escape if I hit cancel while one of these conditions is true execute this code Forever let's type in our name again and now we can escape the while loop there's also another variation of a while loop it's known as a do while loop how that works is that you can move while and the condition to the end so we'll place it here then precede the set of curly braces with do so we will always execute this code at least once then check the condition at the end using a do while loop I don't necessarily need to set the username I can set it to be undefined if I set my username to be undefined then use a standard while loop we never execute the while loop our username equals undefined it doesn't equal an empty string or the value null so we skip over the while loop entirely so a do while loop is another variation of a while loop do the code first then check the condition at the end so there's a few different ways you can write the same program all right let's go over another example we'll create three variables let logged in logged in will be false to begin with to log in we have to type in a matching username I will declare a username but not assign it and a password so let's create a while loop how do we escape the while loop let's say while not I'll use the notch logical operator while not logged in once we're logged in once this is true we escape the while loop we will ask a user for their username username equals window dot prompt enter your username let's ask for a password as well password equals enter your password I'll add an if statement within the while loop we'll check to see if our username is strictly equal to then make up some username my user name and if our password is strictly equal to some password like my password if our username and password both match these values then we can log in so logged in will equal true then I'll console.log a confirmation message you are logged in else let's console.log another message invalid credentials please try again all right let's see if this works enter your username I am just going to press ok enter your password I'll type in something legitimate so I'll type in my password uh invalid credentials please try again that's because I didn't type in a username I'll type in my username be sure it matches my username my password and we are now logged in so since we set logged in to be true when we go back to the beginning of our while loop this condition is no longer true while not logged in but since we're logged in we escape the while loop now another variation of this is the do while loop let's cut the condition along with while added to the end then add do to the beginning so we'll check to see if we're logged in at the end it pretty much does the same thing but with one exception in this program how this is different is that I can set logged in to be true to begin with we'll still receive that prompt I'll type in my username type in my password we are currently logged in so we do not continue the while loop if we used a standard while loop And We Begin by being logged in well we never ask for any of this we never enter the while loop while not logged in do all of this but since we are logged in we don't do any of it alright everybody so that's while Loops repeat some code while some condition is true while some condition remains true execute this code Forever Until it's no longer true and well everybody that's while Loops in JavaScript
z2fcWdoph4U,Learn JavaScript SWITCHES in 6 minutes! 💡,2023-10-24T13:40:04Z,hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain switches a switch can be an efficient replacement to using many else if statements here's an example of a program I wrote without using a switch we have a day day will normally be the number 1 through 7even if day equals 1 will console.log it is Monday which you can see here if day was two well then it's Tuesday all the way up to 7 which is Sunday I do have an else statement that states our day variable is not a day for example if I set day to be I don't know like a string of pizza well then Pizza is not a day but it really should be if you find yourself using a lot of else if statements I would instead recommend creating a switch here's how to create one we'll keep our day variable I'll set that to be one to create a switch we will type switch parentheses curly braces within the parenthesis of the switch we will place a variable or a value what are we examining let's examine our day variable we examine a value against matching cases to create a case type case then a value or a condition we will see if day equals one so day case one are these two values equal if they are then we can do something we can execute some code so add a colon then any code underneath this case will be ex executed if there's a match between our value or variable day and this value so let's console.log it is Monday then be sure to add a break I'll demonstrate why you need break later so day is one it is Monday let's add another case for case 2 in case day equals 2 so let's copy and paste what we have case two it is Tuesday let's change day to B2 it is Tuesday all right let's do this all the way up to case seven all right we have cases 1 through 7 if I change day to be S well then it is Sunday you can also add a default case in case there are no matches now what if we set day to be Pizza which doesn't make sense well there are no matching cases once we review all of the cases and there's no matches we exit the switch you also have the the capability to add a default case in case there are no matches what's the default behavior of the switch if there's no matching cases let's console.log I should probably use a template literal for this if we're inserting a variable our day variable is not a day so now we should execute this default case Pizza is not a day all right now the reason that we have these break statements is to break out of the switch once we have a matching case I'll demonstrate what happens if we remove these all right let's set day to be two as in Tuesday it is Tuesday it is Wednesday it is Thursday it is Friday it is Saturday it is Sunday two is not a day so the reason that we have these breakes is to break out of the switch if we don't have them once we have a matching case we will execute the code found within that space then Cascade down and execute any code that follows after including code within different cases so that's why you want these break statements after each case to break out of the switch let's go over a more complex example let's say we have a test score variable between 0 and 100 my score will be 92 92% I will also create a letter grade variable which we will declare but not aign I'm going to examine our test score so another way in which you can write a switch is something like this I'm going to examine the value of true against matching cases which contain a condition so case then I'll write a condition is test score greater than or equal to 90 as in 90% this condition will evaluate to be true or false if true is equal to true we will do some code if this is false we skip over it if our test score is greater than or equal to 90 let's assign our letter grade variable to equal an a then be sure to break then I'm going to test this with console.log we will display our letter grade we have an A let's do this for anything greater than 80 the user will receive a B test score greater than or equal to 80 letter grade will equal B let's change our test score to be 85 the user receives a b let's follow this pattern 70 will be a c yep C 60 will be a d 60 is D then for the default case I will set letter grade to be F letter grade equals F if I set my test score to be 33% so with the test score of 33 the letter grade is f all right everybody so that's a switch if if you find you're using a lot of L if statements I would recommend using a switch instead it's not bad if you have a few but if you have many I would use a switch instead and well everybody those are switches in JavaScript
atS_A9HHAVo,JavaScript TERNARY OPERATOR in 6 minutes!  ❓,2023-10-23T13:54:46Z,hey uh welcome back so today I'm going to explain the Trenary operator in JavaScript you write a condition then add a little question mark kind of like you're asking a question how is this useful well it's a shortcut to if and else statements it helps to assign a variable based on a condition you write a condition then use the ternary operator as if you're asking a question you can write some code if that condition is true what would you like to do then add a colon then some code if that condition is false here's an example let's say we have a user's age age equals 21. I would like to check to see if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 18. age greater than equal to 18 then I will use the ternary operator kind of like I'm asking a question is age greater than or equal to 18 if this condition is true we can write some code I'll create a string you're an adult then what if the condition is false I'll add a colon then I will execute this code if the condition is false you're a minor this is helpful if you need to assign a variable based on a condition so I'll create a new variable let message equals then we write our condition so if age is greater than or equal to 18 if that's true we will assign this string to this variable this message if it's false instead we will assign this one it's an alternative to writing something like this so with programming we try not to repeat ourselves if we don't have to here we're assigning message to be either this string or this one our ternary operator is more condensed and I feel like it's easier to read than that if else statement it's a shortcut if you choose to use it I tend to use it a lot then just to test it let's console.log our message just to be sure that it works fine console.log our message our age is 21 you're an adult if my age was 12. you'll remind her let's go over a few more exercises this time we will have let time time will be between 1 and 24 like a 24 hour clock I will set time to be 16. 16 I think would be 4 P.M we will assign a greeting equals then we'll write a condition is time less than 12. the enternary operator like we're asking a question if the time is less than 12 it's the morning good morning we'll use a colon then write some code if it's false if it's not the morning it's at least the afternoon good afternoon then let's console.log our greeting good afternoon because it's 4 P.M what if it was 9. good morning all right I have a few more examples foreign student this will be true or false if you're a student let message equals now with the Boolean variable you can just write the Boolean variable itself is student question mark are you a student if so you are a student if not you are not a student then let's console.log our message we are a student you are a student let's set this to be false you are not a student it's very easy to read with Boolean variables you write the Boolean variable then add a question mark here's a challenge round we will have a purchase amount as if somebody's buying something if somebody's purchase amount is over one hundred dollars they get a 10 discount so let purchase amount equal let's say 125 dollars or some other unit of currency of your choosing let discount equals then the condition is we're checking if purchase amount is greater than or equal to 100 100 question mark is somebody's purchase amount greater than one hundred dollars if so they will get a 10 discount colon if that's false they get no discount zero so then let's display the total console.log I'll use a template literal your total is I need a dollar sign for our unit of currency then I need a placeholder so I need another dollar sign the purchase amount minus the purchase amount multiplied by let me scoot over a little the discount divided by 100 so the total since we get a discount is one hundred twelve dollars and fifty cents if our purchase amount was ninety nine dollars well we don't get that discount your total is 99. all right everybody so that's the Trenary operator it's a shortcut to an if else statement it helps to assign a variable based on a condition you write a condition add a question mark as if you're asking a question do this code if that condition is true else do this code if that condition is false I'll be using the ternary operator a lot just because I feel like it's helpful and well that is the ternary operator in JavaScript
uy-1WNqecnI,Why the Math object in JavaScript is useful 🧮,2023-10-19T14:54:18Z,hey what's going on everybody so today I'm going to explain math math is a built-in JavaScript object that provides a collection of math related properties and methods for example if you ever need the value of pi you would type math with a capital M do PI then let's console.log this console.log math.pi Pi is 3.14 and the rest of the digits if you need e e is known as ul's number it's used for the base of natural logarithms we won't really be using e in the series but if you ever need it it's there math does give you access to a lot of useful math related methods let's create a few variables let X = 3.21 let y equal to and let Z will be undefined if you need to round a number let's say Z equals you can type math.round method Place whatever value or variable you would like to round within the round method let's round X store the result within Z then display z console.log z so 3.21 rounded is three even there's also floor floor will always round down let's change 3.21 to 3. 99 let's copy this line paste it change round to floor floor always rounds down so 3.99 rounded down is again three to always round up you can use seal as in seiling the opposite of floor c e i l let's change 3.99 to 3.21 3.21 rounded up is four then there's truncate trunk short for truncate will eliminate any decimal portion 3.21 truncated is three another way to raise a base to a given power is to use the pow method P let's raise three to the power of 2 so x to the power of Y which would be 9 y to the^ of X would be 8 there's a square root function sqrt let's find the square root of how about 81 the square root of 81 is 9 if you ever need to find the natural logarithm of a number you can use the log function math. log let's set X to be 10 the natural logarithm of 10 is 2.3 if you need to do anything with trigonometry there's s cosine and tangent functions let's begin with s s n within this function you will place radians I'll set X to be 45 so Z is going to be 0.85 so that's s let's do cosine which is cosos 0.52 then tangent T and that is 1.61 let's change X to be 3.21 again to find the absolute value of a number you can use the absolute value function math.abs it's basically going to give you the same number but it's going to be positive the absolute value of - 3.21 is 3.2 2 1 basically we're eliminating the negative sign to find the sign of a number you can use the sign function s i g n so the sign of - 3.21 is1 If This Were a positive number it would be one if it's zero then the sign is zero here's a pretty helpful method we can find the maximum or minimum value from a set of values or variables let's set Z to be 1 y will stay as two and X will be three I will create a new variable named Max it will store the maximum value from these three variables math. Max comma separate each of the variables x y z then display the maximum within our console. log method the maximum value from these three variables is three then there's Min for the minimum let Min do Min so the minimum of these three variables is one all right everybody so that's math it's a built-in JavaScript object that provides a collection of properties which was pi and d and methods such as round truncate power methods related to trigonometry and Max and Min methods they're pretty helpful if you ever need them and well that is what math is in JavaScript
jLRnuVHwHKk,Learn JavaScript TYPE CONVERSION in 5 minutes! 💱,2023-10-18T13:33:44Z,all right so uh yeah type conversion type conversion is the process of changing the data type of a value to another data type for example we can convert strings to numbers numbers to booleans booleans to Strings numbers to strings booleans to numbers I think you get the idea why might we want to do this well when we accept user input the data type of that input is a string if we need to use it for any sort of math we need to convert it to a number here's an example let's say we have variable age I will create a window prompt window dot prompt we will ask a user how old are you I'm going to add 1 to our age age plus equals one then console.log age how old are you let's say I'm 25 press OK let's inspect our page go to console it shows that age is 251. when we accept user input it's a string data type a series of characters by adding one we appended one to the end of our string we're not increasing our age by one we're doing string concatenation we are going to convert our user input into a number and this is how so after accepting our user input and before making any changes to it let's reassign age equal to and this is a function the number function it will convert another data type such as a string or Boolean into a number then we'll place our Edge variable within that function so now this should work how old are you let's say I'm 25 press ok 26. so that's the reason you may want to type convert because different data types behave differently along with my age variable I'm going to display the type of age what's the data type how old are you 25 press OK 26 and it shows that the data type of age is number if we removed this type conversion and then run this again it shows that our age is 251 and it's a string which is not exactly what we would like that's a reason why type conversion is important let me give you another example let's create three variables let X let y and let Z I'll show you what happens when we convert different values into different data types let's say x is the word Pizza same thing with y and z I will type Cast X as a number then we need to place X within the number function I kind of want to see what happens when we try and convert pizza into a number it's probably not going to go well let's convert Y into a string then Z will be a Boolean let's console DOT log X as well as the type of x let's do the same thing with y and z alright what's gonna happen if you attempt to convert alphabetical characters into a number that variable will be Nan which means not a number the data type is still number though as you can see the word Pizza is already a string so converting it into a string really doesn't do anything that's why for this line the value is still pizza and the data type is still a string if you convert a string into a Boolean booleans again are either true or false converting the word pizza into a Boolean returns true and the data type is Boolean so basically as long as there's some value here and you convert it into a Boolean it will always be true let's replace pizza with zero what will happen we can convert 0 into a number it doesn't contain any alphabetical characters X contains zero it's a number Y is zero but it's treated as a string Z contains true and it's a Boolean what about empty strings just a set of quotes typecasting an empty string is a number is still zero we have an empty string for y then with our Boolean it's false why might you want to type cast a string as a Boolean that's one way in which you can check to see if user input is empty like did somebody type something in if a user skipped user input it's most likely going to be an empty string then you can check to see like if this is false then the user didn't type in anything and you can let them know what about a variable that's declared but not assigned a value converting an undefined variable to a number results in not a number our string is undefined and our Boolean variable returns false so that's the basics of type conversion it's the process of changing the data type of a value to another it's pretty important when you accept user input because when you accept user input it's a string data type at times you may want to convert it to a number if you need to include that number with any sort of arithmetic expressions or a Boolean if you're checking to see if that user input was completed we'll have more practice with this in the future and well that is type conversion in JavaScript
uu0lOX6Ot3s,How to create a CSS image gallery in 5 minutes! 📷,2023-09-21T16:58:45Z,hey what's going on everybody today we're going to create an interactive image gallery using HTML and CSS so let's get started before you do jump in I would recommend downloading three pictures of your choosing I have a picture of a pizza a salad and soup if you're able to try and find images that are roughly the same height and width once you have your three or more images we are ready to begin we'll begin with the first image I'll use a div element and I will give this development a class of gallery because it's well part of our image gallery I will include my image image The Source attribute will be the relative file path of the image if you have a lot of pictures I would recommend creating an images folder you know what let's actually do that it'd be good practice new folder images I'll move all of these images to my images folder all right so I will list the relative file path I need to navigate to the images folder but of course you can use your own pictures depending on what you're building exactly images dot I think that was a JPEG all right so this picture is massive in case somebody is using a screen reader it's good practice to add an alternative attribute then give a description of the image salad I'll turn this image into a hyperlink by surrounding it with a pair of anchor tags we can open this image in a new tab by setting the target attribute to equal underscore blank then I will set the hrep attribute to be the source of my image I'll just copy and paste that just temporarily I'm going to set a width for this image width equals 200. what we'll do now is add a description it's entirely optional but I think it would look nice I will create a new development with a class of description I will type the word salads we'll do some CSS styling a little bit later let's copy this entire development paste it twice then we just need to change the images we're using my second image is soup I'll change the alternative text as well and the description soups then my last image is pizza the description will be pizzas all right let's go to our style sheet we are selecting our Gallery class I will set the display property to be an inline block currently these images are Block Level elements now they're all lined up I'll add a border border one pixel solid let's go with a dark gray color I'll use hsl values I'll set the lightness to 60 percent I'll add margin of 5 pixels the margin is applied outside of these developments if I were to increase this you can see the difference I'll keep that as five though let's work on the description for each image we are accessing our Gallery class then within the gallery class we have the description class that should be these developments let's add a little bit of padding 10 pixels then text align Center not bad when we hover over one of these elements let's change the Border color we are taking our gallery we'll apply the hover pseudo class then change the border and make it a little bit darker I'll set the lightness to be like 20. there we are now the Border changes when we hover over one of these elements I'm going to delete these with attributes then go to our style sheet we'll access our Gallery class with any images set the width to be 100 percent and height will be Auto then with the gallery class we can set the width 200 pixels so basically what we did is that we set the width of each image to be 100 of the width of our Gallery whatever this is set to if I were to set the width to be something larger then the size of each element would increase I think 200 is fine all right now let's test it if we click on one of these images we should see the full image in a new tab that's the salad image soup and pizza all right everybody so that is a simple image gallery using HTML and CSS
k3AJx11k9QY,Learn CSS icons in 8 minutes! 🐤,2023-09-21T16:59:23Z,hey what's going on everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can create some font awesome icons using HTML and CSS all right let's get started everybody I'm going to direct you to this website font awesome.com this isn't a sponsorship or anything like that but this is a pretty good place to get some icons Google Icons is another good source but I find that font awesome does have a larger variety of icons to start using icons from this site from the home page we will start for free because I don't like to pay for things you will need a kit you can type in your email like fake gmail.com then send kit code then you just have to confirm your email now once you log in you'll have access to a kit if I were to click on my kit I have a line of JavaScript that contains a link to my kit there's going to be a unique number let's copy the script then place it in the head of our HTML document right here we now have access to those icons on font awesome to browse for icons go to the icons tab then we can perform a search I would like an icon of a home or a house I would like this one so I'll click on it you can choose a classic style or a sharp Style with sharp corners this is solid that's regular this is light I'll stick with solid you can select animations but I won't use animations for this example you can rotate this icon you can change the color and you can change the default size this is 2xs this is 2XL to include this icon we can copy this element it's an eye element so let's copy this eye element within the body of my document I can paste that I element and there's my icon if you want to remove the color and change it with your CSS style sheet we can remove the style attribute if you need something even larger than 2XL we can change this element up to 10 times the size with 10x that's a little too large for my liking let's go with 5X let's find three other icons that we would like I'm going to find the Twitter logo that's right here I need to copy this eye element then I will paste it then I'll change the size fa-5x okay Twitter YouTube would be good copy this eye element paste it again I would like the 5x version fa-5x let's select one more icon let's go with tick tock and that is all we'll need again I would like the 5x sized version all right that's a good amount of icons I will Center all of these icons one way in which I can do that is to place all of these elements within a div with the class of icons all right let's go to our style sheet I will take my class of icons then text align Center to right justify these we can set that to right but I'll keep them in the center I'll change the color of these icons let's begin with our house we'll need to copy this entire class I don't want the sharp version I will copy this entire class then within my style sheet I will select that class dot then paste the name of that class now we can't include spaces you can replace the spaces with the DOT with our house icon let's change the color to something Gray let's go with the lighter color like that okay let's do this with the other icons then we have Twitter replace the spaces with dots I will change the color so let's try and find Twitter blue I think that's fairly close okay then we have YouTube color red then tick tock I think that's fairly close all right now what we'll do is turn these icons into hyperlinks we'll surround each eye mint with a pair of a tags foreign then within the href attribute we can set that to some website I won't set the href attribute to our house icon let's do that with Twitter Youtube and tick tock so with Twitter I will set the href attribute to be https colon to forward slashes twitter.com let's do this with our YouTube icon replace Twitter with YouTube then tick tock so this should work let's click on Twitter that works YouTube and tick tock with hyperlinks there is some underlying text decoration included let's remove that let's take our icons then any anchor tags within our icons class we'll set the text decoration to be none that should remove them I'll also apply a little bit of margin between each of these icons let's do margin Dash right set to 20 pixels not bad for some additional practice when we hover a cursor over one of these icons let's increase the lightness let's begin with our house let's copy these CSS properties paste them we'll apply the hoverseudo class I'll increase the lightness by 10 percent I went from 66 to 76 percent when we hover our cursor over our house icon it should be a little bit lighter okay let's apply this for the other icons then we have Twitter apply the hoverseudo class oh I'm using RGB values let me change that to hsl I'll increase the lightness to 60. let's do this with YouTube then tick tock all right now when we hover our cursor over these icons they should be a little bit lighter Tick Tock is still a little bit dark let me increase it further to 30 percent that's much better all right everybody so that is an introduction to including icons in your web page using CSS
f3uCSh6LIY0,How to create a CSS navigation bar in 6 minutes! 🧭,2023-09-21T16:58:11Z,hey everybody in today's video we're going to create a navigation bar using HTML and CSS so let's get started we'll Begin by creating an H1 title for the title of our web page why don't you go ahead and type in your name or your employer's name or your business name really doesn't matter then I'm going to use a nav element also known as a navigation element navigation elements are typically used for a set of navigation links I will give this nav element a class of navbar then within this navigation element I'll create an unordered list my unordered list will contain one list item for each category in my navigation bar for the first list item let's create a category for home I would like to turn this category into a hyperlink I'll surround this text with a pair of a tags within the opening a tag I will set the href attribute to B I'll just keep it empty for now we'll fill that in later let's copy our list item paste it a few times maybe a total of four links for the categories let's have home about products and contact these are a few common categories you may see for a navigation bar all right then outside of our navigation bar let's use a main element for the main content for our web page I'll add an H3 element for a sort of subtitle for the main section of our content this is the home page then I'll add a paragraph a text to generate some text in vs code you can type lorem then hit tab alright that is what we need for now let's go to our style sheet the first thing I'm going to do is text align our H1 element and set it to Center text align Center the text in our H1 element should be right in the center I will take our navigation bar class select our unordered list set the list style type to be none to remove the bullet points and they are gone now I'll also change the background color let's pick a dark gray color I'll set the lightness to be 25. I'll remove any padding as well as any margins let's style these hyperlinks within our navigation bar class take any a elements set the color to be white remove the text decoration text decoration will be none that removes the underline I'll add some padding of 15 pixels I will display these elements as a block then text align Center there we are this navigation bar is a vertical style navigation bar this is a style you may see at the bottom of a web page when I hover over one of these links I want to change the background color we will take our navigation bar class take any a elements then apply the hover pseudo class when I hover over one of these hyperlinks I'll change the background color I'll turn down the lightness slightly to 10 lightness there we are if you would like a horizontal navigation bar here's a change we can make with our navigation bar class take any list items then we will float left one change we'll make within our unordered list set the Overflow property to be hidden all right that's pretty good so far there is a little bit of margin around the body of my document I am going to set margin to be zero with our body element set any margin to be zero pixels if you would like margin around the main content of your page we will take our main element then set margin to be let's stick with 20 pixels you also could put margin just on the left side and the right side you know what I'm going to set margin left to be 20. and margin right to be 20. all right then lastly let's fill in these href attributes for the href attributes I will set my home link to be index.html about will be about.html products.html and contact.html we're going to go to our website folder we'll create a few copies of our index file we need three more files one two three let's rename one of these as about.html then products.html then contact.html so let's open about I'll change the header element of our main element to be this is the about page let's apply that for products this is the products page then contact this is the contact page all right and that should be everything let's see if this works we're currently on the home page I can go to the about page products contact and home in this example they're all relatively the same except for the H3 title all right everybody and that's how to create a navigation bar using HTML and CSS
Hsu8uqQTSV8,CSS website layout in 9 minutes! 🗺️,2023-09-21T16:58:27Z,hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to show you a basic Website Layout using HTML and CSS all right let's begin so we should know what semantic tags are semantic tags they include but are not limited to headers nav elements main section aside articles and Footers you'll want to use semantic tags because they keep your content organized they're better for search engine optimization and they assist with screen readers and other technology for accessibility so I've already written some HTML markup I just want to describe this first headers are used for introductory content such as a title a logo or author information nav elements they're used for navigation bars or other links sometimes you may find a set of navigation Links at the bottom of your page but having a navigation bar is fairly common now the main content which is all of this it can contain one of many sub-elements such as sections as side elements articles and generic developments so sections which is what I've created here in the middle this is for dependent content you would typically put anything you want within a section it's typically used for dependent content if I were to take this section out of the web page then put it on another web page it might not necessarily make sense like what is it for that's why it's dependent and a side element is meant for side content this can include author information fun facts quotes external links comments or really any other related content that's related to a section now an article this represents independent content this could include news articles job posts or blog posts articles are really similar to sections with articles it's meant for independent content for example a news article if I were to take this news article cut it out and put it on a different website it would still make sense it's independent content it's not reliant on the context of the website whereas in a section would be and then lastly we have Footers a footer is for a closing content this could include author information copyright information and sometimes navigational links there's really no one-size-fits-all approach really the design is up to you but this is a really common format now that we know the basics let's actually design this alright so we will create our semantic elements we have a header a nav element a main element and a footer element within our header element let's just add an H2 element that says header so let's go to our style sheet I'll take our header element let's change the background color background Dash color let's pick a light gray color I'll use hsl values because I like them 84 or 85 is good then let's text align Center and add a little bit of padding 25 pixels okay let's work on our navigation bar it's not going to be a fully functioning navigation bar we've done that in a previous video Let's just allocate some space for navigation bar it is common to have more than one navigation element per web page if we're creating a navigation bar we should set the class to be something like navbar so it's descriptive let's go to our CSS style sheet I will select our navbar class then change the background color let's go with the darker color I'll add some height 50 pixels and that should be good we're just allocating some space we're not creating a full navigation bar there's a little bit of margin around the body of our document I'm going to remove that by selecting our body element then set the margin to be zero or zero pixels that should get rid of the margin all right then we have our main element our main element can include any combination of a side sections articles or even just some generic developments but we won't be working with div in this video really you can see any combination of a side section article or div or maybe even none of them it's up to you in this topic we'll stick with one aside element one section and one article these elements are kind of like sub elements within our main element our main element is going to be the main stake and potatoes of our web page so with our side element I'll include an H2 element for a header this is a side let's do the same thing for Section this is a section then this is an article let me separate these just so that they're easier to see just to take up some space I'm going to create some sample paragraphs our side element will have one our section will have two paragraphs I'm just copying and pasting and our article will have two as well I don't want this top to bottom layout we can change that with some CSS properties so let's work on our side element first with our side element I'll set the width to be 20 of the width of the web page RSI element only takes up 20 percent of the space available the following elements can float we have to set the float property to be left then in this case all right let's copy aside change aside to B section that's our next element I'll set the width to be 40 percent then we have article change section to article and the width will stay at forty percent these three elements can all fit within the web page the total width is under 100 we have our three elements within our main element so if you would like to add a little bit of padding this is what you're going to do let's add 10 pixels of padding to each of these elements when we calculate the width we don't take into account any padding so one change we're going to make is that at the top of our CSS style sheet we can select all elements with an asterisk then a set of curly braces we will set the Box sizing property to border Dash box what we're doing with this property is that when we calculate the width factor in the padding all three elements should be lined up now alright then lastly we have our footer So within our footer element I'll just add an H2 element that says footer then I will style it let's copy what we have for our header paste it change header to be footer now what we need to do is clear our float because we're still floating the elements that come after let's display our footer as a block level element to clear a float you can set clear than both and that should clear that alright so here is a basic Website Layout for a desktop this isn't a good format for a mobile device though with a mobile device you would want each of these elements to be on top of each other so you can scroll down we can add an at rule so at media screen and Max width 600 pixels so what we're doing here is that if the width of our screen or window is 600 pixels or below we can change some CSS properties with a side section and article let's select those aside comma section comma article we'll just change the width to be 100 percent if a user is on a mobile device and or the width is 600 pixels or below then we'll switch to a mobile version of the web page each of these elements are a side section and article elements are taking up 100 of the width available then if we were to expand this web page or we're viewing on a desktop we switch to the desktop version this is also known as responsive CSS all right everybody I know I covered a lot today but that is a basic Website Layout using HTML and CSS
f3uCSh6LIY0,How to create a CSS navigation bar in 6 minutes! 🧭,2023-09-21T16:58:11Z,hey everybody in today's video we're going to create a navigation bar using HTML and CSS so let's get started we'll Begin by creating an H1 title for the title of our web page why don't you go ahead and type in your name or your employer's name or your business name really doesn't matter then I'm going to use a nav element also known as a navigation element navigation elements are typically used for a set of navigation links I will give this nav element a class of navbar then within this navigation element I'll create an unordered list my unordered list will contain one list item for each category in my navigation bar for the first list item let's create a category for home I would like to turn this category into a hyperlink I'll surround this text with a pair of a tags within the opening a tag I will set the href attribute to B I'll just keep it empty for now we'll fill that in later let's copy our list item paste it a few times maybe a total of four links for the categories let's have home about products and contact these are a few common categories you may see for a navigation bar all right then outside of our navigation bar let's use a main element for the main content for our web page I'll add an H3 element for a sort of subtitle for the main section of our content this is the home page then I'll add a paragraph a text to generate some text in vs code you can type lorem then hit tab alright that is what we need for now let's go to our style sheet the first thing I'm going to do is text align our H1 element and set it to Center text align Center the text in our H1 element should be right in the center I will take our navigation bar class select our unordered list set the list style type to be none to remove the bullet points and they are gone now I'll also change the background color let's pick a dark gray color I'll set the lightness to be 25. I'll remove any padding as well as any margins let's style these hyperlinks within our navigation bar class take any a elements set the color to be white remove the text decoration text decoration will be none that removes the underline I'll add some padding of 15 pixels I will display these elements as a block then text align Center there we are this navigation bar is a vertical style navigation bar this is a style you may see at the bottom of a web page when I hover over one of these links I want to change the background color we will take our navigation bar class take any a elements then apply the hover pseudo class when I hover over one of these hyperlinks I'll change the background color I'll turn down the lightness slightly to 10 lightness there we are if you would like a horizontal navigation bar here's a change we can make with our navigation bar class take any list items then we will float left one change we'll make within our unordered list set the Overflow property to be hidden all right that's pretty good so far there is a little bit of margin around the body of my document I am going to set margin to be zero with our body element set any margin to be zero pixels if you would like margin around the main content of your page we will take our main element then set margin to be let's stick with 20 pixels you also could put margin just on the left side and the right side you know what I'm going to set margin left to be 20. and margin right to be 20. all right then lastly let's fill in these href attributes for the href attributes I will set my home link to be index.html about will be about.html products.html and contact.html we're going to go to our website folder we'll create a few copies of our index file we need three more files one two three let's rename one of these as about.html then products.html then contact.html so let's open about I'll change the header element of our main element to be this is the about page let's apply that for products this is the products page then contact this is the contact page all right and that should be everything let's see if this works we're currently on the home page I can go to the about page products contact and home in this example they're all relatively the same except for the H3 title all right everybody and that's how to create a navigation bar using HTML and CSS
Hsu8uqQTSV8,CSS website layout in 9 minutes! 🗺️,2023-09-21T16:58:27Z,hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to show you a basic Website Layout using HTML and CSS all right let's begin so we should know what semantic tags are semantic tags they include but are not limited to headers nav elements main section aside articles and Footers you'll want to use semantic tags because they keep your content organized they're better for search engine optimization and they assist with screen readers and other technology for accessibility so I've already written some HTML markup I just want to describe this first headers are used for introductory content such as a title a logo or author information nav elements they're used for navigation bars or other links sometimes you may find a set of navigation Links at the bottom of your page but having a navigation bar is fairly common now the main content which is all of this it can contain one of many sub-elements such as sections as side elements articles and generic developments so sections which is what I've created here in the middle this is for dependent content you would typically put anything you want within a section it's typically used for dependent content if I were to take this section out of the web page then put it on another web page it might not necessarily make sense like what is it for that's why it's dependent and a side element is meant for side content this can include author information fun facts quotes external links comments or really any other related content that's related to a section now an article this represents independent content this could include news articles job posts or blog posts articles are really similar to sections with articles it's meant for independent content for example a news article if I were to take this news article cut it out and put it on a different website it would still make sense it's independent content it's not reliant on the context of the website whereas in a section would be and then lastly we have Footers a footer is for a closing content this could include author information copyright information and sometimes navigational links there's really no one-size-fits-all approach really the design is up to you but this is a really common format now that we know the basics let's actually design this alright so we will create our semantic elements we have a header a nav element a main element and a footer element within our header element let's just add an H2 element that says header so let's go to our style sheet I'll take our header element let's change the background color background Dash color let's pick a light gray color I'll use hsl values because I like them 84 or 85 is good then let's text align Center and add a little bit of padding 25 pixels okay let's work on our navigation bar it's not going to be a fully functioning navigation bar we've done that in a previous video Let's just allocate some space for navigation bar it is common to have more than one navigation element per web page if we're creating a navigation bar we should set the class to be something like navbar so it's descriptive let's go to our CSS style sheet I will select our navbar class then change the background color let's go with the darker color I'll add some height 50 pixels and that should be good we're just allocating some space we're not creating a full navigation bar there's a little bit of margin around the body of our document I'm going to remove that by selecting our body element then set the margin to be zero or zero pixels that should get rid of the margin all right then we have our main element our main element can include any combination of a side sections articles or even just some generic developments but we won't be working with div in this video really you can see any combination of a side section article or div or maybe even none of them it's up to you in this topic we'll stick with one aside element one section and one article these elements are kind of like sub elements within our main element our main element is going to be the main stake and potatoes of our web page so with our side

web page RSI element only takes up 20 percent of the space available the following elements can float we have to set the float property to be left then in this case all right let's copy aside change aside to B section that's our next element I'll set the width to be 40 percent then we have article change section to article and the width will stay at forty percent these three elements can all fit within the web page the total width is under 100 we have our three elements within our main element so if you would like to add a little bit of padding this is what you're going to do let's add 10 pixels of padding to each of these elements when we calculate the width we don't take into account any padding so one change we're going to make is that at the top of our CSS style sheet we can select

all right everybody I know I covered a lot today but that is a basic Website Layout using HTML and CSS
QctF-i4-GuM,Learn CSS height and width in 6 minutes! 📏,2023-09-21T16:55:23Z,hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to give you an introduction to the width and height properties in CSS all right let's begin everybody we will Begin by creating two div elements and each development will have a class of box within our first box let's create an H2 header with the text of this is number one and we'll create a paragraph underneath to generate some text in vs code you can type lorem then hit tab all right let's copy our div paste it change number one to number two and that's where we're at So within our style sheet we can set a height and a width for an element an ID or a class so let's take our box class dot box I'll add a border border 2 pixel solid just so that it's easier to see here we are okay normally with the height by default it's Auto we don't need to explicitly state that you can see that there's no apparent change when I reload the page so the height is going to be calculated automatically when we render our web page but you can set an explicit height for example 100 pixels that's a little too small our content is kind of overlapping let's change that to 200. now it's a little too big but it is possible to set a fixed height so let's set height back to auto now we will change the width so with the width we can set a number of pixels for example 100 we would have two very long skinny columns and they're right on top of each other that's because divs are Block Level elements we'll Reserve this entire space for each of these developments because they're Block Level so let's change the width to 200 and see what happens now they're more of a box shape if I set width to be Auto the width will be calculated automatically and like I said that's the default these Block Level elements want to take up as much width as possible kind of like your mom if I changed width to be 50 the width of this element will take up 50 percent the width of our viewport but we're still allocating all the space for each development because they're Block Level if I were to use the float property let's float to the left the reason that these elements aren't floating there's still not enough space to place Box 2 next to box one because we have our border our border takes up two pixels if I were to remove the Border they should display back to back which they do you do have to take in the width of the Border when calculating the width the same thing applies with padding let's apply a little bit of padding padding 25 pixels now we have 25 pixels worth of padding between our content and the Border I mean it looks nice right when calculating the height or the width we can disregard any padding or any borders but we have to add this property we'll add box Dash sizing border Dash box when we calculate the height or the width we're allocating disregard any padding or any borders the Box sizing property will take that into consideration we can now fit these elements right next to each other the width of each box is 50 and they both have borders and padding what you also might see with box sizing is that what some people like to do they'll use an asterisk as a selector that means all elements and then they'll apply the Box sizing property to all elements because well it can be kind of annoying to calculate width and Heights while factoring in padding and borders as well all right now if we were to float right box one is on the right box two is on the left let's undo that you can set a minimum height and a minimum width as well so with our two boxes let's get rid of our paragraphs I'm going to text align Center just to Center our text this is number one this is number two if I were to set the max width to let's say 25 percent even though we stated the width should be 50 the max width is going to cap that out at 25 percent you can see that the sizes of these box have shrunk or maybe if I set a minimum width of 75 percent we're saying that each of these boxes should be at least 75 percent even though before we declared them to be 50 percent you also have Max height and Min height there's really going to be no change between the two since the height of our web page starts at the top here and ends right here we're not using all the space down below so what I propose is that let's place our boxes within a container we'll create another div with a class of container to contain our boxes let's take our two boxes and place them within this development so with my container the container class with our container let's change the background color to something great just so it's easier to see we can't see our container because our boxes are taking up all the space with our container if we need to take up the entire height of our web browser we can set the height to be 100 VH meaning viewport height so now our container is taking up 100 of the height available if I were to zoom out the container is still taking up all that space so with our boxes let's change the background color because I can't really see them that well anymore for the background let's change that to be white I'm going to zoom out to 100 percent with my minimum height property I will set the minimum height of our boxes to be 50 percent now they take up 50 of the space available which is one hundred percent our viewport height if I were to change the minimum height to be 100 we take up the entire space available or I could set the max height to be 50 percent even though we set max height to be 50 we don't necessarily need all this space because there's not enough content if I absolutely need these boxes to take up at least 50 percent of the height of my window I would use minimum height instead of maximum height so really it's up to you alright everybody so that is an introduction to the height and width properties in CSS foreign
tDqTXipQmBU,Learn HTML buttons in 5 minutes! 🔘,2023-09-21T16:51:00Z,hello again everybody today I'm going to show you how we can create a button using HTML and a little CSS to create a button we need a pair of button tags and here's our button it's really small and it doesn't do anything let's add some text between the button tags let's add some text like click me so here's our button but it's fairly small we can change the size of this button by changing the font size we will need to access the style attribute then set the font size property to a larger font size so font Dash size 25 pixels is good the size of our button will adjust accordingly let's change the background color separate each of these CSS properties with a semicolon let's change the background Dash color to be Gray so that's how to change the background color to change the font color type color colon then some color like light blue you can round the corners by setting a border radius so that's another CSS property border Dash radius colon let's begin with five that will Round the Corner slightly you can increase the amount of pixels for a more rounded border let's try 25. that's not too bad so this button currently doesn't do anything what I'm going to do is turn this button into a hyperlink when we click on the button it will take us to maybe Google we need to surround our button with a pair of a tags I will set the href attribute equal to some URL like Google so when I click on the button it takes me to Google or if we had another HTML file we can go there too I'll create a new HTML file named maybe page two page2.html let's generate some HTML in vs code to do that type an exclamation point then tab all I'm going to add to page 2 is an H1 header tag with the title of this is page number two I'll set the href attribute to B the name of that HTML file page2.html page two dot HTML when I click on the button it brings me to my second page I haven't discussed JavaScript yet but we can have a button execute some JavaScript code this part of the lesson is outside the scope of what I would normally teach at this point in time but if you're interested here's a little bit of JavaScript again it's not necessary to learn this at this level if you would like to execute some JavaScript code using a button we need a pair of script tags for JavaScript together within this pair of script Tags I'm going to define a function function you can come up with some function name this function will do something then you need a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces buttons have an on click attribute we can have the button do something if it's interacted with the on click attribute is going to be the name of my function do something when we click on the button execute this function what do we want to do I'll change some text on the screen but we'll need some sample text to work with I'll create a pair of paragraph tags let's say hello within our JavaScript function we'll change the text of whatever's between these two paragraph tags but we need an ID there's an ID attribute I'll name this text maybe greeting so when we click on this function I would like to change the text of my greeting within the function we can do that with document dot get element by ID within the set of parentheses the ID is greeting follow this with DOT inner HTML then we can set the SQL to some new value let's set the new value to be good bye now when I click on the button it changes our text so that's a button everybody you need a pair of button tags you can apply some CSS styling I haven't really discussed CSS yet so we did inline CSS but if you have these many properties I would recommend a style sheet which we'll cover later to make your button bigger you can change the font size you could have your button bring you to another HTML page or even execute some JavaScript code and well everybody that's how to create a button using HTML
WbnCll6vvw4,Learn HTML span &amp; div in 4 minutes! 🏁,2023-09-21T16:50:09Z,hey how's it going everybody today I need to explain the span and div tags in HTML the span tag is an inline container to group elements for styling purposes the div tag it's very similar except it's a block container to group elements for styling purposes here's an example let's create two H1 titles this is a span title then close it let's copy this line of markup then paste it the second line will be this is a div title I'm going to enclose my first sentence with a pair of span tags so we need an opening span tag and a closing span tag somewhere alright with this set of span tags we are enclosing this text within a container it's an inline container we can apply some CSS styling to the sentence whatever is sandwiched between the pair of span tags let's change the background color of the title I will set the style attribute to equal background Dash color then pick a color how about red than a semicolon there so the background of my title is red but you know what that red is a little bright let's do tomato I think that's a better color whatever is enclosed with a pair of span tags we can apply some inline CSS styling too now with div this creates a block level container so I will surround this sentence with a pair of div tags div meaning division let's apply that same styling I'll copy my style attribute paste it let's change the color to B maybe cyan alright here we are this is a title using span this is a title using div span is an inline container div is a block level container it takes the entire width of my document you can see that this is all blue let's create a pair of paragraph tags this is a span sentence then close it let's copy this paragraph paste it again then change the second sentence to div all right let's enclose our first sentence with a pair of span tags all right I will set the style to be red well tomato tomato color technically it's kind of like we're highlighting the text much like the mark tags in the last topic let's copy this tag change span to div then the color how about cyan and then we need to close the div tag there we are all right now let's create two large paragraphs we need a pair of paragraph tags in vs code to generate some sample text you can type lorem then tab so I will copy this line paste it again let's say after the first sentence I would like to add a background color so right here I will add a Spam tag an opening span tag then where would I like to close it let's do so before the closing paragraph tag then I will change the background color all right we have highlighted the second sentence let's do this with div tags now with our next paragraph let's create an opening div tag then we'll need to close it somewhere let's close it before the closing paragraph tag and then I will change the background color within the opening div tag I will set the background color to be cyan what we have done is created a block level element for the second sentence within our paragraph basically speaking we can use the span and div tags to group together HTML for styling purposes span is an inline container div is a block level container we'll be using these more when we reach CSS and well everybody those are the span and div tags in HTML
sm5hTFzSs5Y,Learn HTML images in 6 minutes! 🖼️,2023-09-21T16:48:47Z,hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to show you how we can add images to a web page using HTML so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody here's how to add an image to a web page but you'll need an image to work with I have a picture of a dog I'll add that to my website folder next to my index file I have a picture of a dog to add an image we'll use a self-closing image tag then set the source equal to B the name of your image including the extension mine is dog and this is a PNG file so this picture is fairly large you can change the dimensions with the height or width attributes I'll set the height to be 200 200 pixels now the width will adjust automatically however you could change that too if you wanted if I need this image to be a perfect square I will also set the width to be 200 however this does compress the image depending on the dimensions of your original picture you may need to change the height and or width I'll set the height to be 200 though then keep the width the same it'll adjust automatically now for some reason if your image isn't displaying let's say that I get the file extension wrong I'll say that this is a JPEG well the image won't display you can add alternative text with the alt attribute the alternative text you could say anything this is a picture of a dog this image doesn't display you at least display the alternative text now the nice thing about the alt attribute is that if somebody is visually impaired and they're using a screen reader the screen reader will read this alt description just to test my screen reader I'm going to add some text before and after this image as well let's add an H1 header tag this is a cute dog then I'll add some text after I'll use an H3 header tag woof woof I'll use my screen reader this is an extension on Chrome you can download my first website this is a cute dog this is a picture of a dog woof woof the screen reader read the alternative text for this image so it is good practice if you include an image to write a brief description of the image another cool thing you can do with images is that you can't turn them into hyperlinks I will surround our image element with a pair of a tags a meaning anchor then I will set the href attribute equal to a URL I'll find the Wikipedia page for dogs all right I'll copy this URL then I will set the href attribute to be this URL when I click on this image it takes me to the Wikipedia page for dogs so yeah you can turn an image into a hyperlink another cool thing you can do too is that you can include gifs in your web page this is my gift that I'll include I'll add that to my website folder I'll include a self-closing image tag set the source equal to B the name of my image then be sure to get the file extension right this is a gif I'll set the height attribute to be maybe 200 as well height equals 200. then I'll add some alternative text alt attribute will be smiling dog gif now with a website you may have all of your images within a separate folder like this I'll go to new folder I'll create a folder named images then I will move my images to the images folder so my images are no longer being displayed we have our alternative text this is a picture of a dog and smiling dog gif with your Source attribute we're using a relative file path we need to navigate to the images folder then find the appropriate image files I'm going to precede these images with the name of the folder they are found within the images folder you may also need another forward slash for me either work let's move on to an exercise in the last few videos we were working on a web page for song lyrics Let's include some album art for my song that I picked I have a picture of the original album art that this song is found from I will move that to my website folder then I will move it to the images folder within my website folder I need a self-closing image tag set the source equal to B we need to navigate to the images folder I will list that first Images slash the name of the file for me it's album cover dot jpeg then I'll change the dimensions I will set the height equal to B 200. I'll add some alternative text alt equals album art cover then a line break maybe two then I'll turn this into a hyperlink as well I will surround our image with a pair of a tags I will set the href attribute to be the original YouTube video where you can find this song so href equals the YouTube video that I linked before so this should take me to YouTube there we are all right everybody well that's how to include an image on a web page using HTML
BAx2GaMW2qA,Learn HTML video in 4 minutes! 🎥,2023-09-21T16:49:19Z,hey what's going on everybody today I'm going to show you how we can include a video in your web page using HTML all right let's get started everybody in this example you'll need a video file of one of a few formats you can use either an mp4 file webm or vorbis OGG I just so happen to have an mp4 file of me playing that new Zelda game Zelda tears of the Kingdom this is just some sample footage once you have your video file you're going to take it and place it right next to your index file within your website folder to include a video you'll need a pair of video tags within the opening video tag we can set a source attribute to B either the relative file path or the absolute file path of that video These two files are right next to each other I only need the file name my file is zelda.mp4 and there's my video but it's humongous we can change the height and or the width let's change the width to be 500 pixels that's a good size the height will adjust accordingly or vice versa if I were to change the height to be 500 then the width is going to adjust accordingly but let's keep it as 500. here's our video but there's no way to play it we'll need to add a set of controls with the controls attribute now we can play the video to have this video autoplay when the page loads you can set the autoplay property it should play automatically but if it is set to auto play you should at least mute it because people can find it annoying especially if this video is loud let's add the muted attribute so now it auto plays and it's muted to have this video Loop when it's done let me fast forward to the end I can add the loop attribute now it should Loop when it reaches the end right about here yeah and it's back to the beginning again just in case somebody's web browser doesn't support this video file you can add backups I also happen to have a webm version of the same video I'll place it within my website folder then within the pair of video tags we will add a source element take our source attribute cut it then paste it within the source element you can keep all the attributes within the opening video tag you should also tell the web browser what type of video file this is video slash MP4 now to include a backup we just need to use the source element again as a backup in case a web browser can't play my mp4 file we'll instead use the webm version zelda.webm the type is web m alright so let me delete the MP4 version to test it let's save and reload everything and now my webm version is playing you can't really tell the difference you also have the capability of turning this video into a hyperlink I will surround my video element with a pair of a tags then I will set the href attribute to some URL I'll set it to be the Wikipedia page for Zelda feel free to pick any page of your choosing with the href attribute I will paste that URL now when I click on this video it should bring me to the Legend of Zelda Wikipedia page to open this link I get it link because it's Legend of Zelda anyways to open this link in a new tab I can set the target attribute to be underscore blank then it should open in a new tab which it does all right everybody so that's how to include a video in your web page using HTML
2oCN2q1x3c4,HTML tutorial for beginners 🌎,2023-09-21T16:39:31Z,hey how's it going everybody in this series I'm going to show you everything you need to know to get started working with HTML then a little bit later on we'll cover CSS so why don't you go ahead and sit back relax and enjoy the show hey if you enjoy my videos please be sure to subscribe because subscribing is free just like how this video is free help me out yes I'm guilt tripping you that is all why should you learn HTML in today's age people spend way too much time on the internet myself included unfortunately knowing how to create or otherwise manage a website isn't a bad thing to know heck add it to your resume it really can't hurt even if you're not interested in web development as a career almost every business has some sort of online presence knowing how to manage that online presence could convince a potential employer to hire you over somebody else so why not HTML is an acronym for hypertext markup language the general idea is that certain types of tags also known as markup is used to convey to a web browser how some content should be displayed usually tags are in pairs with some content sandwiched between them header tags are typically used for titles P tags are used for paragraphs of text a tags are used for hyperlinks HTML adds structure to a web page if we were building a house you could say that HTML is the foundation the skeletal structure to support all content on a website then their CSS CSS means cascading style sheets it's a language that adds style to a web page in our house analogy CSS would be equivalent to the decorations design and colors of the Interior to begin working with HTML and CSS you'll need a modern web browser you can use Google Chrome Firefox Microsoft Edge Safari those are all fine you'll also need a text editor as well such as vs code it's free software that functions as a workbench for us to write code in this next part I'll show you how we can download and install vs code to download vs code head to this website code.visualstudio.com look for whatever operating system you're using and download that version I'm running Windows I will download the windows version then I will open it when it's done accept the agreement yes I did read it that fast next I'll create a desktop icon next install launch Visual Studio code and finish we need a folder to hold all of the documents related to our website go to Open folder I'll place this folder on my desktop new folder I'll name this folder website select folder there we go we are now within our website folder I'm going to create a new file I will name this file index.html whatever your home page is going to be I would recommend naming it index.html most servers return the index file as the home page so it would be good practice for us to name the home page index now what we're going to do is install the live server extension go to extensions look up live server and install basically what this does is that when you update your HTML file if you have a web browser open it's going to update automatically it'll save you some time all right everybody now what we're gonna do is fill in our HTML file at the top what we'll do is add a set of angle brackets then type this exclamation point doc type HTML this is a declaration that this document is an HTML5 document which is the most recent version then we'll create a pair of HTML tags we'll need an opening HTML tag and an ending HTML tag you can tell that this is an ending tag because it has a forward slash most tags are in groups of pairs that's if there's typically content between them this pair of HTML tags represents the root element of an HTML page between these two tags we will add a pair of head tags the head element contains information about your web page such as a title let's add a title to our web page title add a closing tag let's set the title of our web page to be my first website now what we'll do right click on your HTML file then open with live server here's our webpage the title says my first website just to make this easier on us I'm going to place our web page side by side with vs code when we save any changes we can see that update automatically the head element contains information about your web page whereas in the body let's add a pair of body tags after the pair of head tags the body element contains visible content in your web page between our body tags let's add a pair of H1 header tags H1 defines a large heading I'll add some text this is an H1 heading I'm going to save that should update my HTML document automatically this is an H1 heading let's try H2 add a pair of H2 header tags this is an H2 heading let's do H3 H3 this is an H3 heading H4 this is an H4 heading then we have H5 this is an H5 heading typically header tags are used for titles or other large text let's discuss paragraph tags if you have a paragraph of text you can place that within a pair of P tags thumb text goes here if you need some sample text to work with if you're using vs code you can type lorem then tab this will create some garbage text for you I think it's supposed to resemble Latin if I were to copy everything within the set of paragraph tags then save it paragraphs are separated with a line break otherwise if you do need a line break you can type BR meaning line break so this is a self-closing tag pairs of tags usually have some sort of content between them with the line break that's a self-closing tag we don't need a closing tag so add as many line breaks as you need wherever you need them so that's a line break there's also a horizontal rule which is HR think Human Resources HR that would add a horizontal line across your page that might look pretty good after a title paragraph tags don't care about any spaces or new lines I'm going to put all of this on separate lines just so it's more legible so when I save nothing appears to happen even if I were to add some line breaks between these sentences nothing appears to change you could always change your paragraph tags to pre meaning pre-formatted as in pre-formatted text that would retain any line breaks or spaces Within These tags it's up to you if you prefer the P tags or the pre-tags now the last thing I'm going to discuss are comments comments aren't displayed as output they're usually used as notes for yourself or for other developers you would type a left angle bracket exclamation point two dashes wherever your comment ends you would type two dashes right angle bracket this is a comment so when I save nothing appears to happen comments are used for yourself or for other developers that are looking over this document alright everybody well at this time let's go over an exercise just so that we have a solid foundation and really remember everything it'd be good practice for us we're going to create a separate HTML file that displays the lyrics of a song you like so let's create a new HTML file let's name this file lyrics dot HTML again we'll need to add this declaration doc type HTML that's a declaration that this document is an HTML5 document then we'll need a pair of HTML tags we'll need a head element and a body let's add a title to the head of our document title let's set the title to be my song lyrics then we will open this HTML file with live server my song lyrics pick a song that you like within our body tags let's add an H1 element this will be the title copy the name of your song place it within this pair of tags so that's the title add song by the name of the band or artist I'll use H3 header tags that's slightly smaller than H1 you know maybe H4 I think that'd be better I'll add a horizontal rule that's HR I'll add a pair of P tags take all of these lyrics copy them and paste them within the pair of P tags I'd like to retain the spacing let's change the P tags to pre tags for pre-formatted text that's much better let's add one line break after our horizontal rule one last thing I'm going to do within the pre-tags I'm going to add some blank lines between some of these verses there we go that's pretty cool I think we have the hang of basic HTML now in the next topic we'll discuss hyperlinks hey if you're enjoying this series so far please be sure to support me by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below

c2M-rlkkT5o,Learn MongoDB in 1 hour 🍃,2023-04-14T17:40:13Z,hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in today's video I'm going to teach you everything you need to know to get started using mongodb in about an hour so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey if you'd like free stuff you should probably subscribe because I release free courses every once in a while when I feel like it that is all what the heck is mongodb it's a no SQL database management system that can manage a humongous amount of data and it's becoming increasingly popular it's favored by many big tech companies unlike relational database Management Systems mongodb uses a nosql format to store and retrieve data nosql means not only SQL it's where data is stored in various formats besides a traditional SQL table rather than storing our data in rows and columns with the table using SQL we store related data as a single document think of each document as a single row and a table in SQL data in each document is stored as field value pairs similar to a Json format but it's technically bsawn binary JavaScript object notation but it behaves very similar similarly for all intents and purposes the general idea is that data which is frequently accessed together is stored together rather than in Separate Tables because SQL joins quite frankly are a pain in the ass this is how our nosql database is arranged we have a document a document is a group of field value pairs to represent an object a collection is a group of one or more documents and a database is a group of one or more collections this makes working with and scaling our database like really really easy before we do begin there are a few prerequisites for this series we will be working with document objects I would recommend at least some experience with an object-oriented programming language of your choosing it doesn't matter if it's python Java C plus plus C sharp JavaScript doesn't matter just pick one so let's get started I will show you what you need to download all right let's get started everybody here is the installation process for mongodb so go to this website mongodb.com go to resources server on the left sidebar go to installation here's a list of different installation tutorials depending on your operating system I'm running Windows I'll select Windows let's scroll down we're looking for install mongodb Community Edition all you have to do is follow the numbered steps beginning with one we will go to the download Center I'll open this in a new tab because I don't want to close out of this window select the current version select your platform again I'm running Windows and the installation package I'll keep that the same and download pick a place to save the installer to I'll keep it within my documents folder but you choose your own place and I will open this when it's done so we're going to click next accept the license agreement next complete install mongod as a service make sure that's checked next also be sure to install the mongodb compass program it's a graphical user interface then give it a couple minutes now that mongodb is installed we can finish this may open compass compass is a graphical user interface for managing our database we'll be using Compass intermittently in fact I recommend creating a desktop shortcut you just have to open it then to establish a connection you hit the green connect button I'll be using Compass intermittently just to show you how everything works let's also install the mongodb shell to install the shell we're going to go to the left sidebar and where is it there mongodb shell also known as mangosh like oh my gosh we are going to go to the download Center select the current version select your platform I'm running Windows and the package will keep that the same and download we'll open this when it's done we will unzip this folder so right click extract all we will need the file path to the executable let's open this folder go to bin and we can copy this file location let's right click on our executable go to properties copy this file location it should be within the bin folder then we're going to add that file path to our environment variables really we can just search for environment variables we're within system properties go to the advanced tab environment variables underneath system variables let's pretend that this wasn't here click new come up with a variable name sh is good then paste that file location hit okay and close so if we go to that folder and open the executable this is the mongodb shell I'm going to make the font size a little bit bigger to establish a connection to our database type sh and that should establish a connection to clear your screen type CLS to exit type exit personally I don't like using this executable by itself I like using vs code if you would like to use vs code for using the Shell here's how if you would like to use vs code for using the Shell here's how So within vs code we're going to download the mongodb extension so go to extensions search for mongodb it should be this one we will install this extension there should be a new icon for mongodb let's click on it to establish a connection we just have to click on localhost the mongodb connection was successful then to open our terminal right click launch mongodb shell let's minimize this close out of this window pull up this terminal we are utilizing the mongodb Shell with vs code so to exit you type exit to establish a connection you can type  sh to clear your screen you can type CLS and that is everything you need to know to get started everybody here's how we can create and use databases in mongodb to show all databases type show DBS that will give you a list of all current databases I have three admin config and local to use a database type use then select a database name to use admin I can say use admin we have switched to dbadmin now if you use a database that doesn't exist let's say we will create a database for a school use school that's how you can create a database we are now within a new database named School however if I were to show my current databases my school database doesn't show up it's not visible because it's empty we'll need to fill it with something let's add a collection to our school to do that type DB dot we will use the create collection method this method ends with a set of parentheses just like a function or method in typical programming languages within the set of parentheses we are going to pass in an argument for a name for this collection let's create a collection of students and we are returned with OK we have created one new collection let's clear our screen show our databases again show DBS and here is our new database of school currently we are within our school database as you can see next to my cursor to drop this current database you can type DB dot drop database method and our database is dropped let's show our databases again and our school database is no longer there that is how to use create and drop a database in the mongodb Shell if you would like to use Compass here's how we have our three default databases admin config local to create a database you can click this green button we'll need a database name let's say school again we will create a collection of students within our database you can add additional preferences but we'll cover that later we will create our database and here's our database of school there is one collection of students but students doesn't have any documents yet which we'll cover in the next topic to delete a database in mongodb compass select a database from the sidebar then hit the trash can icon to delete it type the name of the database to drop the database so make sure that the name of the database is typed then drop database and that is how to use create and drop a database in mongodb compass all right we're moving on everybody now I'm gonna show you how we can insert documents into a mongodb database let's be sure that we're using our current database in the last topic we were using the database of school let's clear our screen to insert a document within the database we're working with type DB then the name of a collection if a collection is found within this database we have created a collection of students if this collection doesn't exist one will be created for you db.students.we will use the insert one method within the set of parentheses we will place a document which is enclosed within a set of curly braces within the set of curly braces we can list as many field value pairs as we would like let's create a name field with the value of SpongeBob each field value pair is comma separated let's add another field value pair maybe an age age will be 30. then a GPA grade point average SpongeBob has a solid 3.2 GPA let's enter this command that was acknowledged to return all documents within a collection type DB the name of the collection in this case students dot we can use the find method here are the current documents within my collection we only have one here's the object ID that's created automatically the name is SpongeBob age 30 GPA 3.2 now you can insert more than one document at a time by using the insert menu function DB type the name of the collection students in this case we will insert many documents we will place all documents to be inserted within an array add a set of straight brackets this is the exact same kind of array from different programming languages however in Python I think that would be a list technically maybe we need to insert three documents we would need three sets of curly braces each comma separated within each set of curly braces we would list all of the different field value pairs so let's begin with the first we have name Patrick separate each field value pair with a comma then we have age of let's make Patrick 38 then GPA Patrick is at 1.5 that's enough for our first document let's go to the second document move over to the second set of curly braces for the name this will be Sandy Sandy's age is I don't know 27 sounds good GPA Sandy smart she has a solid 4.0 then let's go to the last document name maybe Gary 's age is 18. GPA 2.5 that's good enough for now this array contains several documents each document is enclosed within a set of curly braces within each document you can have as many field value pairs as you like they all don't need to be consistent let's insert all of these documents they were all acknowledged we have three new object IDs let's use the find method again to display all of them DB dot students dot find here are the four objects found within our database SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Gary that's how to insert documents using the Shell next we'll do the same thing but use Compass instead if you're using Compass here's how to insert documents into a collection here are the four documents we created previously I'm just going to go ahead and delete these to add a new document make sure you're within the current database you're working with go to the current collection RS students we will add data you can import a Json or CSV file or you can type them manually by inserting document a document is pre-generated for you I'm just going to go ahead and delete that we'll Begin by inserting SpongeBob you need a set of curly braces then list all of the name value pairs name SpongeBob separate each field value pair with a comma age 30. GPA 3.2 if you have this warning you will need to probably hit the format button that should go away then insert and that is how to insert one document to insert many it's the same process as before but you're going to enclose all of your documents within an array a set of straight brackets so if we need three documents add three sets of curly braces all comma separated we had Patrick age I think he was 38. GPA 1.5 name Sandy age 27 I'm going to move this down a little bit so you can see GPA 4.0 then name Gary age 18. GPA 2.5 let's reformat insert and here are the three documents we have inserted all right and that is how to insert documents into a mongodb database using Compass all right everybody it's about time I discuss some basic data types in mongodb we will Begin by inserting a new document into our students collection db.students.insert1 we're inserting a document add a set of curly braces the first data type I'll discuss is a string suppose we have a field of name a string is a series of text within quotes these can be either double quotes or single quotes but typically I like to put them within double quotes a string is a series of text like a name Like Larry strings can contain spaces we could enter in a first name space then a last name Larry Lobster they can also contain numbers larry123 however in a string we treat the numbers differently we read the Morris characters rather than actual numbers so let's stick with name Larry that's a string it's a series of characters then we have integers and integer is a whole number let's create a field for age Larry will be 32. whole integers don't contain decimal portions it wouldn't make sense to enter in 32.5 we don't really keep track of people's half birthdays and stuff so age would be a whole number those are integers whole numbers then we have doubles a double is a number that contains a decimal portion maybe a grade point average grade point averages typically contain decimals Larry has a 2.8 GPA it's a double because there's a decimal portion integers are whole numbers doubles are numbers that contain a decimal then we have booleans booleans are either true or they're false it's kind of like a light switch it's only on or off there's only two states let's create a field for full time is the student full time this can be either true or false Larry is too busy working out all the time he is a part-time student not a full-time student we'll set that field to be false date objects are pretty popular in mongodb suppose we have a registration date register date to create a date object you can use the new keyword followed by a call to the date Constructor if you don't pass any arguments to the date Constructor you'll use the current time in the UTC time zone otherwise you can pass a date and time like 2023 January 2nd you could add a time too but we'll just stick with the current date and time that's assigned to us those are date objects the next data type is null null means no value I'll create a field for a graduation date and I will set that to be null Larry is a current student but we don't know when he's going to graduate all we're really doing is creating a placeholder we don't have a date yet so we can set that to be null that's to be filled in later so null means no value then we have arrays much like in modern programming languages is kind of like a variable that has more than one value but in mongodb we have a field that can have more than one value let's create a field of courses what courses is Larry enrolled in place all values within a set of straight brackets let's insert multiple values what courses is Larry in maybe he's in biology these values are all comma separated chemistry then calculus so that's an array they're all enclosed within a set of square brackets they allow one field to contain multiple values then we have nested documents this would be good for an address to create a nested document you use a set of curly braces within the nested document we can list some field value pairs how about a street let's come up with a street name one two three fake street is good than a city Bikini Bottom and a zip code one two three four five it is possible to have documents within documents which is what we did with the address let's enter everything to see if it works yeah that was acknowledged let's head to Compass refresh and here is Larry name Larry h32 GPA 2.8 full time is set to false he's a part-time student here is Larry's registration date and time we're using the UTC time zone his graduation date is set to null all of his courses that he's in is stored within an array and his address is stored as a nested document alright everybody and those are a few basic data types you should know in mongodb all right everybody today I'm going to show you how we can both sort and limit documents in mongodb to return all documents we can type DB the name of the collection dot then we can use the find method to return all documents to sort these documents in some sort of order again we would type DB the name of the collection students dot find method then we'll do some method chaining after the find method add dot then we will call the sort method the sort method takes a document by which field would we like to sort let's sort names in alphabetical order we would type the name of the field Name colon then one for alphabetical order or negative one for reverse alphabetical order so if we were to sort by alphabetical order here's the results we have Gary then Larry Patrick Sandy SpongeBob then reverse alphabetical order that was Name colon negative one now we have SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary let's sort our documents by GPA grade point average so again we use the find method then we'll method chain the sort method we're passing in a document object with our criteria we will sort by GPA in ascending order so we will use one I'm going to copy this because I'm going to use it later okay now we're sorting by GPA Patrick has the lowest GPA 1.5 2.5 2.8 3.2 then 4. to sort our GPA by deciding order we would type GPA negative one then we have Sandy at the top with the gpf4 then SpongeBob with 3.2 2.8 2.5 1.5 now we have the limit method we can limit the amount of documents that are returned to us let's type DB dot students dot find method dot limit method we will pass the number of documents we would like return to us as an argument if I would like one document returned to us I will pass in one currently my documents are sorted by object ID this would give us the first document of SpongeBob if I were to use limit 3 we would be returned three documents SpongeBob Patrick Sandy we can combine both the sort and the limit methods too I would like to return the student with the highest GPA we'll use the find method then method chain the sort method we are sorting by GPA we're going to sort in decreasing order so negative one followed by the limit method I would like just one document who has the highest GPA that would be Sandy with a GPA of four who has the lowest GPA we should sort an increasing order that would be one then limit one so Patrick has the lowest GPA of 1.5 now let's work with sorting and limiting Encompass to sort the documents in your collection you can press more options then add some sort criteria I will sort by name colon one then find so we have Gary Larry Patrick Sandy SpongeBob then negative one for reverse alphabetical order SpongeBob Sandy Patrick Larry Gary let's sort by GPA GPA negative one that would give us decreasing order so Sandy's at the top to limit the amount of documents that are returned you can enter in a number for the limit box I will limit the records to one so we are returned with Sandy she has the highest GPA limit three would give us the top three students or leave limit MDU to return all documents all right everybody so that is basic sorting and limiting in mongodb hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the find method in mongodb to use the find a method type DB the name of the collection you're working with then add the find method that will return all documents within this collection but at times you might not want all documents you might want specific documents here's how we will add some arguments to the find method DB Dot students.find the first argument is a document object the parameter is the query parameter it specifies selection filters maybe you just need one student well you would just list that criteria here I would like any students with the name of SpongeBob that would return any document where the first name is SpongeBob that would return everybody that has that name I'm just going to copy this let's find any students that have a GPA of 4.0 within our document the search filter is GPA 4.0 that would give us Sandy let's find if any students are not full-time full time I will set that to be false there is one student Larry full time is set to false the query parameter is very similar to a where clause in SQL you can even use more than one filter search for any student that has a GPA of 4.0 each filter is comma separated as well as full-time being true with my data set this does not return any results but to add more than one filter they're comma separated within a document body with the find method there is a second parameter that is the projection parameter we would pass another document body they're each comma separated if you don't specify the query parameter you would just return all documents with the projection parameter you can return specific Fields maybe you don't want all the information that's available perhaps I would just like each Student's name so we would set the field to be true you can use one as well but my own preference is true just because it's more readable return every document but only give their name and here they are mongodb will give you the ID regardless you can set that to be false within the projection parameter underscore ID false I just want everybody's name there we are SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Gary Larry let's get every student's name as well as their GPA so ID I will set that to be false I don't want that name will be true I would like that GPA will also be true I would like that here is every student's name as well as their GPA so that's the projection parameter if there's a field you would like or don't want you can set that to be either true or false when you display your data all right let's do the same thing with compass with compass this text box is for the find method So within a set of curly braces I would like to find any name that's SpongeBob then press find that returns one result return any student with the GPA of 4.0 that's Sandy return any students that are not full-time full-time is false that gives us Larry now if you go to more options there is a projection parameter if you only want some data let's find every student but for the projection parameter I would only like their name I'll set that to be true and their GPA that's true as well again that still gives us the ID let's set that to be false if you don't want that ID false and that should get rid of the ideas here's each Student's name and their GPA all right everybody that's the find method two optional parameters that we can send arguments to are the query parameter that's selection criteria it's similar to a where clause in SQL we're trying to limit the results and the projection parameter that's similar to selected columns in SQL you're looking for specific Fields alright everybody and that is the find method in mongodb well hello again everybody today I will be explaining how we can update documents in mongodb to do that we would type DB the name of the collection we're working with in this case students we can either update one document or update many let's update one we will use the update 1 method there are two parameters set up filter and update filter is the selection criteria for the update So within a set of curly braces we will pass some criteria let's update anybody's name that's SpongeBob it's basically just selection criteria the second parameter it's another document body is the update parameter what are the modifications we would like to apply we will utilize the set operator which is preceded with the dollar sign the set operator replaces the value of a field so after the set operator add a colon then another set of curly braces yes there's a lot of curly braces in mongodb So within this set of curly braces after the set operator that's where we can make our changes you can add or change the value of a field Spongebob doesn't have a full time field we can add that with the set operator if this field already exists we would update it so let's say SpongeBob is a full-time student let's execute this command it was acknowledged that's true we have a matched count of one and a modified count of one let's take a look at Spongebob DB dot students dot find name SpongeBob and here he is he is now a full-time student with your filter argument if you're working with a large data set it is possible that two people can have the same name it would be safer if we were to update by an object ID these IDs are unique for each document let's update but with the filter we will search by object ID so again that's DB dot students dot update one first is the filter parameter within a document body let's select underscore ID colon then paste that object ID for SpongeBob for every document the object ID is unique just in case there's two people named SpongeBob we won't update it looks like I have double underscore ID let me fix that real quick otherwise we'll get a syntax error so select the document that has this object ID then the second argument which is comma separated will be the changes to be made so we will set colon another set of curly braces let's set full time to be false SpongeBob already Works a full-time job he'll just be a part-time student okay that was acknowledged let's take a look at Spongebob again using the find method db.students.find ID colon the unique object ID and here's SpongeBob the full-time field is set to false before it was true but we updated it now you can unset a field too let's get rid of the full time field for SpongeBob DB dot students dot update one we will search by ID then for the second argument we will use the unset operator which will remove a field so within another set of curly braces let's take our full time field colon now to remove a field for the value just set it to be an empty string let's take a look that was acknowledged let's select SpongeBob again db.students.find all right and here's SpongeBob again that full-time field is gone now you can use the unset operator to remove a field now let's talk about update many using the update many method we can update many documents at once DB dot students.update many this method has the same parameters as update 1. if I would like to select every document I will use an empty set of curly braces what are the changes we would like to make let's use the set operator let's set everybody's full-time field to be false if they don't have this field one will be created for them all right let's find every student that was acknowledged db.students.find everybody everybody should have a full-time field that's set to false full time is false here as well yeah and that applies to everybody all right let's unset the full-time field for Gary and Sandy TV DOT students.update one let's select name Gary we will use the unset operator then add the changes to be made full time then we'll remove it by placing an empty string I'm going to copy this line we'll reuse it later that was acknowledged then let's remove full time for Sandy that was acknowledged as well so let's double check DB dot students dot find so SpongeBob and Patrick both have this full-time field Sandy and Gary don't they were unset with the update many method we can check to see if a field exists or doesn't exist within the selection criteria if any student doesn't have a full time field let's update it DB dot students.update many what is the selection criteria let's say the selection criteria is full time field does it not exist we will use the exists operator exists preceded with the dollar sign then add false does this full-time field not exist that's the selection criteria if a document doesn't have the full-time field we'll give them one so the second argument will be the changes to be made we will use the set operator colon another set of curly braces anybody that doesn't have the full-time field let's set that to be true full time true press enter that was acknowledged let's take a look at our students db.students.find all right so Sandy and Gary are both full-time students now SpongeBob Patrick and Larry are not full-time students they're part-time students that's how to update documents in the mongodb Shell you can use update 1 or update many let's do the same thing with compass hello again everybody in compass to update a field of a document you can press the pencil icon to edit the document to remove a field next to the field name you can press the trash can icon to remove it then update to add a field go to the pencil icon again after a field you can add a new field by pressing the plus button to add a field let's add a full time field for the value I will set that to be false for SpongeBob then you can change the data type here we'll change that to be a Boolean then update to change a pre-existing field again go to the pencil icon select your field then you can change one of the values but I'll keep this as false that is how to update documents in compass it's fairly easy and straightforward alright everybody so that is how to update documents in mongodb you can use the update 1 method or update many you pass in a filter for the selection criteria then the modifications within the update parameter and that is how to update documents in mongodb hello again friends it's me again today I will be explaining how we can delete documents in mongodb before we do begin this lesson I recommend exporting your collection we'll be deleting documents adding them back in is kind of a pain in the ass unless we're importing them so let's export our collection export query with filters that's fine select output you can export as a Json file or as a CSV file let's export our collection as a Json file you can also select a destination I'll place this file on my desktop just for convenience and export we'll be importing this Json file at the end of this lesson and close within Compass to delete a document all you do is press the trash can icon then delete it's really easy in compass in the Shell it's a little different in the Shell to delete a document type DB dot the name of the collection students then there's delete one or delete many we'll begin with delete one we have one parameter a filter parameter it's very similar to the find method we list some criteria to search for let's delete anybody with the name of Larry that was acknowledged the delete account is one let's find our studentsdb.students.find and Larry is no longer at the bottom we have Patrick Sandy and Gary remaining we can use delete many to delete more than one document DB dot students dot delete many pass in our criteria anybody that has a full-time field set to false will delete so we have deleted one person that matches this criteria DV dot students dot find we have deleted Patrick we can delete any documents that are missing a field or if a field does exist we can delete that let's delete any document that is missing a registration date DB dot students dot delete many we are checking if there is a registration date field does this field not exist if it doesn't then delete that document we will use the exists operator colon false if this field doesn't exist delete that document so we have deleted two documents if we take a look at our students now db.students.find we no longer have any students so that's how to delete one or many documents with the mongodb shell now if we head back to compass then refresh we have no more students let's import our collection that we exported because we do need some data for this series add data import Json or CSV file we are looking for our students Json file select and import and we're done so that is how to delete documents in mongodb hey everyone today I need to explain comparison operators operators are denoted with the dollar sign comparison operators return data based on value comparisons in previous examples we would type db.students.find then list some criteria like if we're looking for SpongeBob we would say a name SpongeBob now what if you would like to find everybody but SpongeBob well you can use the not equals comparison operator we would enclose it within a document body pre-seed our value with the not equal comparison operator dollar sign and E colon find every name that's not SpongeBob that gives us four records Patrick Sandy Gary Larry SpongeBob isn't within here that is the not equals comparison operator return every document that has a name not equal to SpongeBob let's go over a few more let's cover less than and less than equals two DB dot students dot find everybody that has an age that is less than so dollar sign LT for less than 20. that gives us one document Gary who's 18. or we could use less than equal to change LT to LTE that means R20 is inclusive uh maybe let's change this to 27. return every document where the age field is less than or equal to 27 that would give us two results Sandy who's 27 exactly and Gary who's 18. let's do greater than return every document where age is greater than 27. that gives us three documents SpongeBob who's 30. Patrick who's 38 Larry who's 32. let's do greater than equals that would be GTE find everybody that's greater than or equal to 27. that gives us four records SpongeBob Patrick Sandy who's 27 exactly and Larry so that's less than less than equals to greater than and greater than equals to you can use more than one comparison operator to find values within a certain range let's find every student whose GPA is between three and four DB that's students dot find we are searching for GPA let's use the greater than equals to comparison operator return every GPA that's greater than three comma and less than or equal to four so these would be the students that have a good GPA SpongeBob and Sandy SpongeBob has a GPA of 3.2 Sandy's is 4.0 you can use more than one comparison operator to give you a range now another good operator is the in operator with the in operator we can return all records that have one of these matching values so db.students.find let's find any student whose name is within this array we will pass in a document body use the in operator colon then list an array an array of values let's find anybody whose name is either SpongeBob Patrick or Sandy So within an array we will list our values return anybody whose name is SpongeBob Patrick or Sandy there SpongeBob Patrick Sandy with the in logical operator you will return all documents where one of the values in this array is found within this field you can also use not in which is nin so let's copy this line clear our screen paste it change in to nin not in return all documents where name doesn't have one of these values that would give us Gary and Larry we are given everybody's name that's not SpongeBob Patrick or Sandy let's switch to Compass and I'll show you how we can do the same thing within Compass you would write your filter within this text box return everybody who has a GPA field that is greater than or equal to three GTE three that gives us SpongeBob and Sandy give us everybody who is let's say age is less than 27. that gives us Gary all right everybody so in conclusion comparison operators return data based on value comparisons and those are comparison operators in mongodb hey everybody today I need to explain logical operators logical operators return data based on Expressions that evaluate to be true or false there's four and or nor and not let's begin with and using the and logical operator we can check to see if two expressions are true let's begin with DB dot students that's the name of the collection we'll use the find method pass in a document object we will use the and logical operator it's preceded with the dollar sign it's an operator then a colon whatever Expressions you would like to check you will place within an array list as many Expressions as you would like let's return any document where the student is a full-time student and their 22 years or younger usually most students when they start college they're between the ages of 18 and 22. so let's find all those students we'll have two conditions we need two document bodies our first condition is full time true give me any student that's a full-time student and our other condition is give me any student that's age is less than or equal to 22. we'll use the less than equals comparison operator colon 22 and that's it we have one student Gary he's 22 and under and a full-time student so with the andological operator you can have more than one condition this condition needs to be true and that condition needs to be true we were given the results of Gary He's the only student that passes these two filters they both evaluated to be true let's copy this method we'll reuse it let's discuss or change and to or with the or logical operator at least one of these conditions need to be true give me anybody that's a full-time student or anybody that's 22 or younger that will give me two documents Sandy she's older than 22 but she's a full-time student Gary is 22 and under and a full-time student so with the or logical operator at least one condition needs to be true so again let's copy this method we'll reuse it then we will talk about nor so with the neurological operator nor we will return any document where these conditions are false this needs to be false as well as this needs to be false it's kind of like and but instead of both conditions being true it's the opposite they both need to be false so that would give me three results SpongeBob he's above 22 he's a part-time student Patrick is 38 he's a part-time student Larry he's 32 he's a part-time student with the neurological operator we need both of these conditions to be false that gave us these three documents for SpongeBob Patrick and Larry lastly we have not suppose I have this query db.students.find any student that is not above 30. I could write something like this age colon will use the less than comparison operator colon 30. find any student under 30. normally this would give me Sandy and Gary you know this does work but what if somebody doesn't have some information for their age like let's change Gary's age to null because in SpongeBob lore Gary is a pet snail his age is in cat years just to make this easy and Compass I'm going to edit Gary's age to be null let's write that query again give me any student whose age is less than 30. well that only gives me Sandy Gary's age is null so another way in which we could return all students that are not 30 or above we can use the not logical operator the not logical operator reverses what you're looking for so let's enclose this document body within another document body then we will use the dollar sign not logical operator but we will change the comparison operator to be greater than equals give me any student that is not greater than or equal to 30. so that should give me both Sandy and Gary even though Gary's age is null in many circumstances you could use less than but a benefit of the not to logical operator is that it would give you null values return any document that doesn't fit this condition basically speaking not just does the opposite alright everybody so those are logical operators they return data based on Expressions that evaluate to be true or false and those are logical operators in mongodb hey everybody today we are moving on to indexes and index allows for the quick lookup of a field however it takes up more memory and slows insert update and remove operations use them wisely utilizing an index if you're familiar with data structures and algorithms we are storing our data as a b tree if there's a field you search for but you don't do many updates I would recommend an index here's an example let's find any students named larrydb dot students dot find find anybody named Larry I'm going to make one adjustment though let's method chain the explain method and pass in this string execution stats that will give me the execution stats of this query I have five documents within my collection we have examined five documents to find Larry we're performing a linear search through our collection we're examining each document one by one I only have five documents that wouldn't take too long imagine I have thousands or hundreds of thousands of documents well a linear search is going to take a really long time we can speed up the lookup process by applying an index to apply an index to a field you would type something like this DB dot the name of the collection dot create index now what field would you like to apply an index for let's apply an index to our name field name called in you can arrange the data in your index in ascending order by using one or descending order with negative one so with a name one would be alphabetical starting with a to z let's hit enter this is the name of our index name underscore one let's perform that query one more time DB dot students dot find anybody named Larry name Larry then we will method chain the explain method pass in the string execution stats let's see what the results are this time we only examined one document examining one document is a lot less time consuming than examining five documents like I said I have a small data set it doesn't appear to make that big of a difference but if you have hundreds of thousands of documents it's going to save you a lot of time to get all your indexes you can use the get indexes method db.students dot get indexes and we have two there already is an index applied to object ideas we have that by default and here's the index we created to look up names quickly we have two indexes technically to drop an index you'll need the name let's copy that DB dot students dot drop index place the name of the index within the drop index method and our index is dropped let's take a look at our indexes again db.student.getindexes and our index is gone now if you would like to create an index in compass you go to the indexes tab create index select a type or field name let's create an index for name select a type let's place our name in ascending order you can select more options but that's a little Advanced for us at this level let's begin with the basics and that's how to create an index in compass then to drop the index you just press this trash can icon type the index name underscore one and that's how to drop an index so in conclusion applying an index to a field allows for quick lookup of that field but it takes up more memory and it slows insert update and remove operations because you have to update the binary search tree use indexes wisely personally I would recommend an index if you're doing a lot of searching but not a lot of updating so that's an introduction to indexes in mongodb hey everybody with the last few minutes remaining of the mongodb in one hour series I thought I'd get a little more in depth with collections as we've learned at the beginning of the series a collection is a group of documents and a database is a group of collections within your database to show collections you can type show collections currently we only have one students let's create another though let's create a collection of teachers we'll use the DB dot create collection method pass in a name for this collection let's create a collection of teachers so this would work however there are some additional options that we can pass in as arguments to this method let's add the next argument it's comma separated another argument that we can pass into this method when creating a collection is a Max size for this collection we will set the kept field to be true that's informing mongodb this collection should have a maximum size this field is either true or false if capped is set to true you do need a minimum size specified so size that's a field then set a size in bytes if you would like a maximum size of 10 megabytes that would be 10 million 10 million bytes let me count my zeros yeah that's accurate and or you can have a maximum number of documents you will set the Max field to be some amount of documents I don't want any more than 100 teachers our collection has a maximum size of 10 megabytes we've also set that there can be no more than 100 documents in this collection we don't want any more than 100 teachers there are a few more advanced options for collections but that's beyond our level right now but another you may be interested in is auto index ID so that is a separate argument it's comma separated we need a document body Auto index ID this is either true or false based on indexes in the last topic automatically we apply an index to object ideas but we can toggle that to be true or false there are some pros and cons with indexes and index allows for quick lookup but any write operations are a little bit slower I'll set auto index ID to be false let's execute this command all right that was approved let's show our Collections show collections and we have two collections a collection for students and a collection for teachers hey let's create one more for practice let's create one more collection DB dot create collection what's the collection name let's create a collection of courses like what classes can we take at our school that was approved let's show our collections and we have three courses students teachers then to drop a collection you type DB the name of the collection let's drop our courses dot drop method that was dropped let's show our collections again and we are back to two collections a collection of students and a collection of teachers all right everybody that was mongodb in one hour hey if you've made it this far be sure you've smashed that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
5OdVJbNCSso,SQL Full Course for free 🐬,2023-01-02T15:00:02Z,hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to show you how we can start writing SQL using the MySQL workbench so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's get started everybody SQL it's an acronym meaning structured query language SQL is used to create retrieve update and delete data from a database suppose we own a business like the Krusty Krab from SpongeBob if we had to manually track all of the transactions by pen and paper well that would be a lot of extra work if we had a database we could keep track of these records electronically and save ourselves a lot of trouble right there's two types of databases I'll discuss relational and non-relational a table in a relational database it resembles an Excel spreadsheet there's rows and columns tables within a relational database can form well relationships with one another and that is done by this concept of keys which I'll explain in a further topic then there's non-relational databases that's where our data is organized in any format but a table this could include Json files key value pairs graph data structures entities of that nature to utilize data in a relational database we would use SQL then with a non-relational database we would use a different language named nosql meaning not only SQL but since this is an SQL series we will be working with SQL and relational databases not non-relational databases to write SQL statements we would need the help of a special piece of software known as a database management system people shorten this to Simply dbms it's a workspace for us to write SQL statements and generally just work with our database it'll make our lives easier there are different dbms systems you can use one of which is MySQL Microsoft SQL Server Oracle and postgres SQL but there's still many more out there each of these database Management Systems all use SQL but there's subtle nuances between these syntax of each database management system if you're familiar with one database management system transitioning to another will take little to no effort at all in this series we will be working with the mySQL database management system and I'll show you how to download that for both Windows and Mac OS hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain how we can download MySQL using the Windows operating system first of all head to this website mysql.com then go to the downloads tab scroll down look for MySQL Community downloads we'll click on that click on MySQL installer for Windows make sure that we have our Windows operating system selected then download the first installer no thanks just start my download we will open this download once it's complete there are various setup types depending on what packages you need for this series all we need is the server and the workbench we'll select the custom radio button click next we will need the most recent MySQL server add that to products to be installed open applications go to mySQL workbench we will add the most recent workbench we can close out of that there is a shell if you're interested in using that but I will be sticking with the workbench in this series once we have our server and our workbench I will click next then execute looks like there's an error downloading the workbench I'm going to try again and it worked this time for some reason let's click next execute give it some time once the installation status for the server and the workbench is complete we can click on next next I'll keep these default configurations next use strong password encryption for authentication let's click next here we're going to set the root password to access the server think of some password you would like I'm just going to set mine to be password I'll keep it simple yeah of course the password strength is weak you can add user accounts but that'll be outside the scope of this series click next you can start the MySQL server at system startup if you would like I'll keep that on click next then execute then finish then next yeah we might as well start the MySQL workbench after setup if this window doesn't pop up you can easily just search for it just look for MySQL workbench now we should have a local instance we can click on this to access our server let's pretend that this wasn't here I'm going to right click delete connection if you need to set up a connection hit this plus button we'll need a connection name I'll name this Local Host connection method should be standard TCP IP the host name is 127.0.0.1 at Port 3306 then press ok so now that we have our connection set up we can click on it type in the password you set for the server mine was simply password you could save the password if you want I might as well then okay and here we are within the MySQL workbench all right everybody in this topic I'm going to explain how we can download MySQL using the Mac operating system first head to this URL mysql.com we will go to the downloads tab scroll down look for MySQL Community downloads we'll need both the server and the workbench but let's start with the server click on this file Mac OS 12 DMG archive click the download button click on this link no thanks just start my download when this DMG archive is finished downloading we can double click on it just give it a second double click on the DMG archive allow click continue you can read the license agreement I'm going to pretend I did hit continue install type in your computer's password if this prompt comes up use strong password encryption hit next then we'll need a password for our server type in whatever password you would like to keep it simple for this lesson I'm just going to set my password to be well password by checking this box MySQL server will start once the installation is complete you might as well keep this checked but for demonstration purposes I'm going to show you how to start the server manually then close I'll go ahead and move the installer to the trash bin we have the server downloaded next we need to download the workbench again head to mysql.com go to downloads scroll down to mySQL Community downloads click on MySQL workbench then hit the blue download button no thanks just start my download then we can double click on this DMG archive when it's finished downloading so double click drag and drop the workbench icon into your applications folder before we access the workbench let's be sure that the MySQL server is running click on the top left Apple logo go to system preferences at the bottom left corner look for MySQL click on it then start MySQL server if it's not started already and you can check this checkbox so that your computer starts up with it running all right you may need to type in your password the server is now running to run the workbench we can go to finder then applications look for the MySQL workbench icon double click on it and here we are within the MySQL workbench to access the server you can click on this local instance connection then type in the password that you originally set for the server but if you're missing this connection you can hit the plus button then create a new connection name I'll name this Local Host use standard tcpip for the connection method hostname should be 127.0.0.1 and Port 3306 then press ok but I already have my connection set up click on your connection type in the password you set for the server then press OK and here we are within MySQL workbench hey everybody in this topic I'm going to show you how we can create alter and drop a database what is a database exactly think of it as a folder it acts as a container tables on the other hand would be the files found within the folder in this topic I'm going to show you how we can create the database itself but we won't be working with any tables until the next topic we'll need to begin by heading to our query window which is this large window right here we're going to write a statement to create a database we will type create there is no case sensitivity in MySQL these keywords such as create they can be all uppercase just the first letter could be capital or you could do all lowercase with the keywords I like to make them all uppercase but that's just me create database and then we'll need a unique database name what about my DB then it's important with all SQL statements to end each statement with a semicolon it's like the period at the end of a sentence that's how we know that the statement is complete so you'll need these three words create database then a database name we just named our database mydb hit this lightning bolt button to execute this statement and in my output window unfortunately I can't increase the font size but I can zoom in this action was successful we have created database mydb if you head to your schemas tab then hit the refresh button you should see a database in here named mydb there's also a database for sys sys is the internal database that MySQL uses we'll want to be sure that we're using the database that we just created to use a database we can either right click on the database then click on set as default schema or you could use a statement use then the name of the database my DB semicolon execute the statement we are now using my database to drop a database type drop database then the name of the database and our database is gone unfortunately we do need a database for this series so let's go ahead and recreate our database create database mydb refresh then just to be sure we're using this database we can either use that keyword use or you can right click on the database and set as default schema all right so we can create use and drop a database how about alter there's two features for beginners I'll mention setting a database to read only the other is enabling encryption let's set our database to be read only type alter database the name of the database read only equals one this statement would make our database read only if a database is in read-only mode we can't make any modifications to it but we can still access the data Within let's attempt to drop our database drop database my DB then we have a red X right here that means we could not complete this action drop database mydb schema my DB is in read-only mode to disable read-only mode you would set read only equal to zero now we would be able to drop this database alright everybody that is how to create use drop and alter a database think of a database as just a folder a folder can hold files the files will be the tables that we'll create which will store within the database and in the next topic I'll show you how we can create some tables hey welcome back everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can make some tables in MySQL a table in a relational database they consist of rows and columns kind of like an Excel spreadsheet in this topic we're going to create the table and the columns but we'll be populating the rows in the next video to create a table you'll type create table than the name of the table I'll create a table named employees then add a set of parentheses semicolon at the end within the set of parentheses we will list the columns for employees let's have an employee ID comma each column is separated with a comma then a first name last name how about hourly pay that'd be good higher date which date were they hired there's one thing that's missing after each column we need to set the data type of what we're storing within each column exactly is the data going to be whole integers decimals text a timestamp those are data types an employee ID that could be a whole integer the data type will be int add int after the column name a first name that's a series of characters the data type for some text would be VAR Char then within parentheses the maximum amount of characters I think 50 characters is enough for a first name last name varchar 50 is good hourly pay maybe our hourly pay is in dollars and cents we'll need a decimal portion there is a data type that is decimal add a set of parentheses we'll add the maximum amount of digits for our decimal I think 5 should be good then a Precision two for two decimal places the reason that I set the maximum digits of my hourly pay to be five is that I don't anticipate anybody's hourly pay being over 999.99 per hour that's pretty absurd I think five is enough then we have higher date there is a data type which is date if you need to work with dates otherwise there's date time if you need to include the time just the date is fine let's execute the script we have created our table employees if I were to refresh my schemas window underneath tables we have our employees table now I'll show you how we can select a table if you need to select your table you can type select asterisk from the name of the table employees let's take a look here's our table so far there's no rows but there are columns we have employee ID first name last name hourly pay and hire date if you need to rename a table you could type rename table the original name employees two whatever the new name is perhaps workers let's try that rename table employees to workers was successful if I refresh my schemas window the table employees is now known as workers but I think that's stupid let's go back and change it rename table workers to employees to drop a table I discussed this earlier you would type drop table the name of the table I don't want to drop this so I'm not going to execute the statement but that's how you would drop a table drop table the name of the table if you need to alter a table there is the alter keyword let's add a phone number alter table employees I'm going to write this next part of the statement on a new line what do we want to add uh what about a phone number add phone number then we'll need to list the data type of this column varchar is good Max size of 15 characters then we will end this statement execute the script all right we have altered our table let's take a look at our table select asterisk asterisk means all I don't know if I explained that select all from employees we have employee ID first name last name hourly pay higher date then our column phone number let's rename phone number and change it to something else we will again use the altar keyword alter table employees rename column phone number to let's say email okay then let's take a look again select all from employees yeah employee ID first name last name hourly pay higher date then email however the data type has not changed for email I'm going to refresh my schemas then underneath information underneath employees our email column has a max size of 15 characters let's change that alter table employees modify column email then the new data type varchar maybe a hundred characters for an email let's execute this statement refresh our schemas yeah now our email column has a size of 100 characters maybe we need to change the position of our email column if you need to move columns around this is how you can do so let's move our email column so it's after our last name column to do that we would type alter table the name of the table modify the name of the column to be moved email in this case then the data type this email column has a data type of varchar100 then after then the name of the column we would like our email column to follow I need my email column to come after my last name column I will type after last name then afterwards I might as well just display everything select all from employees you can write more than one SQL statement here we are employee ID first name last name email hourly pay higher date if you're modifying a column and need it to be first you could just say first email employee ID first name last name hourly pay higher date you can use the after keyword then a column or first if you need the column to be first now to drop a column you would type alter table employees drop column the name of the column to be dropped email our email column is no longer there all right everybody that's how we can create a table and work with the columns in the next video we're either going to talk about data types or learn about inserting rows into our tables I haven't decided yet but we'll probably cover one of those two hey everybody in this topic I'm going to show you how we can insert rows into a table we have a table named employees I will select everything from my table employees here are the columns we have an employee ID first name last name hourly pay and higher date to insert a row into a table we would type insert into the name of the table followed by values parentheses semicolon between this set of parentheses we will add all of the data for a row we will follow this order beginning with employee ID first name last name so on and so forth but we do have to pay attention to the data types too each piece of data will be separated with a comma let's begin with an employee ID the first employee will be Mr Krabs he's the first employee I'll give him an employee ID of one then we'll need a first name I'll put that within quotes because the data type of our first name is varchar basically speaking that's text Mr crab's first name is Eugene according to SpongeBob lore then we have a last name last name crabs hourly pay this is a decimal Mr Krabs hourly pay will be 25.50 I'm just making up numbers here higher date here's the format for a date with anesthetic quotes we will list the year followed by the month then the day I'll set Mr Krabs hired date to be January 2nd 2023 now we can execute these statements yeah here we go here's the first row employee ID one first name Eugene last name crabs hourly pay 2550 higher date January 2nd 2023 it can be somewhat tedious to manually insert each row one statement at a time let's insert multiple rows at once to do that after my set of parentheses I will add another set of parentheses each separated with a comma depending on how many rows I would like to enter so I have four employees I would like to enter I will add four sets of parentheses each separated with the combo and let me just do some formatting to make this look pretty each set of parentheses corresponds to a new row so let's enter all the data that we'll need for this table employee ID number two will be Squidward tentacles Squidward's hourly pay will be maybe a solid fifteen dollars Squidward's higher date the year 2023 January I think January 3rd is good all right so that is the next row let's work on employee number three employee number three will be a SpongeBob last name will be Square Pants SpongeBob's hourly pay will be 12.50 SpongeBob's higher date is the year 2023 January 4th employee for will be Patrick star Patrick's hourly pay will be 12.50 as well higher day 2023 January 5th okay last employee employee ID number five first name Sandy last name cheeks Sandy's hourly pay will be 17.25 she'll be an assistant manager Sandy's start date will be the year 2023 January 6th we can execute this statement to insert multiple rows all at once yep here's our table we have five rows each corresponding to a different employee we have Mr Krabs Squidward SpongeBob Patrick and Sandy I'm going to demonstrate what happens when we attempt to insert a row with missing data I will insert employee number six their first name is Sheldon last name Plankton but we will not insert an hourly rate of pay or a higher date here's what will happen so we have an error column count doesn't match the value at count at Row one we're missing data for our hourly pay and higher date you could insert just select columns that is done by adding after the name of the table add a set of parentheses then name the columns you would like to insert data into all we're adding is an employee ID first name then last name okay now we've inserted a new employee but there is data missing and that's okay we plan on hiring Mr Plankton but we have not yet negotiated an hourly pay or start date we still need to run a background check on him but we want to add him to the system at least so if you ever need to insert data into a row but you need to Omit certain columns you can simply just list the name of the columns you would like to sort data into all right everybody that is how to insert rows into a table in MySQL hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can select data from a table to query all of the data from the table we would type select asterisk meaning all from the name of the table in my case we have table employees this statement select all from employees will give me all columns and all rows but sometimes you may not want all of the data here's a scenario your boss gives you a task of retrieving the full name of every employee well we don't need employee ID hourly pay or higher date for that right we just need a list of the first and last names of our employees table in place of the asterisk meaning all we can select specific columns such as first name and last name we have all of the first and last names from our employees table you can change up the order of the columns too this time I would like last name then first name with our query this returned all of the last and first names of all the employees point being you can select specific columns depending on what you're looking for or everything with the asterisk there is a clause known as the where Clause if we're looking for something specific let's add where then what are we looking for exactly we can write some criteria let's select all from employees where employee ID equals one then end your statement with a semicolon this will give us a specific employee the employee that has an ID of one if I set employee ID to B2 that would give us Squidward three would be SpongeBob 4. Patrick I think you get the idea here's an exercise let's find all the data from employees where the first name equals SpongeBob where first name equals Sponge Bob this query will return employee ID3 the first name last name hourly pay and higher date here's another example let's find all employees that have an hourly pay greater than or equal to 15. our criteria will be where hourly pay is greater than we'll use the greater than operator or equal to 15. this returns three employees Mr Krabs Squidward and Sandy all three of them have an hourly pay of 15 per hour or greater it is possible your query can return multiple results let's find anybody that has a higher date less than or equal to perhaps the year 2023 January 3rd this query returns two results Eugene Krabs and Squidward Tentacles they both match this criteria and in this case we use the less than or equals to operator another operator you should know about is the not comparison operator it's an exclamation point and an equal sign we will check if something is not equal let's find where employee ID does not equal one who are all the employees that have an ID not equal to one that gives a Squidward SpongeBob Patrick Sandy and Plankton on the other hand if I set this to one that would give us Mr Krabs that is the not comparison operator if you need to check if something is not equal in this next example let's pretend that we're human resources we need to find any employees that do not have a higher date and then begin the paperwork for them currently Plankton's hourly pay and higher date are both set to null null meaning no value in place of saying you know higher date equals null in place of using the equal sign we would type is select all from employees where higher date is null that would return Sheldon Plankton because his higher date is null not equals null that doesn't work it would be is null you could even say is not null that would return every employee that does have a higher date all right everybody so that is how to query data from a table select whatever you're looking for it can be everything or specific columns from a table of your choosing where the results equal some criteria that you set it really depends on what you're looking for and that is how to query data from a table hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can update and delete data from a table in my example we have a table of employees however Sheldon Plankton is missing some information and hourly pay and a higher date let's update those fields to update some data in a table we would use the update keyword the name of the table employees in my example then set which column would we like to interact with first let's interact with hourly pay set hourly pay let's pay Plankton 10 and 25 cents per hour we should probably add a where Clause I need to specifically select Plankton where let's select his employee ID where employee ID equals six then semicolon 10 the statement you could also select Plankton by his first name or last name as well when I execute the script Plankton's hourly pay is now 10.25 cents per hour to update multiple columns you can change more than one field at once after your first change you can add a comma then change another field let's change Plankton's higher date to be the following higher date equals 10 23-0 Dash zero seven I'll make his hourly pay 10.50 I'm feeling generous here we are Plankton's hourly pay is now ten dollars fifty cents his higher date is January 7th 2023. to set a field to null meaning no value you would just say equals null for example let's take Plankton's higher date set the higher date equal to null Plankton's higher date is now null so maybe we're gonna fire him or something in this next example I'll give you a demonstration but you don't want to follow along to update all of the rows within a column you would exclude the where clause if I were to set hourly pay equal to 10.25 that would affect all of the rows after executing this statement the hourly pay for everybody is now 10.25. that's an example of how you could set a column to be one consistent value to delete a row from a table you would type delete from the name of the table now don't write just the statement it will delete all rows in your table here's an example do not do this I will delete from employees there my whole table is gone do not do this be sure to add a where Clause when deleting from a table otherwise this will delete all your rows where employee ID equals six yep and Plankton is no longer there all right everybody that is a super quick video on how to update and delete data from a table hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain Auto commit commit and rollback Auto commit is a mode by default Auto commit is set to on whenever you execute a transaction within MySQL that transaction is saved what if we were to make a transaction and we need to undo that transaction for example what if we accidentally delete all of the rows of this table don't do what I do but I'll give you a demonstration I accidentally type in delete from employees but I forget to add a where Clause well all my rows are now gone how do I undo these changes well what we're going to do is set auto commit to equal off with this setting set to off our transactions will not save automatically we would need to manually save each transaction it creates a save point so to say I'm going to create a save point by typing commit then execute now I'm going to select my table select all from the name of my table then I'm going to go ahead and delete all the rows delete from employees oh shoot but I forgot to add a where Clause my whole table is gone now luckily we created a safe point with that commit statement to undo these changes I can execute the roll back statement this will restore my current transaction back to the previous save point where we used commit now if I were to select all from the name of my table our table is back to what it previously was and again to save any changes let's say I delete my whole table again delete from employees if I want to save this change I would commit then again I will select my table and that last change is now saved my whole table is gone so yeah that is auto commit commit and roll back by default Auto commit is set to be on any transactions after executing are saved if that mode is set to off you can commit any changes manually to undo any changes use that rollback statement so yeah that is auto commit commit and roll back in MySQL hey everybody in this topic I have a super quick video on getting the current date and time in MySQL let's create a temporary table at the end of this topic we'll delete it create table I'll name this table test we will have three columns the current date I'll name the column my date the data type is date my time the data type is time then we'll combine both my date time the data type is date time let's create this table it was created successfully then I will select all from our table test we have three columns a date a time and a date time which combines both so how do we get the current date maybe we need to create a timestamp of when some event happened maybe a higher date for our employees so I'm going to insert into the name of my table test some values for the current date there is a built-in function current underscore date then add a set of parentheses this function will return the current date for the current time there is a current time function add a set of parentheses to the end of that function for the date time you could just say now the net a set of parentheses after inserting this row let's select all from our table test here's the current date of me filming this video October 21st 2022 the time is seven in the morning the current date time is October 21st 2022 7 in the morning a date time would probably be good for some sort of transaction you need to record for the time being I'm going to set the current time to be null as well as the date time to be null now if you were to take your current date then add plus one this part of my statement would refer to tomorrow October 22nd if you were to take your current date minus one that would technically be yesterday October 20th you could do something similar with your time and date time you can add or subtract seconds but I think that's pretty self-explanatory we don't need this test table anymore so we can delete it drop table test and it's gone all right everybody so that was a super quick topic but I thought I needed to cover it that is how to get the current date time and date time in MySQL hey everybody I have a quick video on the unique constraint the unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are all different that's basically it we can add this constraint when we create a table or after let's create a new table create table let's create a table of products what products do we offer we'll list the columns let's add a product ID the data type will be int product name the data type will be varchar maybe 25 characters then a price the data type will be decimal our price will have a Max size of four digits and a Precision of two decimal places to add the unique constraint select a column after the data type add the keyword unique and that's all you have to do with this keyword unique we can't insert any product names that are the same they all have to be well unique let's create this table let's say that you forget the unique keyword then you create the table what you could do instead is type alter table the name of the table products which we just created add constraint unique the name of the column within parentheses product name if you forget to add a unique constraint to a column after you already create the table this is what you can write however when I run this I do have a warning I already have a unique constraint on that column but yeah that's how you would add a unique constraint to a column in a table you have already created let's select our table select all from products we have a product ID column product name and a price let's insert all of our values insert into the name of our table which is products values will insert maybe four rows we'll need a product ID name then a price for a product name we have a hamburger and the product ID I'm just making up a number is 100. the name is hamburger the price will be 3.99 fries will be our next item then we have prize the price will be 189. 102 will be soda the price is one dollar even 103 will be ice cream the price will be 149. Let's test the unique constraint that we have added to the product name column suppose that I forget that I have fries on the menu already and I will add another row 104 frize 189 actually let me change the price to maybe something different like 175. here's what happens when I attempt to add two values that are the same duplicate entry fries for Key Products dot product name MySQL is telling us that we have a duplicate under the product name column we have fries twice since we added the unique constraint all values in this column must be different if I were to remove the last column where we have that duplicate well then this would run just fine now let's select everything from products yeah there we go here are the products we have a hamburger fries soda and ice cream all on the menu so yeah that's the unique constraint you can add that constraint when you create a table or after whatever column has that unique constraint all the values need to be different so yeah that's the unique constraint in MySQL hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the not null constraint the notch null constraint can be added to a column when you create a table whenever we enter a new row the value within that column can't be null for example I have table products we have a hamburger fries soda ice cream if I were to recreate this table I would type something like this create table products I would list the columns we have product ID the data type is integer product name the data type is varchar I believe I set this to be 25 last time then price that is a decimal we gave this column a Max size of four digits and a Precision of two any column that I do not want to have null values I will simply just add not no this is a constraint now I've already created this table so I'm not going to execute the statement but that's how you would create a table that has the notch null constraint after the column name you just type not null to add the not null constraint to a table that already exists you would instead type alter table the name of the table modify the name of the column the data type of the column in this case decimal four comma two then not null it's a little bit different than the unique constraint in the last topic so let's execute the statement that seemed to work let's add a new item to the menu I will select everything from my products table select from products let's add a new item to the menu and we will test that not null constraint insert into products values we have 104 product ID 104 will be how about a cookie I'm not going to set a price I will say null for the price maybe I'm not decided on what the price is yet after executing the statement well we have an error column price cannot be null since we said that not null constraint on the product price we can't enter a null value we could set this to be zero that's acceptable but it can't be null so yeah everybody that's the not null constraint it's a useful constraint to verify input if there's any column that you don't want to have any null values just add that constraint and yeah that is the not null constraint in MySQL hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the check constraint the check constraint is used to limit what values can be placed in a column for example I live in the United States depending on which state you live in there is a minimum hourly wage that employers have to pay in this example let's set an hourly pay to our employees table every employee needs to be paid at least the minimum wage in that region and we can do that with the check constraint we have our table of employees if I were to recreate this table it would look like this I think that was pretty close to add a check to a column at the end of our table this is what we would write check then within parentheses what sort of condition do we want let's check to see if our hourly pay column is greater than or equal to maybe ten dollars per hour that will be the minimum wage in this region this would work if we were to create this table however it's typically a good idea to give your check a name just in case you need to drop it later you can easily identify it so precede check with constraint then a constraint name what about chk meaning check underscore hourly pay this check will be known as check hourly pay so we can identify it then we can drop it or make any changes to it if we need to I do already have an employees table so I'm not going to execute this statement but to add a check constraint to a table you would just add a row like this to the bottom if you instead need to add a check constraint to a table that already exists this would be the syntax alter table the name of the table add constraint then we need a unique name for this constraint check hourly pay that's fine then the check within parentheses hourly pay is greater than or equal to 10. ten dollars per hour okay let's run this yeah that appears to have worked I'm going to select all from employees let's take a look at our table then we will attempt to add a new employee insert into employees values we need an employee ID first name last name hourly pay then a higher date employee ID will be six first name Sheldon plankton for hourly pay let's attempt to pay Plankton maybe five dollars per hour then a higher date [Music] 2023-01-07 let's see if that check constraint kicks in we're paying Plankton under ten dollars per hour yeah it doesn't appear that we can do so check constraint check hourly pay is violated now let's pay Plankton ten dollars per hour yeah that worked just fine if you need to delete a check you would type alter table the name of the table drop check then the name that you gave that check in my case it was check hourly pay and that check has been dropped yeah everybody that is the check constraint it's used to limit what values can be placed in a column it's another useful method for checking input and that is the check constraint in MySQL hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the default constraint when inserting a new row if we do not specify a value for a column by default we can add some value that we set here's an example let's select all from our products table select all from products in an earlier example we have a table of products a few items on the menu for sale are hamburgers fries soda and ice cream let's add a few items on the menu that would be free this could include napkins straws forks and spoons something you would commonly see at a fast food restaurant if we're not using the default constraint we would have to enter in those prices manually so let's insert into our table products our values product ID 104 will be a straw the price will be zero dollars and zero cents let's do this all together we have 105. 106 107. product number 105 will be a napkin the napkin is zero dollar zero cents 106 is a plastic fork again zero dollars and zero cents 107 is a plastic spoon the price is zero dollars and zero cents then I will select all from my products table here's our new products table we have our four items that actually cost something then our free items which are included with whatever we buy in place of explicitly stating a price one way in which we can make our lives easier if we're adding a bunch of free items to the menu we could set a default constraint where if we don't explicitly set a price the price will default to be zero it will be free so I'm going to undo everything that we just did delete from products where product ID is greater than or equal to 104. and then we can execute that statement if we were recreating this table with the default constraint we would type create table the name of the table products in this case add our columns we have a product ID the data type is integer we have a product name the data type is VAR chart and I forgot what the size was looks like 25. than a price which is a decimal Max digit size of four Precision of two now let's use the default constraint after the column you would like to add that constraint to type default then some value I will set the default value to be zero dollars and zero cents or you could just say zero too that'd be fine you would just add this constraint when creating a new table however I do already have a products table so this technically wouldn't work because that table already exists now to alter a table to include that constraint you would instead type alter table the name of the table alter the name of the column price set default constraint then the value so zero and that appears to have worked let's select our products table select all from products then we will insert some new rows insert into products than our values so we had four rows 104. that was a straw 105 was a napkin 106. was a fork 107. is a spoon then finished the statement with a semicolon so since we set that default constraint we don't need to explicitly list the price but we are missing one thing though when I execute this statement the column count doesn't match so when we insert into products we will list what we're inserting explicitly the product ID and the product name after our table name within parentheses type product ID then product name now this should work yeah and here's our products table with our four inserts all of the prices were set to zero and we did not need to explicitly state that this time if you don't specify a value you'll use whatever the default is here's another example I think you'll like this one let's say we have a table of transactions after inserting a new transaction we will insert a timestamp of when that transaction took place and that time stamp will be the default create table transactions at the end of this topic we will delete this table so don't get too attached to it we will have three columns transaction ID which will be of the data type integer a transaction amount let's just say amount the data type will be decimal five digits Precision of two is good then a transaction date the data type will be date actually let's make this date time I'd like to include the time of when this transaction happened now for the default constraint after the date time let's add default then the Now function we don't need to explicitly add the date and time that will be done automatically which is kind of cool so I'm going to create this table let's select all from transactions if we're going to insert some values we'll need at least a transaction ID and amount the transaction date will be included automatically so let's insert into transactions some values let's do one at a time the first transaction of the day will have a transaction ID of one I suppose a customer came in and bought a hamburger and a soda for a total of 4.99 then we do need to list the transaction ID then the amount after our table name add transaction ID then amount so let's run this yeah cool so there's our transaction ID this was order number one the total amount was 4.99 and we do have a time stamp of when this transaction occurred so the second order of the day will be for a total of 2.89 and that happened at this time then the third order of the day will have a total price of eight dollars 37 cents yep there we are so we don't need this table anymore I'm going to drop table transactions we will recreate this table in the future but I'd rather start fresh all right everybody that is the default constraint when you create a table or alter a table you can set a default value of some value you specify then whenever you insert a row that value will be included automatically which is pretty useful but yeah that is the default constraint in MySQL hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the primary key constraint in MySQL the primary key constraint can be applied to a column where each value in that column must both be unique and not null it's typically used as a unique identifier for example I live in the United States each citizen within the United States has a unique social security number there is a strong possibility that two citizens in the United States share the same first name and last name John Smith for example if we're trying to find John Smith well which one are we referring to we could instead search for a citizen with a unique social security number then we know for sure we have the right person that's kind of the same concept with the primary key also a table can only have one primary key constraint here's an example let's create a temporary table of transactions create table transactions there will only be two columns a transaction ID the data type is int I will set the transaction ID to be the primary key there can be no duplicate transaction IDs with the same value and none of them can be null then we will also have an amount how much was each transaction for the data type will be decimal Max size of five digits Precision of two and that is good enough then I will select all from our table transactions here's our table now to add a primary key constraint to a table that already exists this is the syntax alter table the name of your table add constraint the name of the constraint primary key within parentheses the column we would like to apply the primary key to transaction ID in this example then semicolon however we have already applied the primary key constraint to our transaction ID column so this isn't going to work but that's how you would add a primary key constraint to a table that already exists Let's test that theory of that limit of one primary key per table I'll attempt to add a primary key to our amount column and it does not appear we can do so multiple a primary key to find so like I said you can only have one primary key per table and that is typically used as the identifier let's take a look at our transactions let's populate this table with a few rows we will insert into our table transactions some values all we need is a transaction ID and an amount for our transaction ID I'll just make up a number all transactions will start in the thousands this will be our first transaction so the amount a customer bought a hamburger and a soda the total was 4.99 so let's run this there is our first row for the second transaction the transaction ID will be 1001 the customer bought fries and a soda for 289. so that appears to have worked as well now the next customer buys fries and ice cream for 3.38 cents Let's test that theory of each transaction ID having to be unique I'll attempt to insert this row with the same transaction ID as the previous row then let's see what happens duplicate entry 1001 for key transactions.primary yeah it appears that we cannot have two rows with the same primary key they each need to be unique let's change the transaction ID to 1002. that appears to have worked now the next transaction will be a hamburger and soda for 4.49 I will attempt to set the transaction ID to be null which we can't do either column transaction ID cannot be null each value that's set as a primary key can't be null and it needs to be unique so this transaction will have a transaction ID of 1003 two rows can share similar data we have two customers that bought both a hamburger and a soda for the same price but each transaction is uniquely identified by the transaction ID which we set as the primary key let's say that somebody comes in to request a refund and they give us a transaction ID well we can easily look that up and refund them whatever the amount was select amount from transactions where transaction ID equals 1003. so we are going to refund to the customer 4.99 well all right then everybody that is the primary key constraint it's most commonly used as a unique identifier you usually want a primary key in every table you make each value within a column that is set as the primary key cannot be no and it needs to be unique there can only be one primary key per table typically it's used as a unique identifier for each row and yeah everybody that is the primary key constraint in MySQL hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to explain the auto increment attribute in MySQL the auto increment attribute can be applied to a column that is set as a key whenever we insert a new row our primary key can be populated automatically then each subsequent row is auto incremented I'm going to recreate this table transactions but first I need to drop it drop table transactions then we will recreate this table but apply that auto increment feature create table transactions there were two columns a transaction ID the data type was int and an amount the data type was decimal five digits Precision of two the auto increment feature can only be applied to a column that is set as a key our transaction ID will set to be the primary key to apply the auto increment feature add the keyword Auto increment Now by default the primary key is going to be set to 1. so after creating this table I will select all from transactions okay we have successfully created our table then I will insert some values insert into transactions R values so we don't need to explicitly insert a transaction ID that'll be done for us automatically but we still need an amount I will insert 4.99 for the first amount since we're not inserting all of the values into a row explicitly we would need to specify what column this value is for that is for the amount okay let us execute this and take a look yeah so the transaction ID was set to one even though we did not manually insert that value let's insert the next amount so we have 289 yep transaction ID 2 is 289 3 38 transaction ID3 4.99 transaction ID of four we could set our primary key to begin at a different value to do that we would type alter table the name of the table Auto increment let's begin at 1000 instead of one then I'm going to go ahead and drop all the rows we'll start fresh delete from transactions select all from transactions okay then let's insert those rows again and see what happens insert into transactions R values 4.99 was the first amount this value is for our amount column now this transaction ID it begins at one thousand then it should Auto increment the next value was 289 our next transaction ID is 1001 338 1002 then 4.99 1003 all right everybody that is the auto increment feature it's a keyword that can be applied to a column that is set as a key whenever we insert a new row our key will be incremented by one for each row that we insert but yeah that is auto increment in MySQL hey everybody so in this topic I'm going to explain what the foreign key constraint is a foreign key think of it as a primary key from one table that can be found within a different table using a foreign key we can establish a link between two tables there's two primary benefits to this in my transactions table if I were to take a look at the customer ID of who initiated this transaction I could refer to the customers table then find the first and last name of that customer we can do that when we reach the topic of joins but in this video we're going to focus more or less on just creating foreign Keys another benefit when you create a foreign key constraint that would create a link between two tables which prevents any actions that would destroy that link between them so here's an example I have three tables employees products and transactions I'm going to create a new table of customers I'm going to create this table and speed it up feel free to pause the video if you need to here's my table we have a customer ID which is the primary key a first name and a last name let's populate our customers table we have three customers Fred fish Larry Lobster bubble bass each has a unique customer ID we're going to create a link between our customers table and our transactions table via our customer ID I'm going to drop our table transactions drop table transactions we will recreate this table but apply that foreign key constraint so again I'll speed up the footage now what I'm going to do is create a third column to hold our customer ID and the data type isn't I would like to add a foreign key constraint to our customer ID column on the next line I will type foreign key list the column we're applying this foreign key constraint too within parentheses customer ID references our second table the customers table customers then the column of the primary key which was customer ID and that's all you need to do then I will select all from my table transactions here is our table we have a transaction ID this is the primary key the amount of the transaction then the customer ID of who initiated that transaction our customer ID column is the foreign key it points to the customers table based on what the customer ideas we can find the first and last name of that customer to find any active foreign keys go to your table in this case transactions underneath foreign keys this section will display any foreign keys that are applied to this table we currently have one transactions underscore ibfk underscore one if you need to drop a foreign key you would type alter table the name of the table that has the foreign key constraint that would be transactions drop foreign key then the name of this foreign key transactions underscore ibfk underscore one and that foreign key should be gone you could also give your foreign key a unique name alter table the name of the table add constraint then some unique name let's rename that constraint as FK underscore customer ID foreign key the name of the column customer ID references the name of the second table customers then the column that has the primary key customer ID so to apply a foreign key to a table that already exists this would be the syntax you don't necessarily need to name the constraint but if you would like to just add that line add constraint then some unique name let's add this foreign key constraint to a table that already exists it worked if I were to refresh my navigator window we now have a foreign key and it's the one that we gave a name to foreign key customer ID what we're going to do is drop the rows from our transactions table then reinsert them but we will add a value for each foreign key so let's get rid of this delete from transactions then select all from transactions here we are okay so let's insert some new rows I do want to set auto increment to be a thousand so I'm going to do that before we insert some rows alter table transactions Auto increment equals one thousand so let's take a look at transactions then we will insert some new rows insert into transactions R values we had four transactions we will need an amount and the customer ID of who initiated the transaction the first order is for 4.99 customer number three initiated this transaction the second order is 289 customer number two initiated that transaction 338 this is also customer three they returned back the same day 4.99 customer number one initiated that transaction we have our primary key from the transactions table as well as our foreign key each of these customer IDs references the customer ID column from the customers table we won't get to explore that until we reach the topic on joins so the other benefit of a foreign key constraint is that we now have a link between our transactions table and to the customers table MySQL will prevent any actions that would destroy that link between them unless we explicitly drop that foreign key constraint I'm going to delete some of our customers delete from customers where customer ID equals three we were right it doesn't appear that we can do so cannot delete or update a parent row a foreign key constraint fails so yeah that's the foreign key constraint it's a primary key from one table that's found also within a different table but when we're working with that different table we would refer to that key as a foreign key we'll have more practice with this when we reach the topic on joins but yeah that is the foreign key constraint in MySQL hey everybody welcome back again in today's video I'm going to be explaining joins in MySQL a join is a clause that is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them such as a foreign key here's an example I have two tables a table of transactions and a table of customers think of these two tables as a Venn diagram transactions will be the table on the left customers will be the table on the right whatever data they have in common is the middle part of our Venn diagram for my demonstration to make more sense I will need to add a few extra rows feel free to pause the video if you need to catch up I will insert into transactions a new row the amount is one dollar the customer ID is null so not all transactions can have a customer ID that foreign key here's a scenario suppose that somebody comes in pays for a soda with cash well we wouldn't have a customer ID right if a customer instead paid with a credit card we could track who that customer was there may be a customer ID who initiated that credit card charge I'm going to insert this row and here's our new transactions table not all rows have a customer ID then let's add one more customer insert into customers first name last name will be poppy Puff let's select all of our customers now not all transactions have a customer ID and if not all customers have ever initiated a transaction they could be registered as a customer but they have never actually bought anything yet using joins let's take a look at what data these two tables have in common we'll discuss inner joins left joins and right joins let's begin with an inner join to create an inner join between these two tables you would type select all from which table would you like to be on the left think of that Venn diagram our transactions table will be on the left from transactions inner join whatever table you would like to be on the right in this case customers on we're going to join these two tables together by the foreign key from transactions we'll take transactions.the name of the foreign key column which was customer ID equals the table on the right dot the name of the primary key column which was customer ID then we will execute the statement and here's our new table we have created an inner join from these two tables based solely on what they have in common if you remember we don't have that Row for that transaction for one dollar that doesn't have a customer ID as well as our customer poppy puff there's no role for her in this table what we're telling MySQL is to select all rows from these two tables that have matching customer ideas so that's why some data was excluded one thing you could do with a join this applies to left joins and right joins as well you don't necessarily need to display every single column from both tables you can select specific columns let's select our transaction ID the amount the first name then the last name this would make it a lot easier to find the first and last name of who initiated a transaction at a given time we know who bought which order so that is an inner join join together any matching rows based on some Link in this case we're joining these two tables together by their customer ID now with the left join we are going to display everything from the table on the left but let's select all with the left join we will display everything from the table on the left our transactions however if there is a matching customer ID pull in any relevant data from the table on the right even though there's no customer ID with this latest row we're still going to display it with a left join but there's no data to pull in from the right table because there's no registered customer ID with the right join we will display the entire table on the right if there's any matches we will pull in any matching rows from the left we are displaying all of our customers if any of these customers ever initiated a transaction we will include the data from those transactions we still have poppy puff in our table but she has no relevant transactions she never initiated one so yeah everybody those are joins a join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them such as a foreign key like customer ID and that is a quick introduction to joins in MySQL hello again everyone today I will be explaining functions in MySQL a function is a stored program that you can pass parameters into to return a value if you look on mysql's main website there is a huge comprehensive list of functions in this video I'll only be showing you a few of the more useful ones for beginners but just so you know there's a lot of functions out there that do all sorts of things what if I would like to count how many transactions took place on a certain date to do that we can use the count function select count parentheses within my set of parentheses I can place a column then calculate how many rows are within that column let's calculate amount we will count how many rows are within the column amount then we will need a table from our table transactions so you could add a where Clause 2 like where transaction date is on a certain date but I want to keep this video as simple as possible this function will return all of the rows within this column amount which is five we have five transactions within this table now this column header is kind of ugly the column name is count the amount column you could give a column an alias by adding as then some nickname let's say count it's not necessary but if you want to make the column header look pretty or rename it as something you could do that count five we could even rename this column as today is transactions that works too do whatever you want to do let's find you the maximum value of our column amount by using the max function within the set of parentheses pass in your amount column I will give this column an alias of maximum and that is the maximum amount the largest order was 4.99 there's also Min to find the minimum as minimum the smallest order was for one dollar you could do average which is AVG as average the average order is three dollars and 45 cents we can find the sum of a column by using the sum function as some the sum of all of our transactions was 17 and 25 cents for this next example we're going to concatenate the first and last name of our employees select all from employees we have two columns one for a first name the other for a last name we're going to combine these two columns together with the concat function then create a new column named full name here's how to do that select concat first name last name then I'll add an alias as ball name here's what we have so far so we are concatenating the first and last names of our employees uh however we should separate each name with the space within our concat function I'll add a space character surrounded with commas to separate each argument there that's much better so that is the concat function we can concatenate values together such as if you need a column for somebody's full name but yeah those are just a few functions there's still many more we haven't covered but these are a few of the beginner ones you may be interested in but yeah those are functions in MySQL why hello again everybody guess who it's me again today I will be explaining logical operators in MySQL I would think of them as keywords that are used to combine more than one condition for my examples to make more sense I will add one more column a job column so let's alter our table of employees alter table employees add column job the data type will be varchar25 I'll add this column after our hourly pay column then select all from my table employees here is our job column let's add some jobs to our employees let's update employees set job equal to Let's select Mr Krabs he will be a manager then be sure to add a where Clause employee ID equals one Mr Krabs is a manager Squidward will be a cashier employee ID equals two SpongeBob employee ID3 he will be a cook Patrick will also be a cook Sandy will be an assistant manager let's abbreviate the word assistant manager Plankton Plankton will be a janitor how is this related to logical operators you're wondering well using logical operators we can check more than one condition suppose that our boss wants us to find any Cooks that were hired before January 5th how can we write a query that can satisfy those two conditions here's how we will use the and logical operator select all from our table employees using a where Clause we will write two conditions find any employees where the higher date is less than the year 2023 January 5th so far this would give us three results Mr Krabs Squidward and SpongeBob from these three employees how do we find any Cooks well we can add the and logical operator and we can write some other condition job is equal to cook there we have SpongeBob he is a cook that was hired before January 5th so that's the and logical operator you will return any results that match these two criteria another logical operator is or you can check more than one condition as long as one of those conditions is true that row will be true let's find any cooks or cashiers where job is equal to cook that gives us both SpongeBob and Patrick they're both Cooks or job is equal to cashier that would also include Squidward he's not a cook but he is a cashier with the or logical operator only one condition needs to be true whereas with the andological operator both conditions must be true so that's the main difference between the and as well as or logical operators with the not logical operator not is a little different not basically reverses anything you say let's find any employees that are not a manager where not job equals manager we have all of our employees besides Mr Krabs we have cashiers Cooks assistant managers and janitors you can combine logical operators too let's find anybody that's not a manager and not an assistant manager let's add and not job equals assistant manager we have everybody besides a manager and besides an assistant manager Mr Krabs and Sandy are not within the results so that is the not logical operator it basically reverses whatever condition you write there's also between is used within a single column it's very similar to the andalogical operator except people prefer to use the between logical operator when working with the same column just because of its readability let's find any employees where the higher date is between January 4th and January 7th where higher date between two values 2023 0 1 0 4 and 2023 0 1-07 so we have SpongeBob Patrick Sandy Sheldon there's also the in logical operator we can find any values that are within a set let's find where job is in cook cashier or a janitor yep we have a cashier a cook a cook and a janitor there is more than one way to write a query where you need to match more than one condition really the best way depends on your data set basically speaking logical operators are used to check more than one condition but they're done so in different ways depending on the logical operator that you're using but yeah those are logical operators in MySQL hello again people today I'm going to be explaining Wild Card characters there are two the percent and the underscore each of these is used to substitute one or more characters in a string here's an example I have a table of employees what if I need to find any employees whose first name begins with an S well you would think you could write something like this where first name is equal to s now this technically doesn't work here what we're doing is telling MySQL to find any first names that are equal to the character s if I instead need to find any first names that begin with the character S I can type S then the percent wildcard operator the percent wildcard operator represents any number of random characters but there's one more change we need to make still replace the equals operator with the like operator like when used with an aware Clause searches any patterns we will return any first names that begin with the letter s so the results are Squidward SpongeBob Sandy Sheldon their first names all begin with the letter s we could do this with dates too let's find any higher dates in the year 2023 technically that would return everything in my example because all the higher dates are in 2023. we can even find if something ends with a character let's find any last names that end with the character r that would return Patrick star star with an r at the end you could add more than one character let's find any first names that start with SP then change last name to first name that would return one result SpongeBob SP on the other hand we have the underscore wildcard character the underscore wildcard character represents one random letter let's find any jobs that have one random character followed by oh okay that would return any Cooks the underscore kind of reminds me of that game Wheel of Fortune MySQL is going to attempt to fill in any blanks with a matching character if we had two underscores well there technically wouldn't be any matches MySQL would technically be looking for a five-letter word where the middle three characters are oh okay but there's no matches here's another example find any higher dates in January higher date is like the year is going to be random we have four digits one two three four a dash character zero one Dash then a day of the month so two underscores again that would return pretty much all of our employees they were all hired in January maybe we don't care about the year or the month but we care about the day of the month so let's replace the month with underscores zero two that would return Mr Krabs zero three that would be Squidward now you could combine these two different wild cards together too let's take a look at our jobs let's find any jobs where the second character is an a I know it's kind of a weird example but hopefully it'll make sense select all from employees where job is like now we're going to combine these two wild characters the second character has to be an a we could use the underscore for the first character a then any amount of random characters afterwards that would return a manager cashier or janitor so yeah those are wild card characters you can use these to substitute one or more characters in a string it's pretty helpful if you need to find if a string starts with some value or ends with some value and those are wild card characters and MySQL hey everyone I have a super quick video on the order by Clause the order by Clause sorts the results of a query in either ascending or descending order based on which column we list here's an example I have a list of employees how can I list all of these employees alphabetically currently they are listed by their employee ID well at the end of my statement I can add an order by Clause order buy then a column to order our Rose by let's order all of these employees by their last name Now by default they will be ordered in ascending order or alphabetical order if you're working with characters for descending order or reverse alphabetical order just add desc for descending now these employees are listed in Reverse alphabetical order or descending order for us sending order that would be ASC but that is the default so you don't explicitly need ASC let's order these employees by their first name first name these employees are listed alphabetically by their first name let's do reverse alphabetical order yeah there we are let's order these employees by their higher date higher date and ascending order you don't even technically need that keyword ascending it would still work just fine now descending I think we have the hang of it now let's select all from transactions there's one more thing I want to show you select all from transactions we have two transactions with the same amount let's order by amount when ordering a column if two values share the same amount we can add an additional column to compare by order by amount but if two amounts are the same order by maybe customer ID these two rows are now flipped so you can order by more than one column if two columns share the same amount then order by some other column then you can add ascending descending however you want to order your table so yeah that is the order by Clause you can order your rows by some column you specify in ascending or descending order but yeah that is the order by clause in MySQL hello it's me again today I will be explaining the limit Clause the limit Clause is used to limit the number of records that are quarried it's very useful if you're working with a lot of data one use is that you can display a large data set on different pages also known as pagination here's an example I have a few customers not very many I'm working with a small data set if I would ever need to limit the amount of customers that are displayed I can add a limit Clause then set how many I would like to display I would like the first customer limit one that would return Fred fish in my example if I need the first two that would be Fred then Larry three is Fred Larry bubble that's kind of a weird first name and then four would be poppy currently these records are organized by customer ID we could combine the limit Clause with the order by clause let's order by last name then limit one that would return bubble bass it's an alphabetical order or we could do last name descending limit one poppy puff has the name and least alphabetical order I guess basically speaking limit limits the number of records that are returned it's very useful in combination with the order by clause which we learned about in the previous topic now with the limit Clause you can add an offset limit one one the first number is the offset limit to one record after the first that should technically return Larry Lobster yep Larry so limit two would add an offset of two which returns bubble Bass limit three would return poppy puff using an offset would be very helpful when working with a large data set if you need to display your records on different pages suppose that our data set is maybe 100 customers I need to display 10 customers per page so the first 10 would be just limit 10. but you know my data set's really small so it's not going to be apparent if I need the next set of 10 customers I can add an offset of 10. although I don't have that many customers to begin with the next set of 10 customers would be an offset of 20 then displayed 10 you know then 30 40 so on and so forth so yeah that's the limit Clause you will limit the results that are queried type limit then some number you could add an offset so display some number of Records after an offset but yeah that is the limit clause in MySQL hey welcome back today I will be explaining the union operator the union operator combines the results of two or more select statements I have created two additional tables I'm only going to be using them temporarily I'll delete them once we're done with this example I have a table of income we have two columns an income name and an amount I've just made up some numbers they're probably not realistic I also have a table of expenses here's my table of expenses we have an expense name and some amount again I just made up some numbers suppose that our boss wants us to print a list of all of our different income versus expenses all in one window well we can easily do that with the Union operator after our first select statement delete the semicolon add Union we now have a window with the results of these two select statements we have income and expenses let's perform a similar operation with our employees and customers table I'm going to drop these tables though they were only temporary drop table income drop table expenses let's begin Mr Krabs our boss he wants us to create a list of everybody that enters the store all employees and all customers while we can join together those select statements with the Union operator but first let's take a look at each of these tables select all from employees we're going to have one problem our employees table has six columns whereas our customers table our customers table has three columns if you're combining two different select statements that have a different amount of columns a union isn't going to work we have a problem the used select statements have a different number of columns in order to join two select statements together they need the same number of columns my employees table has six columns my customers table has three well we could select distinct columns all I need is the first name and the last name of each of these tables first name last name and look at that that works we have now created a list of all of the different people that enter our store both employees and customers there is a different variation of the Union operator that is Union all that would include any duplicates if more than one value is found within each table just temporarily I'm going to insert Plankton into our customers table insert into customers some values customer ID 5 first name Sheldon last name plankton select all from customers Plankton is both in our customers table and our employees table now what would happen if I add a union to those two select statements with just Union by itself union doesn't allow duplicates Sheldon Plankton is only within our list once with Union all you would include duplicates now Sheldon Plankton is in this list twice so use whatever is more fitting for your situation I'm gonna go ahead and delete Plankton from this table of customers all right yeah so that's a union everybody a union combines the results of two or more select statements in order to do so those two or more select statements need the same number of columns but yeah that is the union operator in MySQL hey everybody today I'm going to be explaining self joins a self-join is really just any type of join where you join together another copy of a table to itself they're used to compare rows of the same table they really help with displaying a hierarchy of data so a self join you just join another copy of a table to itself so here's an example I have a table of customers I'm going to create another column named referred by if a customer refer somebody and they register as a new customer maybe they get like a free meal or something let's create a new column within our customers table alter table customers add referral ID the data type will be int then select all from customers now let's populate this column update customers set referral ID equal to one where customer ID equals to our first customer Fred fish he was not referred by anybody that value will be null however Larry Lobster was referred by Fred fish we'll set the referral ID for him to be won Larry Lobster was referred by Fred fish so Fred fish gets a free meal at the Krusty Krab now Larry Lobster he's going to refer both bubble bass and Poppy puff so he'll get two free meals set referral ID equal to 2 where customer ID equals three and four Fred fish referred to Larry Lobster Larry Lobster referred bubble bass and Poppy puff it makes me think of a pyramid scheme I'm going to use a self-joint to replace our referral ID column with the first and last name of the customer that referred one of these people so I'm going to select all Now when using a self join we'll take from our table customers than inner join customers basically we're just joining another copy of a table to itself but we'll need to give these tables what's known as an alias a nickname let's say from customers as maybe a that's the nickname inner join customers as b the original copy of our customers table will be referred to as a the copy will be B they are the exact same table but we have two of them and we'll stitch them together with a join to link these Tables by the referral ID and the customer ID I'll add this additional line on referral ID equals customer ID let's take a look to see what we have so far column referral ID in on Clause is ambiguous am I referring to the referral ID of table a or table B I'm referring to the referral ID of table a what I'll do is prefix this column name with the name of my table followed by dot a DOT referral ID equals I need the customer ID from my table copy which is known as B I will prefix B to this customer ID column the referral ID of table a is linked to the customer ID of table B oh yeah look at that we have joined these two tables the referral ID of table a is linked to the customer ID of table B I don't necessarily need all of these columns we're displaying everything let's select only specific columns I would like a customer ID first name last name now we have one problem with our first name and last name do we mean the first and last name Columns of table a or table B let's prefix these columns with the name of our table the Alias we're using I would like the first name from table a the last name from table a followed by I'm going to put this on a new line just for readability the first name of table B then the last name of table B then be sure to include that within the customer ID too so the customer ID of table a okay we're getting somewhere customer ID first name last name first name last name okay so if somebody were looking at this table they would think why are there two columns for both first name and last name let's concatenate these two columns concat first name last name I'll add a space in between the first name and last name I'm going to give this column an alias as referred by all right there's our table we have all of our customers who were referred by another customer Larry Lobster was referred by Fred fish bubble bass and Poppy puff were both referred by Larry Lobster you could use a different type of join besides an inner join we could use a left join what we're telling MySQL is to display all of our customers on the left table if one of these customers was referred by another customer join those rows as well you can see that with the left join that Fred fish is still within our table but he wasn't referred by anybody that value is null so that's one example of a self-join we're creating another copy of the same table then joining it together to the original but you'll need to give each table an alias a unique nickname here's another example of a self-join let's select all from our employees table in our employees table Mr Krabs is a manager Sandy Cheeks is an assistant manager let's add an additional column named supervisor ID to who does each of these employees report to Squidward SpongeBob and Patrick and Sheldon they will all report to Sandy who's an assistant manager Sandy will report to Mr Krabs he's the main manager and Mr Krabs doesn't report to anybody let's add another column alter table employees add supervisor ID the data type is int and there's our new column update employees set supervisor ID equal to five that would be Sandy she's the assistant manager where employee ID equals two that would be Squidward Squidward is now supervised by Sandy three that's for SpongeBob four is Patrick six is Sheldon Plankton now Sandy her supervisor idea is going to be one she is supervised by Mr Krabs set supervisor ID equal to one where employee ID equals five and here we are using a self join we are going to display the first and last names of all of our employees along with the full name of the person that's supervising them because currently we only have supervisor ID let's utilize a self-join first let's select all from our table employees we'll need to give this table an alias as a that's the original Let's do an inner join inner join employees as b b will be the copy how are we going to link these on the supervisor ID of table a equals the employee ID of table B all right we still have one massive table but we can see here that Sandy appears in multiple rows which is a good start we don't necessarily need all of this let's select the first name and last name of table a a DOT first name a DOT last name then I'm going to concatenate the first and last name of table B so concat B DOT first name I'll add a space between the first name and last name B dot last name I'm gonna give this column an alias that's really ugly as reports two that's much better all right we have our hierarchy of data Squidward SpongeBob Patrick and Sheldon Plankton they all report to Sandy Sandy she reports to Mr Krabs that Mr Krabs doesn't report to anybody if you would like all of your employees even if they don't report to anybody you could instead use a left join because I left join we will display all of the rows from our table on the left so Eugene Krabs is here but he doesn't report to anybody so yeah basically speaking that's a self join you can use any type of join but the tables you use are the same one you use the original table then a copy of that table but you'll need to give them an alias to distinguish them when we're selecting the first and last names of our tables are we referring to the original table which I named as a or the copy because that makes a difference with self-joints they're great if you ever need to display a hierarchy of data involving the same table but yeah that is a self-join in MySQL hey everybody today I'm going to be explaining views views their virtual tables they're not real they're made up of fields and columns from one or more real tables and they can be interacted with as if they were a real table so here's an example I'm going to select all from my employees table our boss Mr Krabs he would like us to create an employee attendance sheet made up of just the first and last names of all the employees well I could create a view that is made from the first and last name Columns of the employees table now A View isn't a real table but it can behave as if it were I may want to create a view of the employee first and last names instead of another table because we try not to repeat data if we don't have to if I had two tables one of employees and another of employee attendance if I need to remove an employee I would need to do so in two places with the view it's always up to date any changes to one or more of these real tables will also update the view so let's create a view of the first and last name of our employees table to create a view you would type create view then the name of the view let's say employee attendance then as I'm going to zoom in a little bit what would we like to select let's select first name last name from a real table let's say from employees so everything was successful let's refresh our schemas window underneath the views category we have a new view employee attendance I'm going to select all from that view name employee attendance and let's see what we got yeah here's our attendance sheet we have the first and last name columns from the employees table this view can be interacted with as if it were a real table I will add order by last name ascending you can use keywords and operators that we've learned about in previous lessons on A View to drop a view you would type drop view the name of The View employee uh tendons and it's gone all right here's another example so views they're always up to date right let's create a view of customer emails select all from customers let's take a look to see what we have so far I'm going to add one more column a column of customer emails alter table customers add column email data type will be varchar I think varchar 50 should be enough space and there's our new column let's update these rows update customers set email equal to the first email will be for Fred fish f isch gmail.com then we'll need a where Clause where customer ID equals one that's our first email customer ID 2 will be L Lobster gmail.com three is B bass gmail.com four will be puff gmail.com everybody really likes Gmail I guess let's create a view from these customer emails create View customer emails as what are we selecting let's select the email column from our customers table let's refresh our schemas window yeah we have a customer emails View then I will select all from customer emails and look at that we have a listing of all the customer emails and we're going to spam these people with coupons or something I don't know when you update one or more of the real tables in your database those views would reflect any changes let's add one more customer so let's take a look at our customers table select all from customers let's add one more customer insert into our customers table some values we have five columns a customer ID first name first name will be pearl last name is crabs referral ID let's say null email will be P crabs gmail.com okay there's our new customer let's take a look at our view let's see if it updated select all from customer emails yeah look at that it's up to date that is one of the benefits of a view it will update automatically because we're using components from real tables any views that use that data will also be updated the other benefit of a view is that we don't have to repeat data in a real table ideally we'd only want to make a change in one place rather than across multiple tables alright that's a view everybody a view is a virtual table based on the results of an SQL statement they're not real tables but they can be interacted with as if they were real the fields found within a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database so yeah those are views in MySQL yeah it's me again and in today's video I need to explain what indexes are in MySQL and index is a type of data structure they are used to find values within a specific column more quickly it's technically a b tree data structure if you're familiar with what that is but if you don't don't worry about it MySQL normally performs searches sequentially through a column if I'm looking for some specific value just scan each value on the way down to see if those values match depending on what I'm looking for it doesn't really take much time if you have a small data set like I do but imagine if you have millions of transactions searching each transaction one by one is going to take a long time we can speed up that process by using an index by applying an index to a column selecting or searching takes less time however updating takes a lot more time so there are some pros and cons with using an index it really depends on the table if I'm working with a table of transactions transaction actions are being updated all the time people are constantly making purchases I don't think our transactions table would be a good candidate for an index we'll be doing a lot of updating but not a lot of searching however with our customers table I think our customers table could benefit we don't update our customers table very often only a new customer comes in every once in a while let's reduce the time it takes to search for a customer with creating an index how exactly do we want to find the customer believe it or not we do have an index with our customer ID already a customer may give you their last name and or first name let's create an index for these we'll start with last name though to show the current indexes of a table you would type show indexes from the name of the table here are the current indexes for our customers table we do have one already and that's for our customer ID that is the primary key we can search for a customer by their customer ID fairly quickly but not so much by their last name or their first name let's apply an index to those columns to create an index you would type create index then a name I will apply an index to our last name column I will name this index last name idx meaning index on the table customers in this case then list a column I will apply an index to our last name we will be doing a lot of searching by a customer's last name so I might as well apply an index so let's execute the statement let's show our indexes again show indexes from customers and here is our new index last name index it's applied to our column last name if I were to search for a customer by last name that process will be sped up now select all from customers where last name is equal to puff so my data set is already very small to begin with there's not going to be a noticeable difference in this example but if I'm working with a million customers using an index would be a lot faster if I were to search by first name instead where first name equals Poppy uh I spelled copy wrong well we don't have an index applied to our first name as of now it would be slower to search for a customer by their first name compared to their last name that first name doesn't have an index realistically we wouldn't search for a customer just by their first name we would do a last name or a last name and a first name that's where multi-column indexes come in to create a multi-column index you would type create index a unique name let's say last name first name idx on our table customers then list the columns in order the order is very important MySQL has what's known as a leftmost prefix with indexes so we will search by last name then first name let's execute the statement show our indexes show indexes from customers here's our last name first name index there's a sequence we're telling MySQL to search by a last name however if there's also a first name include that too there needs to be a last name to utilize this index if I want to I can get rid of this last name index because our last name first name index would do the same thing we can search for a last name as well as a first name if we would like to drop an index you would type alter table the name of the table drop index the name of the index last name index then I'm going to go ahead and show indexes from customers and the last name index is gone now if I was to search for a customer select all from customers where if I were to search for a last name we would benefit by using this multi-column index if I looked for a last name and a first name we would also benefit there's a sequence we would search through any last names first because that's first in the sequence but if I was to search for just a first name we would not utilize this index well everybody that's an index it's a type of data structure that is used to find values more quickly within a specific column MySQL normally searches through a column sequentially the longer the column the more expensive the operation is going to be if you were to apply an index to a column searching and selecting a value takes less time but updating that table takes longer use it if you think a table is a good candidate where you don't update it very often and well yeah those are indexes in MySQL well hello again everybody today I need to explain subqueries they can be pretty complicated but I'll try my best to explain it simply a sub query is just a query within another query you write a query and close it within a set of parentheses whatever value or values are returned from the subquery you would use within an outer query I'll give you a few demonstrations I have an employees table our manager Mr Krabs he needs us to compare every employee's hourly pay with the average hourly pay of our employees table maybe Mr Krabs is going to give people a pay reduction not an increase a pay reduction but he needs to compare the hourly pay of every employee versus the average how can we write something like that a task like that I would say involves at least two steps we need to find the average hourly pay first and then display every employee's first name last name hourly pay then the average pay let's begin with the average pay select average function hourly pay from my employees table so far so good 15.45 is the average hourly pay of an employee how do I use this number whatever value or values are returned from a sub query we can use within a larger outer query let's delete this semicolon I will surround this statement with a set of parentheses I will then write the outer query let's select the first name last name the hourly pay then comma our subquery from employees there we are although I'm going to give the subquery an alias as average pay and I think I'm going to move this to the next line that is much better so we have accomplished our task we have compared every employee's hourly pay versus the average once we complete the subquery whatever value or values are returned from the sub query we would use within the larger picture the outer query just imagine that we replaced the subquery with 15.45 this value is what was returned although you don't want to write a concrete number like this just because the average pay is bound to change writing a sub query like this would calculate our average pay regardless if we add or remove employees let's try a different example let's find every employee that has an hourly pay greater than the average pay so again we can begin with the sub query we need the average pay select average function hourly pay from employees so again we return 15.45 I'll use this within a where Clause let's select the first name last name hourly pay from our employees table where the hourly pay is greater than our sub query Mr Krabs and Sandy Cheeks are both making more than the average hourly pay what was returned was 15.45 then it's just a matter of completing the outer query select the first name last name hourly pay from employees where hourly pay is greater than 15.45. it looks complicated but when you break it down into steps it's a lot easier to visualize we're going to cover a completely different example we will be working with customers and transactions I'm going to select all from my transactions table we have a few transactions I would like to find the first name and last name of every customer that has ever placed an order we can do this step by step let's select every customer ID from transactions that's not null select customer ID from transactions where customer ID is not no let's take a look so we do have a few repeats we have one two three and three you can add this distinct keyword if there's any repeats that would eliminate them we have three registered customers that have placed orders in the past customer ID is one two and three but we don't know who these customers are we will use these values within a larger outer query I will surround this query within a set of parentheses eventually we'll use this within a where clause let's select the first name and last name from our customers table where customer ID I will then use the in operator then add my sub query there we are there's our three customers that have placed orders in the past Fred fish Larry Lobster bubble bass this sub query return to the values one two and three imagine that once this query resolves we are left with the values one two three so this outer query makes a lot more sense select the first name and last name from customers where the customer ID is one of these values one two or three you could do the inverse two find the first name and last name of every customer where the customer ID is not in the sub query this query would return every customer that has never placed an order let's send them a coupon in the mail to convince them to place an order we were left with values one two three select the first name and last name from any customers where the customer ID is not in one of these values one two or three Pearl Krabs had an idea five poppy pups was four so yeah that's a sub query everybody it's just a query within a larger query it helps to visualize this step by step imagine that we're completing the subquery first whatever value or values are returned we can use within a larger query and well yeah those are subqueries in MySQL hello everybody today I will be explaining the group by Clause the group I Clause will aggregate all rows by a specific column it's often used with aggregate functions such as the sum function Max Min average count just to name a few for my example I have a table of transactions now if you've been following along in my video series I did add an additional column named order date and filled in a few dates as well as two additional rows if you would like to follow along I would recommend pausing the video adding a new column for order date add these order dates then add to additional rows that's all the data that we'll need in this topic now our boss Mr Krabs he needs us to tell him how much money he made per day what is the sum of all of the amounts per day we have three different dates January 1st January 2nd January 3rd what is the sum of every amount on these days so we can use the group I Clause that would help us we will select the sum of every amount as a column we will also display the order date from transactions then we will Group by we are grouping by our order date Group by order date column yeah look at that there we are here is the sum of every amount that is grouped by these dates here's the total amount we made January 1st the total amount January 2nd the total amount January 3rd let's try a different function how about V Max function what was the maximum amount on each day these are the maximum transactions that have occurred on these dates what about men these are the minimum amounts grouped by order date what's the average order every day you're the averages maybe count how many transactions have taken place each day we have two orders on the first two orders on the second three orders on the third let's try a different column let's Group by customer ID this time how much has each customer spent total we will select the sum of every amount we will also need a column for customer ID from our table transactions then we will Group by the customer ID column this time here is the sum of every amount that each customer has ever spent we do have some rows that don't have a customer ID so we would sum those amounts as well so far the customer with an ID of three they have spent the most amount of money at our establishment what about the max here is the maximum order that each customer has placed the min the average then count here is the amount of times that each customer has ever visited our establishment what if we would like to use a where Clause well using a where Clause along with the group I Clause normally doesn't work for example I would like to display all customers that have visited more than once who are the repeat customers so if I attempt to use a where Clause where count our amount column is greater than one well we would run into an error if you need to use a where clause and you're using the group by Clause you would want to instead use the word having that would do the same thing Group by customer ID where the customer ID has made more than one purchase we are also aggregating all of the customer ideas that are null let's use the and logical operator to remove that and customer ID is not null there we are the customer that has an ID of three they have visited our establishment two times they meet the requirements of this having Clause they have visited our establishment more than once and their customer ID is not null so if you ever need to use a where Clause if you're already using the group I Clause you would instead use having so in conclusion the group by Clause will aggregate all rows by a specific column it's often used with aggregate functions such as sum Max Min average count for example you could Group by an order date what are the total sales per date or by a customer ID how many times has each customer visited our establishment those are just a few examples and well yeah that is the group by clause in MySQL hey again it's me today I'm going to be explaining the roll-up Clause like a fruit roll-up it's an extension of the group by Clause it produces another row and shows the grand total it's also known as a super aggregate value here's an example I have a table of transactions what I would like to do is to group each transaction by the order date then produce a grand total here's what we'll do I'll give you a few different examples let's begin by selecting the sum of the amounts and the order date from our table transactions then we will Group by the order date and there we are we have the sum of every amount per order date using this roll-up Clause I can add an additional row that shows a grand total so to say all I have to do after the group by Clause is ADD with roll up and there you go here's the grand total 7.88 plus 8.37 plus 8.97 is 25.22 here's another example let's count the transaction ideas buy order date we have two transactions on the first two on the second three on the third for a total of seven transactions I'll give you two more examples let's select the count of our transaction ideas per customer I'm going to give this count an alias as number of orders as well as the customer ID column from our table transactions we will Group by customer ID let's see what we have so far then I will add with roll up here are the amount of orders per customer ID the customer with an ID of three has visited here more than once the grand total of the number of orders is seven that's the roll up one last example let's select our employees table select all from employees we will group all of these employees by their employee ID then display a roll-up of all of the hourly pay as a business how much are we spending on all of our employees per hour so let's select the sum of our hourly pay I'll give this an alias as hourly pay I guess it really isn't different from the column name we will display the employee ID as a column from our table employees Group by the employee ID with rollup here's the hourly pay of each employee as well as a grand total if all of our employees are working currently we are spending as a business 92.75 cents per hour well yeah that's the roll-up Clause everybody it's an extension of the group by Clause it produces another row and shows essentially the grand total it's also known as a super aggregate value to include a roll-up after the group by Clause just add with roll up it's probably good for accounting and well yeah that's the roll-up clause in MySQL why hello there everybody today I will be explaining the on delete Clause there's two versions on delete Sentinel and on delete Cascade with on delete set null when a foreign key is deleted we can replace the foreign key with the value no otherwise there's and delete Cascade when a foreign key is deleted delete the entire row here's an example let's take a look at our table transactions select all from transactions in my transactions table the customer ID column is the foreign key what would happen if I were to delete one of these customers let's select all from our customers table I'm going to delete poppy puff she has a customer ID of four delete from customers where customer ID equals four if you run into this error cannot delete or update a parent row a foreign key constraint fails there's a foreign key that's preventing us from deleting this customer because this customer is used elsewhere in a different table like that transaction stable so just temporarily for this demonstration I'm going to set foreign key checks to be zero and that should work our customer with an idea 4 is gone one two three five poppy puff is no longer within our customers table before I forget I'm going to set foreign key checks back to one let's take a look at our transactions table underneath this transaction of 1005 we're referencing a customer that doesn't exist the customer with an idea 4 is no longer within our customers table we have a couple options whenever we delete a primary key from another table that's being used as a foreign key as somewhere else we can either replace that value with null or delete the entire row with Cascade with on delete set null we can replace this value with null much like these two rows or on delete Cascade we can delete the entire row let's begin with on delete Sentinel I'm going to reinsert Poppy puff back into our table of customers and there we are poppy puff is back in the customers table now with on delete Sentinel if we're creating a new table let's say I'm recreating my table of transactions after adding the foreign key constraint foreign key our customer ID column references the customer ID column of the customers table I can add this clause on delete set no that's if I'm creating a new table but I already do have a transactions table I don't want to update it however we can update an existing table with this Clause I already do have a foreign key constraint I'm just going to drop it real quick alter table transactions drop foreign key then the name of the foreign key mine is FK underscore customer ID and that key is now dropped we are going to add a foreign key constraint to our transactions table with this clause on delete Sentinel alter table the name of the table add constraint you can give your constraint a name I'll give it the same name as before FK customer ID list the foreign key foreign key my foreign key is customer ID references another table which was customers and what is the primary key of that table customer ID then we will add the clause on delete set no if I delete a customer ID from customers the foreign key of that row will be set to null automatically let's execute this let's take a look at our transactions table select all from transactions I am now going to delete customer number four from the customers table delete from customers where customer ID equals four yeah check that out with our transaction ID of 1005 the customer ID is now null now there's and delete Cascade when a foreign key is deleted we can instead delete the entire row let's go ahead and add poppy puff back to our customers table all right she's back in let's drop the current foreign key constraint of our transactions table alter table transactions drop foreign key FK customer ID or whatever else it's named and that key is now gone we will add the on delete Cascade Clause to a table that already exists alter table transactions add constraint you can come up with the name FK underscore transactions underscore ID list the foreign key foreign key customer ID references the customers table and the primary key of that table is the customer ID then add on delete Cascade let's take a look at our transactions table select all from transactions oh let's update this customer ID real quick I forgot to do that update transactions set customer ID equal to four where transaction ID equals 1005. yeah I forgot to add that back now let's do it delete from customers where customer ID equals four yeah take a look at that the entire row is now gone we have transactions one thousand three one thousand four one thousand six one thousand five is missing because it was referencing the customer with an ID of four we set the foreign key to delete the entire row when that foreign key is deleted that is on delete Cascade well in conclusion everybody on delete is a clause where if you delete a foreign key you can set that value to be null or Cascade which will delete the entire row which has its uses and well yeah that's the on delete clause in MySQL why hello again it's me so today I gotta explain stored procedures a stored procedure is prepared SQL code that you can save it's great if there's a query that you write often for example I have this statement it's very verbose there's a lot we have to write if this statement is something I have to write often I could save it and reuse it later this statement will interjoin the transactions table and my customers table then display all customers that made a transaction this statement is very verbose if I have to write the statement often I could save it as a stored procedure I can refer to the nickname that I gave that snippet of code the name I gave this procedure was get customers then I need to call this stored procedure and that does the same thing and it's a lot less to write there's also a few other benefits which we'll discuss at the end of the video let's begin with something simple I would like to select all from my customers table to turn the statement or statements into a stored procedure I will type create procedure then a name for the statement or statements I will name this statement get customers add a set of parentheses type the keyword begin wherever your statement or statements end type end then for clarity I'm going to tab all of my statements between begin and end so we have a problem we're trying to create this procedure however MySQL is stopping at this semicolon here we end all statements with a semicolon rather than at the end our semicolon is known as a delimiter it's kind of like the period at the end of a sentence we're telling MySQL that our statement ends here but we need our statement to end here after the end keyword we can actually change the delimiter temporarily type delimiter before we create the procedure typically when people change their delimiter temporarily they'll either use two forward slashes or two dollar signs I'll stick with the dollar signs because I think that's cooler after we create our procedure let's change our delimiter back to the semicolon MySQL no longer recognizes our semicolon as the delimiter after the end keyword I will use our new delimiter to end this statement that should work now let's execute the statement we have created our procedure I'm going to refresh my navigator window underneath stored procedures we have our stored procedure of get customers to invoke the stored procedure type call the name of the procedure get customers add a set of parentheses then a semicolon that will execute whatever code you stored within your stored procedure to drop a stored procedure you would type drop procedure the name of the procedure get customers let's try another example this time we will send our procedure a piece of data within the set of parentheses a customer ID number such as 1 2 3 4 so on and so forth we will get a customer by their customer ID we will create a procedure I will name this procedure find customer add a set of parentheses to find a customer by their customer ID when we invoke the stored procedure within the set of parentheses we will need to place a customer ID but when we create the stored procedure we have to set up what is called a parameter we will type in then a nickname for that piece of data we're passing in a transaction ID I'll give this parameter a nickname of ID then we need the data type of what we're passing in we're passing in an integer so we have one parameter set up let's use that begin keyword that end keyword list our statement or statements between these two keywords I will select all from my customers table where my customer ID equals the ID that we pass in that nickname we need to change the delimiter because MySQL thinks we're trying to end our statement here but we need it to end after the end keyword so let's change the delimiter to double dollar signs then change it back [Music] all right we have created that stored procedure let's invoke it call find customer within the set of parentheses we need to pass in a customer ID number let's pass in one that would give us Fred fish two is Larry Lobster three is bubble Bass five is Pearl crabs when you invoke a stored procedure you can pass in some data depending on what you need exactly for your stored procedure let's drop this procedure then do one last example drop procedure find customer [Music] this time we will send two arguments two pieces of data a first name and a last name create procedure find customer within our set of parentheses the first piece of data we'll pass in will be a first name but first is already a keyword maybe F name meaning first name then the data type let's see for customers the data type of first and last names is varchar50 varchar 50. for your next piece of data you would separate that with a comma in our nickname will be lname for last name data type is varchar 50. then I'm just going to put that on a new line for clarity type the begin keyword and write your statements between begin and end we will select all from our customers table where first name equals the name of the data that we pass in and last name equals the other piece of data the second piece the last name again we need to change the delimiter to create this procedure double dollar signs then change it back we have created our stored procedure let's invoke it call find customer within the set of parentheses we will list a first name and a last name Larry comma Lobster get Larry Lobster's information let's find him and there he is customer id2 first name Larry last name Lobster referral ID of one email is L Lobster gmail.com all right everybody that is a sword procedure it's prepared SQL code that you can save it's great if there's a query that you write often a few of the benefits is that it reduces Network traffic it increases performance and is more secure and administrator can grant permission to a user or an application to use a stored procedure one of the downsides though is that it increases memory usage of every connection and well everybody those are stored procedures in MySQL hey everybody today I need to explain triggers when an event happens a trigger does something I know that sounds very generic for example when we insert update or delete a record we can use a trigger to check data handle errors or audit tables we could do a plethora of things here's an example I have a table of employees we have an hourly pay column maybe I would like a salary column whenever we add an employee or update our hourly pay the employee's salary will be changed automatically with the trigger before creating a trigger let's update our employees table We'll add a salary column alter table employees add column salary the data type will be decimal 10 digits Precision of two we will place this column after the hourly pay column then select all from our employees table let's see what we have there we are there's our salary column let's update our employees table set our salary column equal to the hourly pay times to calculate an employee's salary using an hourly pay Sheldon Plankton for example take the hourly pay ten dollars per hour there's typically 40 hours in a work week then 52 weeks in a year Plankton would have a salary of twenty thousand eight hundred dollars so a shortcut you could just take the hourly pay times 2080. there are 2080 work hours in a typical year so take the hourly pay times 2080. then we will select all from employees there is everybody's salary currently whenever we update an employee's hourly pay I would like to also update the salary automatically with the trigger I don't want to have to calculate every employee's salary manually you know using a calculator like I just did we're going to create a trigger create trigger then we need a name for this trigger before we update the hourly pay we're going to do something I will name this trigger before hourly pay update we'll use either the keyword before or after do you want to do something before or after I would like to do something before before what before an insert before delete before an update before an update in this case on our table employees then add this line for each row we may be working with more than one row using a trigger so that's why we're including this line This trigger can involve one or more rows now what are we going to do before we update an employee's hourly pay let's set the salary equal to the hourly pay times 2080 because there's 2080 work hours in a typical year okay there's one more thing I'm going to add let's prefix salary and hourly pay with this new keyword new DOT salary new DOT hourly pay MySQL doesn't know if we're referring to the old salary and the old hourly pay we're telling MySQL we're calculating a new salary use the new hourly pay when that's changed in place of the old one okay let's take a look let's execute this statement our trigger has been created in your schemas window to find any triggers go to tables then find that table where we applied the trigger employees then triggers I probably need to refresh this there it is before hourly pay update otherwise you can type show triggers and here's our trigger here's the trigger name event update the table the statement and the timing let's select all from employees Mr Krabs is going to give himself an hourly pay raise because he's greedy let's update our employees table set the hourly pay equal to fifty dollars per hour where our employee ID equals one so Mr crab's salary is about fifty three thousand dollars per year before we update it we will change the salary of this employee from fifty three thousand dollars to over six figures 104 000 that change happened automatically with the trigger before updating the employee's hourly pay we calculated a new salary automatically let's make another change let's increase every employee's hourly pay by one dollar per hour Mr Krabs is now feeling generous update employees we will set the hourly pay equal to whatever the hourly pay currently is plus one we will apply this for every employee we don't need a where clause there everybody is now making one more dollar per hour and the salaries reflect that let's create a new trigger we will calculate a salary whenever we insert a new employee more specifically whenever we insert a new hourly pay right now we have a trigger that only kicks in when we update an hourly pay okay let's delete plankton Plankton got fired delete from employees where employee ID equals six select all from employees their Plankton is now gone let's create a trigger create trigger before hourly pay insert are we doing something after or before we're doing something before an event before are we updating inserting or deleting we are inserting before we insert a new record on our table employees for each row let's set the new salary equal to the new hourly pay times 2080. here is our new trigger let's take a look at our employees table select all from employees let's insert a new employee insert into employees values I'm just going to follow these columns employee ID 6. first name is Sheldon last name plankton hourly pay is ten dollars per hour for the salary I'm going to set this to null our trigger will kick in and set that position janitor higher date 2023 January 7th supervisor idea five let's see if our salary is calculated it was Plankton's hourly pay is ten dollars per hour meaning he has a salary of twenty thousand eight hundred dollars per year I do have a few more examples triggers are something you'll want to master they're really helpful we're going to create a new table this time create table expenses our expenses table will have three columns an expense ID the data type will be int this will be the primary key you could set this column to Auto increment if you want but but that's overkill for this topic I would say I'm going to try and keep it simple expense name the data type is varchar 50 is good I suppose then expense total I will set that to be decimal 10 digits Precision of 2 is fine then let's select everything from our table expenses let's insert some values insert into expenses we have three rows one two three ID of one the expense name is salaries for the value for now I'm going to set that to be zero the second row will be two supplies zero ID of three maybe taxes and zero I will calculate the expense total of my salaries bro update expenses I will set the expense total equal to I'll use a nested query select the sum of salary from employees where our expense name column right here is equal to salaries this is all of these salaries combined from the employees table the total is two hundred fifty four thousand two hundred eighty dollars whenever we delete an employee we will update this value found within another table our expenses table so let's create a trigger create trigger after salary delete are we doing something before or after we're doing something after deleting a salary after delete on employees for each row we will update our expenses table and set the expense total equal to whatever the expense total currently is minus that employee's salary if we're deleting a salary we will refer to that salary as the old salary the net aware Clause where expense name equals salaries okay we have created our trigger let's take a look at our expenses table I'm going to delete Plankton again he's fired delete from employees where employee ID equals six that's plankton then select all from expenses look at that our expense total changed it's now two hundred thirty three thousand dollars let's create a trigger that will update our salaries whenever we insert a new employee create trigger after salary insert we're doing something after this time after an insert on our table employees for each row we will update our expenses table we will set the expense total equal to the expense total plus the employee's new salary new DOT salary where expense name equals salaries let's insert a new employee let's take a look at our expenses table select all from expenses we will insert a new employee insert into employees our values employee ID 6. first name is Sheldon last name plankton hourly pay of ten dollars per hour the salary will be null that will be calculated automatically with the trigger position is janitor higher date 2023-01-07 and a supervisor idea5 let's see if this expense total will change which it does when we insert a new employee we're specifically a salary our expense total of salaries will be updated one last example that I promised we're done let's create a trigger that will update this value when we change an employee salary and that will probably be the most complicated one let's create a trigger after salary update we're doing something after we update on our table employees for each row let's update expenses set the expense total equal to the expense total Plus the employee's new salary minus the employee's old salary what's the difference we'll find the difference between the employee's new salary and their old salary add that to the expense total where expense name equals salaries we have created our trigger let's select all from expenses Mr Krabs is going to give himself another pay raise update employees set the hourly pay of Mr Krabs to 100 per hour where employee ID equals one our expense total underneath salaries is now changed it's now 356 thousand two hundred dollars well all right everybody that's a trigger in simple words when an event happens do something such as when we insert update or delete something from a table a few of the benefits is that you can check data handle errors and audit tables it's a really helpful tool to have and well everybody those are triggers in MySQL
7QCHpAtlSMo,Python keyword arguments are awesome! 🗝️,2022-11-30T15:00:06Z,hey friends it's me again today I'm going to explain keyword arguments a keyword argument is an argument preceded by an identifier it has a few benefits it helps with readability and the Order of the arguments doesn't matter if they're keywords keyword arguments are one of four basic styles of arguments we discuss positional default then next we'll discuss arbitrary but today we'll be focusing on keyword suppose I have a function to display a message like a greeting I will name this function the hello function we will need a greeting a title Mr Mrs doctor a first name then a last name all I'm going to do within this function is print an upstring I will print my greeting the user's title first name last name then to invoke the hello function I will need to pass in four arguments a greeting a title a first name and a last name so for my greeting let's say hello the title will be Mr the first name will be SpongeBob last name SquarePants so you know this does work we're currently using positional arguments the position of these arguments does matter so what if I were to switch these around we have hello SpongeBob SquarePants followed by Mr hello SpongeBob SquarePants mister an optional feature when sending arguments to a function is that we could turn these into keyword arguments prefix any arguments with the name of the parameter followed by equals title equals Mr first equal SpongeBob last equal SquarePants then with these keyword arguments the order really doesn't matter maybe we move the first name to the end and the Stillwood printout is the same thing we have title first name last name if you're mixing and matching positional arguments and keyword arguments you want to be sure that the positional arguments are first so if I was to move the string our greeting to the end well this technically wouldn't work we have a syntax error positional arguments follow keyword arguments so make sure any positional arguments are first before using any keyword arguments two helpful benefits of using keyword arguments is that it helps with readability and the Order of the arguments doesn't matter we know what this argument is as well as these two title last name first name let's say we have a first name and a last name John James these two names kind of sound like first names is our first name John or is it James we could use keyword arguments to clarify which is which you thought John was the first name but it's actually the last name and the first name is James then our title is still the same hello Mr James John let's cover another example I'm going to print the numbers 1 through 10 using a for Loop 4 x in range 1 comma 11 because the second argument is exclusive then I will print X after each print statement we print a new line do you remember in previous topics how we would follow our print statement with comma and then a new character such as a space while end is a keyword argument found within the built-in print statement in place of ending each print statement with a new line we are using this keyword argument of end and sending it to be a space another one is separate that's found within the print statement maybe we have some numbers they're all separate strings the numbers one through five I can use the separate keyword argument then separate each of these strings with a given character or characters I will separate each of these strings with a dash a lot of built-in functions such as the print function they have some keyword arguments you can use let's go over an exercise now we're going to create a function to generate a phone number but we'll need to pass in a country code area code the first three digits in the last four digits let's define this function as Define get phone to get a phone number we have a country code area code first meeting first few digits then last meaning last few digits we will return an F string we will place our country code first Dash then our area code Dash the first few digits Dash the last few digits my phone number phone num equals I will invoke the get phone number function we just created but we'll need a country code an area code first few digits then last few digits and remember the order doesn't necessarily matter usually I try and be consistent with the order of the parameters make up a phone number I'm in the United States my country code is one area code one two three the next few digits will be four five six the last few will be seven eight nine zero then let's print this phone number print phone num and here's my phone number although you can change it up based on how you do phone numbers in your country this is typically how you would see a phone number in the United States alright everybody so those are keyword arguments they are just arguments preceded by an identifier that matches the name of a function's parameters it does help with readability and the Order of the arguments doesn't matter when invoking a function it could be helpful to identify some of these arguments and well everybody those are keyword arguments in Python
89cGQjB5R4M,Functions in Python are easy 📞,2022-11-26T15:00:05Z,hey everybody today I need to explain functions think of a function as a block of reusable code to invoke a function you place a set of parentheses after the function name to invoke it here's a scenario I need to sing Happy Birthday three times I know it's a weird example but it makes a lot of sense just trust me on this if I need to sing Happy Birthday three times I would write something like this I'm going to create my own version of the Happy Birthday song thank you this is one verse if I need to repeat this code three times without using functions I could either repeat this code or maybe place it within a loop so here's my Happy Birthday song three times but there's a better way of handling this that doesn't involve repeating our code or using Loops what if I could write this code once then reuse it whenever I need to that's where functions come in to define a function you would type def then a unique function name let's name this function the happy birthday function add a set of parentheses a colon any code that belongs to the function you'll want to indent underneath then to invoke this function I would type the name of the function happy birthday add a set of parentheses and that's it when you invoke this function you will execute this code once if I need to execute this code three times I would just call it two more times happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday to invoke a function you type the function name then add a set of parentheses I like to think of the parentheses as a pair of telephones talking to each other you call a function to invoke it hey happy birthday function execute your code with functions you are able to send data directly to a function using what are known as arguments you can send values or variables directly to a function place any data within the set of parentheses I'll send my function a first name any data you send a function are known as arguments but you need a matching set of parameters that are in order what exactly is the data we're sending in well it's a name I will add one parameter to my happy birthday function I will name this data name a parameter is kind of like a temporary variable that's used within a function I'm going to replace this instance of U with a name I will use an F string replace you with the placeholder I will add my parameter name so happy birthday to bro we could pass in some other names what about Steve and Joe here we are happy birthday to bro happy birthday to Steve happy birthday to Joe when you invoke a function you can send more than one argument let's send an age this time I'll send 20 30. and 40. but when I run this we have an error we're passing in two arguments but our function is set up only to take one I would need a matching number of arguments to invoke this function we will need two parameters we have a name and we have an age then let's use this age you are let's make this line enough string age years old let's try that again happy birthday to bro you are 20 years old happy birthday to Steve you are 30 years old happy birthday to Joe you are 40 years old when you invoke a function you can pass in some data those are known as arguments but you'll need a matching set of parameters the order does matter let's see what happens when I switch these two parameters age then name happy birthday 220 you are bro years old happy birthday 230 you are Steve years old happy birthday 240 you are Joe years old so the position of the parameters does matter same thing goes with the arguments you also could name these parameters something unique maybe X and Y happy birthday to X you are y years old that's also valid let's try another example I'm going to create a function to display an invoice there will be three parameters a username and amount and a due date let's print hello I should make this an F string username we'll use another F string your bill of amount let's precede this placeholder with the unit of currency I will also add a format specifier 0.2 f is do on our due date whatever that parameter is to invoke this function we will type the function's name add a set of parentheses a username and a mount and a due date let's make up some username and amount I guess 42.50 I'm just making up a number here then a due date the first of January I guess here is my invoice hello bro code here bill of 42.50 is due on January 1st let's change these arguments Joe schmoe is the username he owes 100 and one penny due on the first of February or January 2nd depending on how you read dates in your region hello Joe schmoe your bill of 100 and one cent is due on one slash two that's another example now we need to explain the return statement return is a statement that is used to end a function and send a result back to the caller here's an example we have a variable z z will equal will invoke a function to add two numbers together such as the numbers one and two when we invoke a function we can send some data back after adding one and two we will send the result which would be three then this value can be assigned to a variable then we can print whatever Z is so let's create some functions let's create a function to add two numbers together the parameters will be X and Y let's say Z equals X Plus y then we will return our value Z so I'm not going to print Z directly right now let's subtract X and Y subtract Z equals x minus y return Z multiply times y then divide x divided by y return Z let's invoke our add function pass in two numbers one and two then I'm going to print the result after adding these two numbers together the result is three what about subtract subtract one and two the result is negative one multiply the result is 2. then divide 1 divided by 2 is 0.5 after we resolve this function a value is returned just imagine that after we finish this function this function becomes whatever is returned three this function becomes negative one this function becomes two this function becomes 0.5 let's write something a little more complex we will create a function to create a full name create name we'll need two parameters for a first name and a last name I'll name these first and last what do we want to do within this function let's capitalize the user's first name first equals first dot capitalize method then do the same thing with the last name last equals last dot capitalize then I'm going to return the user's first name plus their last name then I'll add a space in between their first and last name this is also valid outside of the function let's create a full name variable that invoke the create name function so this function is going to capitalize the first and last name for us I'll type in my first name all lowercase same thing with my last name then let's print our full name and here is my full name variable we sent our function some arguments we have some parameters set up we took those values made them uppercase then concatenated these strings together then returned them as a single string let's try this with a different name SpongeBob SquarePants SpongeBob now has a full name the first and last names are now capitalized using the return statement you can return some data back to the place in which you call a function well everybody that's a function it's a section of reusable code to call a function you type the function's name add a set of parentheses you can send a function some data which are known as arguments but you'll need a matching set of parameters you also do have the option of returning some data back to the place in which you invoke a function we'll be using functions a lot in the future but we will get more practice with them and those are functions in Python
oagHZwY9JJY,MySQL: STORED PROCEDURES,2022-11-22T14:11:01Z,why hello again it's me so today I gotta explain stored procedures a stored procedure is prepared SQL code that you can save it's great if there's a query that you write often for example I have this statement it's very verbose there's a lot we have to write if this statement is something I have to write often I could save it and reuse it later this statement will interjoin the transactions table and my customers table then display all customers that made a transaction this statement is very verbose if I have to write the statement often I could save it as a stored procedure I can refer to the nickname that I gave that snippet of code the name I gave this procedure was get customers then I need to call this stored procedure and that does the same thing and it's a lot less to write there's also a few other benefits which we'll discuss at the end of the video let's begin with something simple I would like to select all from my customers table to turn the statement or statements into a stored procedure I will type create procedure then a name for the statement or statements I will name this statement get customers add a set of parentheses type the keyword begin wherever your statement or statements end type end then for clarity I'm going to tab all of my statements between begin and end so we have a problem we're trying to create this procedure however MySQL is stopping at this semicolon here we end all statements with a semicolon rather than at the end our semicolon is known as a delimiter it's kind of like the period at the end of a sentence we're telling MySQL that our statement ends here but we need our statement to end here after the end keyword we can actually change the delimiter temporarily type delimiter before we create the procedure typically when people change their delimiter temporarily they'll either use two forward slashes or two dollar signs I'll stick with the dollar signs because I think that's cooler after we create our procedure let's change our delimiter back to the semicolon MySQL no longer recognizes our semicolon as the delimiter after the end keyword I will use our new delimiter to end this statement that should work now let's execute the statement we have created our procedure I'm going to refresh my navigator window underneath stored procedures we have our stored procedure of get customers to invoke the stored procedure type call the name of the procedure get customers add a set of parentheses then a semicolon that will execute whatever code you stored within your stored procedure to drop a stored procedure you would type drop procedure the name of the procedure get customers let's try another example this time we will send our procedure a piece of data within the set of parentheses a customer ID number such as 1 2 3 4 so on and so forth we will get a customer by their customer ID we will create a procedure I will name this procedure find customer add a set of parentheses to find a customer by their customer ID when we invoke the stored procedure within the set of parentheses we will need to place a customer ID but when we create the stored procedure we have to set up what is called a parameter we will type in then a nickname for that piece of data we're passing in a transaction ID I'll give this parameter a nickname of ID then we need the data type of what we're passing in we're passing in an integer so we have one parameter set up let's use that begin keyword that end keyword list our statement or statements between these two keywords I will select all from my customers table where my customer ID equals the ID that we pass in that nickname we need to change the delimiter because MySQL thinks we're trying to end our statement here but we need it to end after the end keyword so let's change the delimiter to double dollar signs then change it back all right we have created that stored procedure let's invoke it call find customer within the set of parentheses we need to pass in a customer ID number let's pass in one that would give us Fred fish two is Larry Lobster three is bubble Bass five is Pearl crabs when you invoke a stored procedure you can pass in some data depending on what you need exactly for your stored procedure let's drop this procedure then do one last example drop procedure find customer [Music] this time we will send two arguments two pieces of data a first name and a last name create procedure find customer within our set of parentheses the first piece of data we'll pass in will be a first name but first is already a keyword maybe F name meaning first name then the data type let's see for customers the data type of first and last names is varchar50 varchar 50. for your next piece of data you would separate that with a comma in our nickname will be lname for last name data type is varchar 50. then I'm just going to put that on a new line for clarity type the begin keyword and write your statements between begin and end we will select all from our customers table where first name equals the name of the data that we pass in and last name equals the other piece of data the second piece the last name again we need to change the delimiter to create this procedure double dollar signs then change it back we have created our stored procedure let's invoke it call find customer within the set of parentheses we will list a first name and a last name Larry comma Lobster get Larry Lobster's information let's find him and there he is customer id2 first name Larry last name Lobster referral ID of one email is L Lobster gmail.com all right everybody that is a sword procedure it's prepared SQL code that you can save it's great if there's a query that you write often a few of the benefits is that it reduces Network traffic it increases performance and is more secure and administrator can grant permission to a user or an application to use a stored procedure one of the downsides though is that it increases memory usage of every connection and well everybody those are stored procedures in MySQL
6FwQBS3jV_I,MySQL: ROLLUP,2022-11-20T15:38:25Z,hey again it's me today I'm going to be explaining the roll-up claws like a fruit roll-up it's an extension of the group by Clause it produces another row and shows the grand total it's also known as a super aggregate value here's an example I have a table of transactions what I would like to do is to group each transaction by the order date then produce a grant total here's what we'll do I'll give you a few different examples let's begin by selecting the sum of the amounts and the order date from our table transactions then we will Group by the order date and there we are we have the sum of every amount per order date using this roll-up Clause I can add an additional row that shows a grand total so to say all I have to do after the group by Clause is ADD with rollup and there you go here's the grand total 7.88 plus 8.37 plus 8.97 is 25.22 here's another example let's count the transaction ideas buy order date we have two transactions on the first two on the second three on the third for a total of seven transactions I'll give you two more examples let's select the count of our transaction ideas per customer I'm going to give this count an alias as number of orders as well as the customer ID column from our table transactions we will Group by customer ID let's see what we have so far then I will add with roll up here are the amount of orders per customer ID the customer with an ID of 3 has visited here more than once the grand total of the number of orders is seven that's the roll up one last example let's select our employees table select all from employees we will group all of these employees by their employee ID then display a roll-up of all of the hourly pay as a business how much are we spending on all of our employees per hour so let's select the sum of our hourly pay I'll give this an alias as hourly pay I guess it really isn't different from the column name we will display the employee ID as a column from our table employees Group by the employee ID with rollup here's the hourly pay of each employee as well as a grand total if all of our employees are working currently we are spending as a business 92.75 cents per hour well yeah that's the roll-up Clause everybody it's an extension of the group by Clause it produces another row and shows essentially the grand total it's also known as a super aggregate value to include a roll-up after the group by Clause just add with rollup it's probably good for accounting and well yeah that's the roll-up clause in MySQL
x-Ag2_bJ40Y,Code a dice roller program in 10 minutes! 🎲,2022-11-16T16:33:31Z,hello everybody today we will be creating a dice roller program in Python we will be utilizing some ASCII art I'll post all of the ASCII art that we'll need in the description of this video you can copy and paste it to save time if you'd like all right let's get started everybody we will Begin by importing the random module because we will be rolling some random numbers between one through six if we're going to create some ASCII art we'll be utilizing Unicode characters to enter in a Unicode character it really varies depending on your operating system I think the easiest way would just be to use Python to enter a Unicode character type a forward slash then a given code for each character here are all of the codes that we'll need after writing these seven Unicode characters let's run this program these symbols that are output let's copy them I'll add them to a comment then we can delete this line these are the Unicode characters we'll need to build some ASCII art some dice each die will be made out of five lines let's begin with the first we'll need a left corner nine dashes then the right corner for the second line copy this vertical bar add nine spaces then a vertical bar we can copy this whole line paste it two times let's use the left bottom corner add a nine of these dashes then the bottom right corner and here's a basic box shape depending on what the number die is we can add one of these bullet points for a one we can add that right to the middle so that's good for now we'll delete this later let's create a dictionary I will name this dictionary dice art our dictionary is made out of key value pairs so the keys will be the numbers one through six beginning with one the value will be a tuple it's a dictionary made out of key value pairs where the value is a tuple within the Tuple let's add these lines each separated with the comma I'm going to format these so they form a box shape let's take our bullet point place it right in the middle then add a comma to the end of this key value pair that is the first key value pair let's copy all of this paste it again change one to two let's move this bullet point we need two bullet points about right here and here let's repeat this process for Keys three through six be sure to get rid of the comma at the end and here is our dictionary of Dysart each key is a number each value is a tuple made of strings let's create a list of dice our dice will be numbers randomly generated between one and six a total to calculate the total I'll set that to be zero then we will ask a user for a number of dice this will be some input how many dice then Typecast the input as an integer we don't want somebody to write you know 2.5 dice you can't roll half a die to generate a random number you can use the Rand int method of the random module we need a random number between one and six then we need to append this number to our list of dice dice dot append then we can move this line to within the append method we need to do this a number of times depending on how many dice the user enters in we can place this line within a for Loop for every die in our range number of dice this will be a number let's print our list of dice to see what numbers we have in here how many dice I would like five dice five three three four six okay we know that that works let's calculate a total we'll need to iterate and sum all of the elements within our list we can do that with the for Loop for every die in our list dice take our total variable plus equals the current value within our dice then we will print a total I'll use an F string total colon space our total variable let's see what we have so far how many dice I would like five dice our total is 19. now between these two for Loops we will display our ASCII art the easiest way would be to create some nested for loops the outer for Loop will be in charge of the number of dice for every die in our range number of dice the inner for Loop will be in charge of printing every Tuple for every line in than to get a value in our dictionary we would type the name of the dictionary dice art then use the get method what are we getting we're getting a value at a given key let's take our list of numbers dice at index of die our counter depending on what the user types in for the number of dice dye will begin at 1 then increment within the inner for Loop we will print the line so let's take a look how many dice I would like three dice and here's our ASCII art six plus two plus four that equals 12. if you would prefer we can display all of these dice on a single horizontal line instead of one vertical line it's a little more tricky though if you would prefer that approach let's turn this chunk of code into comments we will write this nested Loop a little different so each Tuple is made up of five elements right so if we're printing a horizontal line let's say we roll the numbers one through three we would first need to display this line of the first dice then the first line of the second dice then the first line of the third dice during the next iteration of the outer loop we would display the second line of the first dice the second line of the second dice the second line of the third dice so it's a little more complex let's create an outer loop that will iterate five times for every line in range five then the nested Loop will be for every die in dice how many dice do we have within our list we will print we're going to get one of the values found at one of the numbers that we roll take our dictionary of Dysart dot get then a number one through six that will be the value found within our list of dice get the current die remember that this is a number one through six we would then need one of the elements found within our Tuple so get the first line then the second line third fourth fifth so let's add the index operator place our counter of line within the index operator let's see what we have so far we need to add one more thing how many dice three this is an Abomination there's one more change we need to make at the end of our print statement let's set the ending character to be an empty string and that should fix that how many dice three okay we're getting better results then when we escape the inner loop we will print a new line how many dice three and there we are three plus six plus one is ten all right everybody so that is a dice roller program it is kind of complex but I thought this might be a good exercise if you would like a copy of this code I will post all of this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's a dice roller program in Python
fn68QNcatfo,ROCK PAPER SCISSORS game in Python 🗿,2022-11-14T17:12:42Z,hey everybody in today's topic I thought we would create a game of rock paper scissors now that we know how the random module Works let's begin by importing the random module we will create some options we will use a tuple we're not going to be changing the options so a tuple would be better than a list we have three options Rock paper or scissors I'll create a variable named player to store the Player's Choice for now I'm going to set this to be none as well as a computer our computer is going to pick a random Choice from these options rock paper or scissors in order to do so we can use the choice method of the random module random dot choice pick a random Choice from options let's have the player enter in some input enter a choice Rock paper scissors then we will display the Player's Choice and the computer's choice I'll use an upstring player colon space the variable player it's copy that paste it then change player to computer let's see what we have so far enter a choice rock paper scissors so I pick Rock the computer picks scissors let's try it again just for good measure I pick paper this time the computer picks scissors I pick scissors the computer picks paper okay we know that the computer is successfully picking a random Choice from our options now what if the player picks something that's not within this Tuple such as the gun well we would want to stop that right we need the user to pick a valid option only rock paper or scissors I think what we'll do is that when we accept user input let's place it within a while loop so indent this line while this condition is going to be kind of weird while our player variable is not in our Tuple options let's try this again to see what happens I pick the gun enter a choice all right well if I can't pick a gun how about a sponge well I can't pick that either Rock that works our condition is while the player variable is not found within our options if the player doesn't pick one of these options this while loop will continue forever once we pick something that's within our options we then escape the while loop let's check some win conditions now if the player is equal to computer that means it's a tie I will print it's a tie I'll add a few lcip statements else if the player is equal to rock I'll use the and logical operator and the computer is equal to scissors that means you win let's print you win let's add another condition else if the player picks paper and the computer picks Rock then you also win you win L Sif the player picks scissors and the computer and the computer picks paper then we will print you win else if the Player's Choice is not the same as the computers and we don't meet any win conditions that must mean we lose print you lose let's see if this works enter a choice rock paper scissors I pick the gun nope I can't pick that I pick Rock I pick Rock the computer picks scissors you win let me see if I can lose I'll pick paper you win again scissors I need to stop winning I need to see if the loose condition works okay it's a tie at least but I need to lose all right there we go I pick Rock the computer picks paper you lose what if the user would like to play again let's place all of this code within a while loop let's do so right about here now I'm not going to write while true like I normally do this time I'm going to create a variable let's say running is our game running I will set that to be true while running equals true or we could shorten this to just while running that's simpler I will place all of this code within the while loop to mass indent some code just highlight all of the code and then press tab hey everybody this is bro from the future I forgot to explain something the reason I'm not setting the condition of my while loop to be true is that if you have a lot of code within a while loop it can be really difficult to find where the break statement is if I set my condition to be a Boolean variable such as running it's a lot easier to find any instance where I use this variable if I were to highlight it we can see that running is found down here if I need to change any instance of this variable and rename it to something you can refactor let's rename running as maybe playing then I will refactor so my variable running is now playing and that change was made down here too so it's a coding preference every time we start a new game I will reset the player as well as the computer let's move these two lines into the while loop at the beginning so when we start a new game we will reset the player the computer will pick a new random choice so let's see what we have so far Rock I pick Rock the computer picks Rock it's a tie then we have to play again so paper you lose scissors it's a tie now what if we would like to escape the while loop after our win conditions I'm going to create a temporary variable let's name this play again then we will ask for some user input play again question mark y slash n meaning yes or no if the user types in something that's capital I'm going to use the lower method to make it lowercase so if our play again variable is equal to y we would like to escape what I would like to do is I would like to see if the player types in something that's not why I will precede this condition with the not logical operator if the user does not want to play again then let's take our Boolean variable running normally it's true and set that to be false running equals false that means we will escape the while loop once we escape the while loop I will print thanks for playing now I'm going to change this momentarily I just want to test it Rock play again yes paper play again yes scissors you lose play again nope thanks for playing this is entirely optional I try and create as few variables as possible I would personally rather avoid creating a variable here another way in which I could write this is that I can get rid of this variable let's move if not in front of the input and follow our input here then use the comparison operator then add a colon if the user's input after making it lowercase does not equal a y for yes set running to be false so that should work the same Rock play again yes enter a choice paper play again no thanks for playing this line would work the same but it's a little more complex for beginners to read or you can use the other method that I showed you alright everybody well that's a game of rock paper scissors
piJc18hcH0Y,Generate random numbers in Python 🎲,2022-11-12T15:30:18Z,well hello again everybody it's me in today's topic I'm going to show you how we can generate some random numbers in Python then at the end of this video as an exercise we're going to create a number guessing program let's begin we will be importing the random module type import random the random module gives us access to a lot of useful methods involving random numbers for a comprehensive list you can use the help function pass in the random module and then we would want to print this here's what we all have access to we have a shuffle method set state seed sample random range random random inch random bytes and there's a ton of others but we'll discuss a few of the more useful methods for beginners for a random whole integer maybe you're rolling a six-sided dice you would type the name of the random module dot that a method for a random whole integer type Rand int add a set of parentheses within the set of parentheses you will list a range if I'm rolling a six-sided dice I would like the numbers one through six one comma six then I will assign what is returned to maybe a variable print whatever my number is my random number is a four three one four all right I tend to play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons we use polyhedral dice that have more or less than six sides there is a 20-sided dice for a random number between 1 and 20 I would set the range to be one comma 20. here I rolled a 16. and a seven and an eight within the Rand int method you can place variables as well as long as they contain numbers I will create a variable named low I'll set that equal to one and a variable named High I will set that to be 100. I will replace the numbers with my variables that behave as numbers give me a random integer between my low variable and high variable so between 1 and 100 in this example I have rolled a 75. now in 88 if you need a random floating Point number you can use the random method random dot random then let's assign this to a variable number equals the random method of the random module that would return a random floating Point number between 0 and 1. you can pick a random Choice from a sequence in the future we're going to create a game of rock paper scissors let's say we have a tuple of options options equals Rock paper scissors we are accessing the random module dot then use the choice method place your sequence within the choice method give me a random Choice from options I will store this within a variable let's say option equals random Choice from my options then I will print the option our computer has generated scissors paper Rock so the choice method is a great use for games if you ever need a random element now there's also Shuffle this time maybe we have a deck of cards cards equals I guess I'll use a list this time I have a list of cards that you would normally find within a deck of playing cards well besides the suit two through ten Jack queen king Ace using the shuffle method I can Shuffle this sequence access the random module dot Shuffle pass in your sequence in my case it's cards then I will print cards yeah look at that my cards are now shuffled in the future we'll be creating a game of blackjack the shuffle method will be used then to shuffle our deck of cards those are a few methods found within the random module for some practice let's create a number guessing game as an exercise a user has to guess a number between a certain range maybe between 1 and 100 I'll set low to be one High to be 100 guesses set to zero then we will generate a random number equals random dot Rand int the range is between our variables low and high we'll create a while loop while true while the user guesses the wrong number we'll have to continue the while loop we only Escape when they get the right number but we'll give them a hint so guess equals input I'll use an F string enter a number between low through High I'm going to surround this with a set of parentheses then I'm going to Typecast our input as an integer after making one guess I will increment our guesses variable by one guesses plus equals one now if our guess is less than our number let's print using an F string guess is too low else if gas is greater than our number we will print I'm just going to copy this is to hi then else if our guess is not lower than the number and our guess is not higher than the number well then our guess must equal the number that means we got the number right then I will print guess is correct then we will break so when we escape the while loop let's print the number of guesses it took to get the right number I'll use an upstring this round took you our guesses variable then the word guesses that should complete our program let's try it enter a number between 1 and 100 I'll guess something right in the middle 50. 50 is too high okay so our number is between 1 and 50. I'll guess something in the middle of that range maybe 25 25 is still too high 12. 12 is too high six is too low okay we know our number is between 6 and 12. nine nine is correct this round took you five guesses well okay then everybody that is how to work with random numbers in Python and hopefully you gained a little bit of experience working with random numbers with this number guessing game we'll be utilizing random numbers for a lot of games in the future and well yeah that's how to work with random numbers in Python
PbkIzW_70EI,Python concession stand program 🍿,2022-11-11T15:00:29Z,hey everybody today we will be creating a program to mimic a concession stand much like what you would see at a movie theater we will be utilizing a dictionary to keep track of a menu item and an Associated price more or less this is just a program to help us get used to working with dictionaries let's begin we'll create a dictionary named menu what items are on the menu we'll need an item and a price I'll think of some I'm going to speed up this video feel free to pause if you need more time and here's my menu everybody I thought of a few food items you might find at a movie theater concession stand pizza nachos popcorn fries chips soft pretzels soda lemonade movie theater popcorn is really expensive for some reason okay we have our menu a user is going to select specific keys from this menu depending on what the key is we can get the associated value to calculate a total to keep track of the user selected items I will create an empty list named cart I will also declare a variable named to Total to keep track of the total we need to lay this dictionary down flat to display it to a user well we do have the items method of a dictionary which we covered in the last video for every key value in our dictionary menu dot items method the items method of our dictionary will return a key and a value during each iteration I'm simply going to print every key and value I'll use an F string I will print every key colon space then a value let's take a look so far here's our menu I'll make a few changes the price will be in dollars and cents but feel free to pick your own unit of currency I'll precede my value with the dollar sign then using a format specifier I will display two decimal places 0.2 f that's better I will line up all the keys after the key I will add a format specifier then allocate 10 spaces yeah look at that it's all lined up now before and after displaying our menu with this for loop I will add some decorative text let's say menu then outside of the for Loop I'll display a bunch of dashes yeah look at that let's move on to the next step we will ask a user for some input what item would they like to buy from the menu while our condition will be true if our condition is set to True we'll need to break out of this Loop one way or another we will ask for some user input food equals input select an item Q2 quit if food is equal to a lowercase Q then we will break Let's test it select an item Pizza nachos soda Q to quit yeah it works okay what if the user types in capital Q well we can't escape the while loop if a user types in capital Q we're assuming that they would like to quit when we accept our user input I'm going to add dot lower method this will take our user input and make it all lowercase so we should be able to acknowledge any uppercase letters yeah it works cool let's add an elseif statement what if a user types in an item that's not on our menu well there is a get method of dictionaries if menu dot get pass in our food which is user input if the user selection is not within our menu as a key it will return none so we can use that else if menu dot get food is not none then we would like to append that food item to our cart cart dot append our food item so outside of the while loop I'm going to print our cart temporarily just to test it okay select an item Pizza soda pretzel how about a potato cuticquit we have our pizza soda and pretzel but not our potato we don't want that in our cart because that's not on the menu yeah you can just add that line else if menu item dot get food is not none that will complete our while loop let's calculate a total for every food in our cart let's take our total variable set this equal to total plus then we need a value associated with a key Plus menu dot get method get the food item found within our cart but I'm going to shorten this to Total plus equals menu dot get the value associated with this food in our cart I will also display that food item print food I'm going to avoid printing our food item on every line I will set the ending character in our print statement just to be a space okay let's see what we have so far I would like popcorn soda pretzel cue to quit popcorn soda pretzel then we will display the total I will print a new line print I'll use an upstring total is add a unit of currency total I'll add a format specifier 0.2 F to display two decimal places I'm going to add one line of decorative text let's copy maybe this all right let's test it out select an item popcorn pretzel soda potato quit all right here's our cart popcorn pretzel soda we did not include the potato that was not found within our dictionary the total is twelve dollars and fifty cents well there you have it everybody that is a concession stand program the point of this program was to help us get used to working with dictionaries a dictionary is a collection of key value pairs such as an item and a price and yeah that's a concession standard program in Python
gOMW_n2-2Mw,"Python lists, sets, and tuples explained 🍍",2022-11-04T14:23:00Z,well hello everybody today I will be explaining a few different types of collections in Python there's four general purpose collections three of them are lists sets and tuples there are also dictionaries but I'll save that for the next topic because they can be kind of tricky a collection I would think of them as a single variable and I'm saying that within quotes that is used to store multiple values that's how I would explain a collection to a beginner for example let's say we have a variable variable fruit fruit equals some value like Apple and then I can print this fruit which is Apple I could turn this variable into a collection by surrounding my values with either a set of square brackets for a list curly braces for a set or parentheses for a tuple let's begin with the list if I would like to store more than one value in this variable I will surround my values with a set of square brackets this variable is now a list I can store multiple values separated with the comma not only do we have an apple in this variable but we have an orange a banana and coconut one naming convention that I like to use if I declare a collection such as a list set or Tuple I like to take the variable name and make it plural just so that it's more obvious that this is a collection of values technically in the English language fruit would still be plural English is a weird language we now have a list of fruit named fruits if I were to print my list this is the result we have all of our values enclosed with a set of square brackets to access one of these elements found within your list you can use the index operator much like what we can do with strings the first element would have an index of zero that would print my value Apple index of one would be my orange two is banana three coconut what about four we don't have a value there list index out of range each value in a collection is also known as an element if we attempt to access an element that's not found within our collection you'll run into an index error with the index operator you could set a beginning index an ending index and a step I would like the first three elements you could say zero colon three that would give me Apple orange banana technically you don't even need the zero you need that colon though we can even use a step I would like every second element apple banana it's every second element beginning from index zero maybe I would like my fruit backwards I'll set the step to be negative one coconut banana orange Apple you can use the index operator with collections much like you can use with strings another cool thing you can do too with collections is that you can iterate over them with the for Loop four x in my collection fruits what would we like to do I will print whatever X is so we have iterated over our list Apple orange banana coconut now X isn't really too descriptive what you'll see some people do is that with their collection name it's plural their counter will be the singular version of that word if our collection name is fruits let's rename X as fruit singular it's not mandatory but that's a common convention it's more readable that way for every fruit in fruits If This Were cars you could say for car in Cars our counter is storing whatever value is within our collection so what are all the different methods that we can use with collections to list the different methods that are available to a collection you can use the dir function within this function add your collection fruits but we would need to print this let's surround this function with a print statement these are all in alphabetical order we have attributes which I have not explained yet but I will in a future topic but if we scroll to the end we have a bunch of different methods that this list can perform append clear copy account extend index insert pop remove reverse and sort if you would like a description of each of these methods there is a help function help add your collection to the parentheses then we would need to print this here's the description of all the methods and attributes for example we have our sort method and here's a description sort the list in ascending order and return none and then a bunch of other stuff if you ever forget what you're capable of with a list or other collection you can always use the help function to print a description of the attributes and methods available if you need the length of how many elements are within a collection there is the length function return the length of my list fruits then let's print it there's four elements within my list the length function returns four if I were to add an extra element like a pineapple then that number would be five let's remove that using the in operator we can find if a value is within a collection is our value Apple in fruits but then we would need to print this this operator will return a Boolean so let's print whatever that is is Apple in fruits that is true but is pineapple pineapple is not it's false you can use the in operator to find if a value is within a list and that applies for your other collections too with lists they're ordered and changeable duplicates are okay we can change one of these values after we create our list let's take fruits at index of zero I will set the sequel to be a pineapple then let's iterate over our fruit using a for Loop okay the first element is no longer an apple it's a pineapple then orange banana coconut using an index you can reassign one of the values if I were to change zero to one well now we have an apple pineapple banana coconut let's cover some of the methods that are found within a list we can append an element type the name of the list dot append what would we like to append to the end of this list let's append a pineapple I'm going to get rid of this for Loop I'm just going to display my list there we have an apple an orange banana coconut pineapple to add an element to the end of a list use the append method to remove an element you can use the remove method Roots dot remove let's remove our Apple our apple is no longer there we have an orange banana coconut using the insert method we can insert a value at a given index fruits dot insert list and index 0 would be the beginning then a value pineapple now we have a pineapple Apple orange banana coconut the sort method will sort a list fruits.sort these are all in alphabetical order now apple banana coconut orange to reverse a list you would use the reverse method fruits.reverse coconut banana orange Apple however these are not in Reverse alphabetical order these elements are reversed based on the order in which we place them if you would like reverse alphabetical order you can first sort and then reverse now we have orange coconut banana apple to clear a list use the clear method fruits.clear all of the elements are gone we can return the index of a value let's return the index of Apple fruits Dot index list and element then we will need to print this let's print the index that is returned the index of Apple is zero coconut that would be three what if we don't find a value like a pineapple well we have an error pineapple is not in list you could count the amount of times that a value is found within a list because duplicates are okay fruits dot count let's count how many bananas are in this list banana then print it one banana is found within this list how about pineapples there are zero now those are lists surround your values with a set of square brackets these values are ordered and changeable duplicates are okay now let's talk about the next collection which is a set to create a set surround your values instead with a set of curly braces our collection of fruits is now a set a set has different benefits the values are unordered and immutable meaning we can't alter these values however we can add and remove elements a set does not include any duplicates I'm going to delete these methods then print fruits we have all of the same values but they're not in the same order as they were originally a set is unordered if I were to run this again they will likely be in a different order see now we have a banana apple coconut orange to display all of the different attributes and methods of a set you can use the Der function and here's all of them some of these methods are a little more advanced but there's a few we might recognize like add clear copy for an in-depth description of these methods you can use the help function much like what we did before to find the length of our set we can use the length function which is for we can use the in operator to find if a value is found within the set unfortunately pineapples are not within our set now if I was to use the index operator of my set this is what would happen we have an error set object is not subscriptable we're not able to use indexing on a set because they're unordered much like what we can do with a list or a string we can't change the values of a set but we could add or remove elements let's use the add method to add guess what a pineapple that is okay orange Apple pineapple coconut banana we can remove an element fruits dot remove D let's remove our Apple our apple is gone coconut orange banana pop the pop method will remove whatever element is first but it's going to be random though orange coconut banana Apple coconut banana apple banana coconut you can clear fruits dot clear the elements of our set are gone those are a few of the more useful methods for beginners as a summary a set is a collection that is unordered and immutable you can't change the values but adding and removing elements is okay no duplicates are allowed let's try that real quick I'm going to add a second coconut yeah see we only still have one coconut sets may work well if you're working with Constance maybe colors for example you need to find if a color is within a set all right now lastly let's talk about tuples a tuple is a collection that is surrounded with a set of parentheses tuples are ordered and unchangeable duplicates are okay one benefit of a tuple over a list is that tuples are faster than lists if you're working with a collection and it's okay if the collection is ordered and unchangeable you might as well use a tuple because it's faster when I print our Tuple all of these values are surrounded with a set of parentheses again we have the dur function to display the attributes and methods there's not as many for a tuple for methods we only have count and index again there's also help to display a description of these attributes and methods you can find the length of a tuple with the length function we have five elements within here using the in operator we can find if a value is found within our Tuple our pineapple is not within our fruits so there's only two methods we have access to let's find the index of Apple fruits.index Apple then I will print whatever is returned apple is found at index 0. there is also count fruits dot count how many coconuts are found within our Tuple fruits count the Coconuts then print this how many coconuts we have two coconuts and then again with any of these collections they're iterable so you can iterate over them using a for Loop for fruit and fruits yep Apple orange banana coconut coconut all right everybody so those are collections think of them as a single variable used to store multiple values there's four general purpose collections for beginners lists sets tuples and then dictionaries which we'll talk about next each of them has unique benefits lists are ordered and changeable duplicates are okay a set is unordered and immutable but adding and removing elements is okay no duplicates allowed a tuple is ordered and unchangeable duplicates are okay and they are faster than lists use tuples if you can over a list but yeah those are a few collections in Python
q-kZ8Rq58MY,MySQL LIMIT clause is easy,2022-11-03T10:55:05Z,hello it's me again today I will be explaining the limit Clause the limit Clause is used to limit the number of records that are quarried it's very useful if you're working with a lot of data one use is that you can display a large data set on different pages also known as pagination here's an example I have a few customers not very many I'm working with a small data set if I would ever need to limit the amount of customers that are displayed I can add a limit Clause then set how many I would like to display I would like the first customer limit one that would return Fred fish in my example if I need the first two that would be Fred then Larry three is Fred Larry bubble that's kind of a weird first name and then four would be poppy currently these records are organized by customer ID we could combine the limit Clause with the order by clause let's order by last name then limit one that would return bubble bass it's in alphabetical order or we could do last name descending limit one poppy puff has the name and least alphabetical order I guess basically speaking limit limits the number of records that are returned it's very useful in combination with the order by clause which we learned about in the previous topic now with the limit Clause you can add an offset limit one one the first number is the offset limit to one record after the first that should technically return Larry Lobster yep Larry so limit two would add an offset of two which returns bubble Bass limit three would return poppy puff using an offset would be very helpful when working with a large data set if you need to display your records on different pages suppose that our data set is maybe 100 customers I need to display 10 customers per page so the first 10 would be just limit 10. but you know my data set's really small so it's not going to be apparent if I need the next set of 10 customers I can add an offset of 10. although I don't have that many customers to begin with the next set of 10 customers would be an offset of 20 then displayed 10 you know then 30 40 so on and so forth so yeah that's the limit Clause you will limit the results that are queried type limit then some number you could add an offset so display some number of Records after an offset but yeah that is the limit clause in MySQL
R-5F3BF8IeY,MySQL ORDER BY clause is easy,2022-11-02T20:52:09Z,hey everyone I have a super quick video on the order by Clause the order by Clause sorts the results of a query in either ascending or descending order based on which column we list here's an example I have a list of employees how can I list all of these employees alphabetically currently they are listed by their employee ID well at the end of my statement I can add an order by Clause order buy then a column to order our Rose by let's order all of these employees by their last name Now by default they will be ordered in ascending order or alphabetical order if you're working with characters for descending order or reverse alphabetical order just add dese for descending now these employees are listed in Reverse alphabetical order or descending order for us sending order that would be ASC but that is the default so you don't explicitly need ASC let's order these employees by their first name first name these employees are listed alphabetically by their first name let's do reverse alphabetical order yeah there we are let's order these employees by their higher date higher date and ascending order you don't even technically need that keyword ascending it would still work just fine now descending I think we have the hang of it now let's select all from transactions there's one more thing I want to show you select all from transactions we have two transactions with the same amount let's order by amount when ordering a column if two values share the same amount we can add an additional column to compare by order by amount but if two amounts are the same order by maybe customer ID these two rows are now flipped so you can order by more than one column if two columns share the same amount then order by some other column then you can add ascending descending however you want to order your table so yeah that is the order by Clause you can order your rows by some column you specify in ascending or descending order but yeah that is the order by clause in MySQL
ALht4W2QxqY,MySQL: AUTO_INCREMENT is awesome,2022-10-25T12:56:17Z,hey everybody in today's topic I'm going to explain the auto increment attribute in MySQL the auto increment attribute can be applied to a column that is set as a key whenever we insert a new row our primary key can be populated automatically then each subsequent row is auto incremented I'm going to recreate this table transactions but first I need to drop it drop table transactions then we will recreate this table but apply that auto increment feature create table transactions there were two columns a transaction ID the data type was int and an amount the data type was decimal five digits Precision of two the auto increment feature can only be applied to a column that is set as a key our transaction ID will set to be the primary key to apply the auto increment feature add the keyword Auto increment Now by default the primary key is going to be set to 1. so after creating this table I will select all from transactions okay we have successfully created our table then I will insert some values insert into transactions R values so we don't need to explicitly insert a transaction ID that'll be done for us automatically but we still need an amount I will insert 4.99 for the first amount since we're not inserting all of the values into a row explicitly we would need to specify what column this value is for that is for the amount okay let us execute this and take a look yeah so the transaction ID was set to one even though we did not manually insert that value let's insert the next amount so we have 289 yep transaction ID 2 is 289 3 38 transaction ID3 4.99 transaction ID of four we could set our primary key to begin at a different value to do that we would type alter table the name of the table Auto increment let's begin at 1000 instead of one then I'm going to go ahead and drop all the rows we'll start fresh delete from transactions select all from transactions okay then let's insert those rows again and see what happens insert into transactions R values 4.99 was the first amount this value is for our amount column now this transaction ID it begins at one thousand then it should Auto increment the next value was 289 our next transaction ID is 1001 338 1002 then 4.99 1003 all right everybody that is the auto increment feature it's a keyword that can be applied to a column that is set as a key whenever we insert a new row our key will be incremented by one for each row that we insert but yeah that is auto increment in MySQL
KWgYha0clzw,Learn Python for loops in 5 minutes! 🔁,2022-10-23T17:33:10Z,hey everybody in this topic I need to explain for Loops a for Loop will execute a block of code a fixed number of times you can iterate over a range a string a sequence anything that is considered iterable I'll have more examples for you in future topics there is a lot of overlap where you could use either a while loop or a for Loop but for Loops tend to be better in situations where you have to do something only a fixed number of times here's an example suppose we need to count to ten if we were to use a for Loop we could write something like this we would type four then we would need some sort of counter typically you see people write X 4 x in then we will use the range function what number would we like to start at I would like to start at one then count to ten but the second number is exclusive so really we're going to write 11 if we want to count to 10. so then colon then hit enter whatever code you would like to repeat a certain number of times you will list underneath the for Loop and make sure the code is indented too I will print whatever our counter X is when I run this code we will begin at 1 then stop once we reach 11. so yeah there we are we have been going at one and we have counted all the way to ten so that's the basic Syntax for a for Loop four some counter really you can name this anything sometimes you'll see people name this as counter and that would work too but let's stick with x in some range where would we like to begin where do we stop okay now let's count backwards let's start at 10 then count down to zero when we escape the for Loop let's print Happy New Year when we print Happy New Year we are outside of the for Loop to count backwards you can enclose your range function within the Reversed function reversed so we begin at 10 count down to one then print happy New Year in this case two count backwards you would enclose the range function within the Reversed function there is an additional parameter too you could add that is the step if you would like to count by twos you would add comma two so I'm going to get rid of Happy New Year let's print the numbers 1 through 10 but we will count by twos and this does begin at one though so one three five seven nine if you were to change the step to three you would count by threes beginning at one four seven ten so the range function isn't the only thing you can iterate over you can iterate over a string let's say we have a credit card number credit card equals I'll make up some credit card number with dashes that is good enough for X in credit card print x x will hold our current position at first it'll be one then two three four dash so on and so forth so here's our credit card number one two three four dash five six seven eight I think you get the idea so you can iterate over a string with the for loop as well we'll have a few projects involving that there are two useful keywords as well these aren't exclusive to for Loops you can use these within while Loops as well they are continue and break suppose we are going to count to 20. 4X in range we will begin at 1 stop at 21. I think this is kind of a dumb example but it gets the point across 13 is considered an unlucky number right what if our counter reaches 13 I would like to skip over it well we can do that with the continue keyword if x is equal to 13 we will continue and skip over that iteration else we will print whatever our counter is so let's take a look yeah we have the numbers 1 through 20 but we have skipped the number 13. to skip over an iteration you can use the continue keyword whereas the break keyword we will break out of this Loop entirely if x is equal to 13 then break so yeah we have only counted to 12. once we reach 13 we have escaped the loop so yeah everybody those are for Loops you can execute a block of code a fixed number of times you can iterate over a range a string a sequence anything that is considered iterable there is a lot of overlap where you could use either a while loop or a for Loop while Loops tend to be better if you need to execute something possibly infinite amount of times such as when you're accepting user input for example but yeah everybody those are for Loops in Python
EeG2boJCXbc,MySQL: CHECK constraint is easy,2022-10-20T14:31:20Z,hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the check constraint the check constraint is used to limit what values can be placed in a column for example I live in the United States depending on which state you live in there is a minimum hourly wage that employers have to pay in this example let's set an hourly pay to our employees table every employee needs to be paid at least the minimum wage in that region and we can do that with the check constraint we have our table of employees if I were to recreate this table it would look like this I think that was pretty close to add a check to a column at the end of our table this is what we would write check then within parenthesis what sort of condition do we want let's check to see if our hourly pay column is greater than or equal to maybe $10 per hour that will be the minimum wage in this region this would work if we were to create this table however it's typically a good idea to give your check a name just in case you need to drop it later you can easily identify it so precede check with constraint then a constraint name what about chk meaning check underscore hourly pay this check will be known as check hourly pay so we can identify it then we can drop it or make any changes to it if we need to I do already have an employees table so I'm not going to execute this statement but to add a check constraint to a table you would just add a row like this to the bottom if you instead need to add a check constraint to a table that already exists this would be the syntax alter table the name of the table add constraint then we need a unique name for this constraint check hourly pay that's fine then the check within parentheses hourly pay is greater than or equal to 10 $10 per hour okay let's run this yeah that appears to have worked I'm going to select all from employees let's take a look at our table then we will attempt to add a new employee insert into employees values we need an employee ID first name last name hourly pay then a higher date employee ID will be six first name Sheldon Plankton for hourly pay let's attempt to pay Plankton maybe $5 per hour then a higher date 2020 3- 01-07 let's see if that check constraint kicks in we're paying Plankton under $10 per hour yeah it doesn't appear that we can do so check constraint check hourly pay is violated now let's pay Plankton $10 per hour yeah that worked just fine if you need to delete a check you would type alter table the name of the table drop check than the name that you gave that check in my case it was check hourly pay and that check has been dropped yeah everybody that is the check constraint it's used to limit what values can be placed in a column it's another useful method for checking input and that is the check constraint in MySQL
Of_-2pBeL0g,MySQL: UNIQUE constraint,2022-10-18T14:00:42Z,hey everybody I have a quick video on the unique constraint the unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are all different that's basically it we can add this constraint when we create a table or after let's create a new table create table let's create a table of products what products do we offer we'll list the columns let's add a product ID the data type will be int product name the data type will be varchar maybe 25 characters then a price price the data type will be decimal our price will have a Max size of four digits and a Precision of two decimal places to add the unique constraint select a column after the data type add the keyword unique and that's all you have to do with this keyword unique we can't insert any product names that are the same they all have to be well unique let's create this table let's say that you forget the unique keyword then you create the table what you could do instead is type alter table the name of the table products which we just created add constraint unique the name of the column within parentheses product name if you forget to add a unique constraint to a column after you already create the table this is what you can write uh however when I run this I do have a warning I already have a unique constraint on that column but yeah that's how you would add a unique constraint to a column in a table you have already created let's select our table select all from products we have a product ID column product name and a price let's insert all of our values insert into the name of our table which is products values will insert maybe four rows we'll need a product ID name then a price for a product name we have a hamburger and the product ID I'm just making up a number is 100. the name is hamburger the price will be 3.99 Fry's will be our next item then we have prize the price will be 189. 102 will be soda the price is one dollar even 103 will be ice cream the price will be 149. Let's test the unique constraint that we have added to the product name column suppose that I forget that I have fries on the menu already and I will add another row 104 Fry's 189 actually let me change the price to maybe something different like 175. here's what happens when I attempt to add two values that are the same duplicate entry fries for Key Products dot product name MySQL is telling us that we have a duplicate under the product name column we have fries twice since we added the unique constraint all values in this column must be different if I were to remove the last column where we have that duplicate well then this would run just fine now let's select everything from products yeah there we go here are the products we have a hamburger fries soda and ice cream all on the menu so yeah that's the unique constraint you can add that constraint when you create a table or after whatever column has that unique constraint all the values need to be different so yeah that's the unique constraint in MySQL
kUDznItqKbI,MySQL: How to SELECT data from a TABLE,2022-10-12T12:53:07Z,hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can select data from a table to query all of the data from a table we would type select asterisk meaning all from the name of the table in my case we have table employees this statement select all from employees will give me all columns and all rows but sometimes you may not want all of the data here's a scenario your boss gives you a task of retrieving the full name of every employee well we don't need employee ID hourly pay or hire date for that right we just need a list of the first and last names of our employees table in place of the asterisk meaning all we can select specific columns such as first name and last name we have all of the first and last names from our employees table you can change up the order of the columns too this time I would like last name then first name with our query this returned all of the last and first names of all the employees point being you can select specific columns depending on what you're looking for or everything with the asterisk there is a clause known as the wear Clause if we're looking for something specific let's add where then what are we looking for exactly we can write some criteria let's select all from employees where employee ID equals 1 then end your statement with a semicolon this will give us a specific employee the employee that has an ID of one if I set employee ID to be two that would give us Squidward three would be SpongeBob four Patrick I think you get the idea here's an exercise let's find all the data from employees where the first name equals SpongeBob where first name equals SpongeBob this query will return employee ID 3 the first name last name hourly pay and higher date here's another example let's find all employees that have an hourly pay greater than or equal to 15 our criteria will be where hourly pay is greater than we'll use the greater than operator or equal to 15 this returns three employees Mr Krabs Squidward and Sandy all three of them have an hourly pay of $15 per hour or greater it is possible your query can return multiple results let's find anybody that has a higher date less than or equal to perhaps the year 2023 January 3rd this query returns two results Eugene Krabs and Squidward Tentacles they both match this criteria and in this case we use the less than or equals to operator another operator you should know about is the not comparison operator it's an exclamation point and an equal sign we will check if something is not equal let's find where employee ID does not equal one who are all the employees that have an ID not equal to one that gives us Squidward SpongeBob Patrick Sandy and Plankton on the other hand if I set this to one that would give us Mr Krabs that is the not comparison operator if you need to check if something is not equal in this next example let's pretend that we're human resources we need to find any employees that do not have a higher date and then begin the paperwork for them currently Plankton's our pay and higher date are both set to null null meaning no value in place of saying you know higher date equals null in place of using the equal sign we would type is select all from employees where higher date is null that would return Sheldon Plankton because his higher date is null not equals null that doesn't work it would be is null you could even say is not null that would return every employee that does have a higher date all right everybody so that is how to query data from a table select whatever you're looking for it can be everything or specific columns from a table of you're choosing where the results equal some criteria that you set it really depends on what you're looking for and that is how to query data from a table
nMCOB8KElwo,User input in Python is easy + exercises ⌨️,2022-10-07T13:31:53Z,hey everybody in this topic I'm going to show you how we can accept some user input then I have a few exercises for us to work on we'll work on Mad Libs a program to calculate the area of a square and a shopping cart program how do we accept user input well we do so within our console window down here the same that we use for output to accept some user input we can use the input function within the set of parentheses we can type a prompt to be displayed to the console window let's ask for somebody's name enter your name when I run this program our program is paused in the console window until we type in something and hit enter I'll enter my name you can enter in your own name hit enter but nothing appears to happen we've accepted user input but we should probably store the input somewhere how about inside of a variable I'll assign my variable name equal to the input that we receive our input will be stored within this variable and then we can use it for something so let's print whatever our name is within a message I'll use an F string hello our variable name let's try this again enter your name I'll type in my first name hit enter hello Pro let's ask for somebody's age this time we'll create variable age set this equal to input then we'll need a prompt enter your age then we will print using an F string you are our variable age years old and to your name I'll type in my first name and your age I'll make up an age hello bro you are 21 years old when we accept user input the input is always of the string data type what if I were to increase my variable age by one H equals h plus one this is what would happen bro 21 uh we have a type error can only concatenate strings not integers two strings if I accept user input and I need to use it for any sort of math I would want to type cast that input as either an integer or a float based on the previous lesson on typecasting we could write age equals I'll type cast my age which is a string into an integer so type in your first name and age and that appears to work uh however I like to do this involving one line of code in place of adding an additional line where we're typecasting I'll take the user input and place this function within a Typecast I'll type int then surround the input function with the set of parentheses then that only takes one line of code So Pro 21 there we go that also works if we were to type cast our input as a float well then my input would be a floating Point number it has that decimal portion so when you accept user input it's always of the string data type if you're going to use your input with any sort of math you'll probably want to Typecast it as either a float or an integer and that's how to accept user input let's go over a few exercises the first we'll create a Mad Libs game all right everybody for our first practice program we're going to create a Mad Libs game Mad Libs is where you have a story but the user gets to submit nouns verbs and adjectives within your story so let's think of a story feel free to come up with your own I'll use fstrings today I went to a we'll insert an adjective here an adjective is a quality of a thing Zoo so what kind of zoo an expensive Zoo a cheap Zoo a dirty Zoo a clean Zoo that's an adjective it's a quality of a noun our second line let's say is in an exhibit I saw then a noun a noun is a person Placer thing our noun was then an adjective and a verb a verb is an action I would like two different adjectives let's rename this first adjective as adjective one the second adjective will be adjective two after our verb I'll add ing that means that this verb is current tense it's currently happening print this will be an upstring I was then let's add a third adjective adjective three we just need to declare and assign these variables we have adjective one our noun adjective two our verb then adjective three we'll accept user input input will ask the user to enter an adjective let's copy this line add that to adjective two and adjective three for noun will input enter a noun our verb will be enter a verb all right we're ready to run our Mad Libs game an adjective describes a quality of a person place or thing like Fast slow uh what about suspicious or I'll just say sus for short enter a noun mark Zuckerberg a noun is a person Placer thing enter an adjective berserk enter a verb a verb is an action how about Screech enter an adjective amazed all right here's our story today I went to a sus zoo in an exhibit I saw Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg was berserk and screeching I was amazed all right that is our first exercise I'd like to see what you wrote post your results in the comment section down below because I would like to read it all right let's move on to the second exercise for this next exercise we will calculate the area of a rectangle we'll need two variables length and width we'll take length equal to accept some user input enter the length of a rectangle then we'll need the width width enter the width of a rectangle we will take our area variable set this equal to length times width then let's display whatever the area is the area is colon space I'll insert our area variable depending on the unit of measurement you can set this two inches centimeters or something else I'll just say centimeters I believe that centimeters squared technically okay let's try it the length will be 9 the width is 15. we have a problem type error can't multiply sequence by non-integers of type string what we're missing here is we need to Typecast our user input as either a floating Point number or an integer we're using these variables in arithmetic equations so let's Typecast our length and our width as a floating Point number foreign enter the length of a rectangle 9 15 . the area is 135 centimeters squared hey If This Were a 3D rectangle we could add height equals I'm going to copy all this enter the height of a rectangle volume equals length times width times height the volume is our volume centimeters cubed technically nine fifteen seven I'm just making up numbers here the volume is 945.0 centimeters cubed all right so that is the second exercise we have calculated well I guess both the area of a rectangle and the volume of a three-dimensional rectangle okay we have one more exercise a shopping cart program we have three variables item a price of the item then a quantity we'll ask the user what item they're buying input what item would you like to buy then a price input what is the price then a quantity input how many would you like if we're working with a string we don't need to do any type casting a price with a price that could include a decibel we should type cast our input as a floating Point number I'll surround our input with a type cast to a float and with a quantity those are typically integers they're whole numbers I'll type cast our input as an integer so surround our input with an intercast then we can do some calculations total equals our price multiplied by our quantity then we'll display a message to the user print we'll use an F string you have bought our quantity variable times whatever the item is that we're trying to buy then I'll add slash S because they might buy more than one item then we'll display the total your total is colon space then our total I should probably precede the total with some currency maybe a dollar sign okay let's run this program what item would you like to buy I would like to buy a pizza what is the price maybe a pizza is 4.99 how many would you like to buy I would like to buy nine pizzas all right here's the total 44.91 we can truncate everything up to two decimal places and here's how there is a built-in round function I'm going to surround our total within a round function then after our variable I'll add comma then the amount of decimal places to round two let's try this again what item would you like to buy a pizza the price is 4.99 how many would you like to buy I'd like nine pizzas your total is 44.91 like I said to truncate everything after two decimal places you could use the built-in round function then set the amount of decimal places you would like to round to alright everybody that is the third exercise we have made a small shopping cart program

-TkoO8Z07hI,C++ Full Course for free ⚡️,2022-06-28T23:47:32Z,"hey guys in this video you're going to write your first C++ program so sit back relax and well enjoy the show hey if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the YouTube algorithm I'm going to tell you why you need to learn C++ C++ is a fast language like really fast it's commonly used in advanced Graphics applications a few examples would include a doobe applications video editing software anything that's Graphics intensive C++ is considered a middle level language therefore it's commonly used with embedded systems and most importantly it's commonly used with creating video games I like video games like a lot compared to other programming languages you could say that C++ is a middle level language programming languages tend to be on a spectrum the higher level of programming language is the more it resembles human language languages that are closer to being lower level resemble Hardware instructions higher level languages such as python Java and CP are very easy to write with and to understand but they tend to be slower C++ and C they take a little more effort to write but they're very fast they have the benefit of working closely with machine Hardware while still somewhat resembling human language just a fair warning there is a learning curve with C++ but if you can learn it it's worth it there's two things you'll need to get started one is a text editor a few options include but are not limited to would be vs code code blocks or even notepad VSS code and code blocks are also considered Ides integrated development environments they are a text editor as well as a workshop that contain a lot of useful developer Tools in this video I'm going to show you how to download VSS code but feel free to use any text editor that you're comfortable with secondly we'll need a compiler a compiler ER is a piece of software that will parse source code to machine instructions and that's really it if you're using Windows or Linux you'll probably want to go with GCC if you're running Mac you'll probably go with cang okay cang has a really cool logo it's blue eyes white dragon so let's get started well all right then everybody now we are going to download VSS code that text editor I was talking about head to this URL code dovisual studio.com then select the correct download for your operating system I'm running Windows I'll select windows then I will open this read the agreement yes I actually did read it that fast I accept the agreement next next next I'll create a desktop icon why not next and install we might as well launch it finish in VSS code there's two extensions I would recommend go to the left toolbar under underneath extensions we will look up c/c++ and we would like to download this extension uh let's pretend that this wasn't already installed so I'm going to install it then the next extension I recommend is code Runner here it is then just click this blue button to install it okay let's close out of this we're going to create a new folder to hold our C++ projects go to the left tool bar explore open folder I'll create a new folder on my desktop new folder I'll name this C++ projects that sounds good to me then select folder within this folder we'll create a new file I'll name this hello world. CPP make sure to get that CPP extension at the end that means it's a C++ file okay we now have a C++ file to work with now we just need to download that compiler that parses source code to machine instructions there's a great set of instructions at this URL code dovisual studio.com slocs let's head to C++ there's different installation instructions depending on your operating system you'll be downloading GCC on Linux if you're running Linux GCC on Windows for Windows and clling for Mac OS downloading a compiler for Linux and Mac is actually really easy I can cover that in like 30 seconds Windows is a little more complicated but let's begin with Linux so all you're going to do is open up terminal and enter the following command GCC SLV that will check to see if it's currently installed if it's not you enter this command in then you install the gnu compiler tools by typing in this Command right here and that's all you need to do with Linux if you're on Mac you'll download clang open Terminal type in this command if clang isn't installed all you type is this command and that's it so pretty easy right if you're using the Windows operating system there's way more steps so let's head to step three we'll need to install mgww 64 you can click this link to the installer this is an executable I'll open this when it's done click next next next wait for it we might as well run this then finish now we will follow the installation instructions on this website under step five we will type Pacman Das capitals Yu enter type y then enter to proceed with the installation type y then enter again to confirm to proceed now we'll need to find this program from the start menu M cis2 then type this command pack man- Su enter type y then enter to proceed with the installation now we'll need to enter this command in there's a lot to type here Pacman ds-- needed base Dash Dev L min gw- w64 DX 86 uncore 64- tool chain then enter then just hit enter proceed with the installation type yes type why enter again then give it a moment then we can close out of this window we'll have to find the bin folder of MW W it's likely going to be within your C drive go to m64 MW 64 bin then copy this address we'll need to add that path to the windows path environment variable to do so search settings settings we'll search edit environment variables go to path edit let's pretend that this wasn't here I'm going to go to new paste that address okay okay close out of this window just to be sure that our compiler is working and available let's open up command prompt command prompt then type in this command G Plus+ D- version enter yeah it looks like it's good to go we have now successfully installed our compiler all right everybody let's write our first C++ program at the top of our C++ file we are going to type include within angle brackets IO stream iostream is a header file that contains functions for basic input put and output operations by writing include iio stream we're including that header file then we have access to a whole bunch of useful input and output operations now we'll need a main function the main function is where the program begins we'll type int main parenthesis curly braces We Begin the program by invoking the main function and read any code within the main function starting at the top and working our way down at the end of our main function we'll want return zero then add a semicolon if we reach return zero that means there were no problems in this program however if one is returned that means there was a problem there was an issue so Place return zero at the end of your main function what we'll do in this lesson is write some basic output to write some output you'll type STD contrary to what you might believe in this case it doesn't mean sexually transmitted diseases it means standard follow STD with two colons then type c out c means character Out means output Al together this means standard character output we're going to display some characters as output then follow C out with two left angle brackets these characters mean output it's also known as the left shift operator when used with numbers what characters would we like to display as output within quotation marks let's write something what's a food you like I like pizza I'll type that then follow this statement with a semicolon at the end of statements we add a semicolon that lets the compiler know that this statement is done it's sort of like the period at the end of a sentence that's when you know the sentence is complete so I'm going to save this I'll hold contrl s or you can go to file save then click this button to run it and there's my output I like pizza on the next line I'll type STD two colons C out two left angle brackets for output I'll write a second line it's really good then I'll run this again you can press this icon to clear your output uhoh we have a problem I like pizza it's really good all of this text is on one line what if you need the next line of text to be on well the next line when you need to move your cursor down to the next line you can follow some string of text with left angle brackets for output STD colon colon e n DL that means end line and I'll do the same for my second line I'm going to save clear my output run this again yeah there we go I like pizza it's really good each line of text is on a different line another option for a new line that's better performance-wise is to add a new line character within single quotes type back sln and let's replace that here as well so I'm going to save clear my output run this again I like pizza it's really good adding a new line character does the same thing and it's better performance-wise however the benefit of using end line is that end line will flush the output buffer really you can use either one but I thought that might be a nice trick to show you now you can write a comment a comment is ignored by the compiler to write a comment you use two forward slashes this is a comment comments are used for yourself for notes or for notes for another developer so if I were to run this again this comment is ignored it's not used as output or anything like that if you need a multi-line comment you type slash asterisk wherever you need your comment to end you'll Place asterisk forward slash again this is a multi-line comment and you can see that all of this is ignored as well so comments are used as notes for yourself or for other developers yeah that's a quick introduction to getting started with C++ I'll post this code in the comment section down below if you would like a copy hey if you enjoyed this video please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey guys I'm going to explain what variables are a variable you probably remember from middle school math class a variable is a representation of some number or value there are two steps to creating and using a variable declaration and assignment we'll begin with declaration to declare a variable we need to list the data type of what we're storing exactly in programming you can store more than just numbers you can store characters even whole sentences Etc let's work with whole numbers to store a whole number we will type int for integer then we need a unique identifier for this variable for now let's just say x we're used to working with like X and Y in math class right we will end the statement with a semicolon this step is declaration now to assign a variable you take the variable's name that unique identifier then we will set this equal to some number since we declared this variable as an INT it will store an integer maybe like five now this variable behaves as if it was the value that it contains it will behave as if it was the number five then to display a variable we can use standard output STD C out we will display X and let's see what we have there's our value five this first step is declaration the second step is assignment the nice thing about doing this in two steps is that you can later assign your variable a value if you know what value you would like to give your variable right away you can do that at the beginning of your program you could combine both of those steps int xal 5 and that would do the same thing in cases where you don't know what value you would like to give a variable you could assign it later such as when you accept user input you don't know what the user is going to type so let's create another int y = 6 then let's display whatever Y is I'll add a new line let's copy this paste it okay X is 5 Y is 6 we could even do something like this let's say int sum = x + y then we'll display whatever our sum variable is see out sum the sum of x + y is 11 now there's different data types depending on what you need to store than a variable exactly the int data type stores a whole integer let's think of a few examples of whole integers what about an age that's typically a whole number int age equals 21 let's think of two more examples what about a year in year equals 2023 how about days int days equals 7 the int data type can only store a whole number number with days what if we assign this a value of 7.5 let me show you what happens all right I will display days all right that decimal portion is truncated when I display days and we attempt to assign 7.5 well this variable can't store that decimal so it's truncated if you need a number that includes a decimal portion there 's a different data type for that and that is a double this is a number including decimal a few examples of a double would be maybe a price there's dollars and cents double price equals $10.99 what about a GPA a grade point average that includes a decimal double GPA equals 2.5 uh then maybe a temperature double temperature equals 25.1 I guess this could be an either Celsius or Fahrenheit then let's display maybe price price yeah and that decimal portion is not truncated much like like what you see with whole integers if you need a number that includes a decimal portion use a double now we have the Char data type that stores A Single Character type Char maybe we're working with student grades I'll name this variable grade equals then to store a single character you use single quotes this student has an a two more examples what about an initial singular not initials Char initial uh what about B so I'm going to display initial initial okay we have our Single Character of B now check this out what if I attempt to store more than one character I'll add C we have a warning we have an overflow in conversion from int to char so what's displayed is the last character just see so chars can only store A Single Character here's one more example of a Char data type what if we're working with currency what type of currency will we work with Char currency equals maybe a dollar sign if we're working with a different type of currency we could change this to a different symbol yeah that's the Char data type it stores A Single Character next on our list is is Boolean Boolean a variable that's Boolean has only two states true or false to create a Boolean variable you type bull then a variable name so these are applicable to anything that has two states what if somebody is a student they're either a student or not a student bu student equals true if they're not enrolled in classes or they graduated you could set to be false think of a light switch the light switch can either be on or off you could say a light switch is Boolean there's only two states true or false how about bu power is something powered on or not power equals true if it's turned off that could be false maybe we have a store and we need to Mark if something is for sale or not like is it available bu for sale equals true if an item in our or isn't for sale like it's not available we could set this to be false so that's the idea behind Boolean values it has two states true or false the last data type I'll cover is strings a string is technically an object that represents a sequence of text think of it as the Char data type but we can store more than one character even whole sentences like a name or an address strings are provided from the standard namespace to declare a string we would type standard string then a variable name what about just name like we're storing a user's name place your text within a set of double quotes then why don't you type your first name then we will store that within this variable name then to test it let's display it standard output we will display name and there is your first name let's create a couple more examples what about about a day of the week standard string day then pick a day I like Friday what about food standard string food I like pizza I'll store this series of text as a string then maybe an address standard string address equals make up some address 1 2 3 fake Street basically speaking a string is a type of object that represents a sequence of text such as a name a day an address Etc now I'm going to show you how we can display a variable along with some text I would like to display hello then whatever your name is I will type what is known as a string literal we're literally printing a string hello follow this string of text with a variable my variable name is good then let's display it hello then whatever your first name is but you do have to pay attention to spacing after my word hello I'm going to add a space there hello bro then let's display our age so I'm going to add a new line character standard output we will display you are age years old there hello bro you are 21 years old uh make sure to pay attention to the spacing as well because it's easy to mess that up all right so those are variables we covered a few of the basic data types but there's more advanced data types once we gain a little bit more experience with this that I'll cover we have integers which store a whole number doubles which are numbers that include a decimal portion chars are single characters booleans are either true or false then strings represent a sequence of text an important note with strings is that you can include numbers but they're treated differently so yeah those are variables in C++ your assignment is to in the comment section post a integer variable a double a character Boolean and a string think of some examples preferably some examples that I may have not covered already that would be good practice well yeah and that's an introduction to variables in C++ all right welcome back everybody in this video we're going to discuss the const keyword the const keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant it tells the compiler to prevent anything from modifying it so that it's effectively readon here's an example let's create a program to calculate the circumference of a circle we'll first Define the variables that we'll need we have double Pi Pi = 3.14159 then we have Double Radius pick some radius I'll pick 10 then double circumference equals and here's the formula to calculate the circumference of a circle it's 2 * pi times radius then we will display our circumference standard output we will display circumference then I'll add maybe centimet our circumference is 62.83 cm any variable we do not want to be able to be changed at all we can turn into a constant let's say that somebody goes into our program and changes pi to a different number like 42069 well then this is going to change the result of our program we may have not realized that somebody changed the value of pi to 42069 so any variable you do not want changed you can prefix this keyword const const double Pi now a common naming convention for constants is to make all of the letters uppercase so let's change PI from lowercase to all uppercase and we'll need to make that change here as well now let's try and change pi to 42069 again then see what happens okay we have an error assignment of readon variable Pi so by including constants it adds some data security we can't normally change any value that's a constant a couple other examples of variables that you could turn into constants could be maybe the speed of light maybe you have a physics calculator so const in light speed the speed of light in meters per second is 299 792 458 let's think of one more example perhaps you're working with screen resolutions we have const int width of 1920 then const in height of 1080 these may be a few examples uh variables you do not want to be changed or altered at all you only want them to be readon yeah that's a const everybody it's a keyword that will modify a variable or some value so that it's readon and can't be changed you should use constants as often as possible only if you know that a variable is not going to be changed at all your assignment is to think of a constant and post in the comment section hey if you're enjoying the series please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey everyone I have a quick video on namespaces a namespace provides a solution for preventing name conflicts especially in larger projects each entity needs a unique name a name space allows for identically named entities as long as the name spaces are different now what the heck does that mean suppose we have variable x x equal 0 each variable needs a unique name I couldn't create a second variable named X and give this a different value if I were to compile and run this program we would run into an error red Declaration of int X so each entity needs unique name but if we use namespaces then two or more entities can share the same name to create a namespace let's do so outside of the main function I will type namespace then some name for the namespace let's say first then a set of parentheses I could create a different version of X I'll give this a different value like one well this would run and compile just fine you can have different versions of the same variable as long as they're within a different namespace just for fun let's create a second namespace namespace second x = 2 this is also valid so just to demate a few things I'm going to display what x is if I don't explicitly State what namespace we're using we will use the local version of an entity if I display x x would be zero if I would like the version of X that is found within the first namespace I would take that entity in this case X prefix the namespace let's say first then two colons the two colons is known as the scope resolution oper Ator I'm referring to the version of X that is found within the first namespace and that version of X has a value of one if I need the value of x found within the second namespace I would precede that entity with the second namespace followed by the scope resolution operator so that version of X is two so entities can have the same name as long as they're within a different name space now one line that you may see is use using namespace then the name of a namespace let's say first if we have some entity without a prefix of the namespace it's assumed that we're using the entity found within that particular namespace so if I was to display X while we're using namespace first X would be one and I don't need to add that prefix but if I need X found within the second namespace I would still need to prefix it with second X is 2 if I changed using namespace to Second it's implied we're using the second namespace and I don't need that prefix two but I still would if I need X from the first name space one now there's this evil line called using namespace STD for standard now the reason that people include this line is to save a little bit of typing if we're using namespace STD we don't need to include that prefix when we declare strings or we display output with C out just for example like this would still compile and run however the standard namespace has hundreds of different entities let me show you standard there's a high likelihood of a naming Conflict for example we have an entity named data one alternative is that we could say using standard output that will cut down on some some of the repetitions or using standard string it's a safer alternative to using namespace standard in the future I'm not going to be using namespace standard because I would like to steer people away from that but just in case you see that line you know what it's there for so in conclusion a namespace provides a solution for preventing name conflicts each entity needs a unique name and namespace allows for identically named entities as long as the namespaces are different so those are namespaces hey if you're enjoying this series let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey everyone in this topic I'm going to explain type defs and type aliases now type def is a reserved keyword used to create an additional name for another data type kind of like a nickname it's a new identifier for an existing type one of the reasons that people use type def is that it helps with readability and reduces typos here's an example in this example I'll need to include this header file include Vector suppose we have this very long data type and I would like to give it a nickname an alias I would type the keyword type def then list the original data type so we're used to Strings ins doubles well here's a really complicated one one and of course I don't expect anybody to know this at this level yet standard Vector standard pair standard string int so this is one really long data type this could be a data type for a pair list but I don't want to have to type all of this so what I could do is give this data type an alias using this type Dev keyword after the original data type I'll come up with a new name a new identifier let's say pair list that's a lot easier to write than all of this for the data type a common convention when using the type def keyword the new identifier usually ends with underscore t for type now suppose I declare a variable of this data type standard Vector standard pair standard string int let's say the name is pair list in place of using the original data type we can use the new identifier pair listor T so that's one of the main benefits of using the type def keyword we can give a new identifier to an existing data type it helps with code readability and helps reduce typos this data type is way beyond our level of understanding right now let's try some simple examples I'll turn this line into a comment then get rid of that let's create a type def for standard strings type def then we list the original data type standard string in place of using standard string as the data type I'll create a new identifier for this data type as maybe just text textor T if I need to create a string I could use this new identifier in place of saying standard string then maybe first name I can replace the data type with the new identifier if I choose to text T and I'll set my first name equal to whatever my first name is feel free to set it to your own first name and this variable behaves exactly like a string so let's display it standard output first name and then we should have our first name yeah there we are okay now let's try this with an integer type da we list the old data type int let's create an identifier for INT as number that's more descriptive underscore T although it's more to write technically in place of using the int data type I could use number T and this is technically an integer uh let's say age then make up some age standard output I will display my age then I will add a new line yep we have our first name and our age now type def has largely been replaced with the using keyword that's because the using keyword works better with templates which is a topic for another video so in place of using type def I recommend using the using keyword so I'm going to turn these lines into comments now if we were to use the using keyword we would type using then the new data type so let's say text T equals the old data type standard string then let's do that with number using the new identifier number T equals int and that would work the same we have our first name and our age the using keyword is more popular than typed def nowadays just because it's more suit for templates and like I said that's a topic for another video all right everybody that is the typ def keyword and type aliases typed def along with the using keyword they're used to create an additional name an alias or nickname for another data type it's a new identifier for an existing data type it helps with readability and it reduces typos however you should really only be using the typ def and using keywords when there is a clear benefit so yeah that is typ defs and type aliases your assignment is to post a type def in the comment section down below and well yeah those are type defs and type aliases in C++ all right everybody welcome we are going to discuss arithmetic operators arithmetic operators return the result of a specific arithmetic operation such as addition subtraction multiplication and division let's say we have 20 students int students equals 20 if a new student joins our class we would like to add one student well if we're working with the variable we could say students equals whatever students is+ one then we could display this standard output I will display students the current number of students that we have are 21 there is a shorthand way of writing this too in place of saying students equals students + 1 we could shorten this to students plus equals 1 that would would do the same thing 21 if we need to add two students this would be students equals students plus two or students plus equals 2 then we have 22 students if you need to add one to a variable you could also use the increment operator this is another option and the preferred way if you only need to add one you would say students Plus+ we now have 21 students you tend to to see this in a lot of Loops which we'll cover later okay now we have subtraction students equals students - one there are now 19 students we could shorten this to students minus equals 1 there are 19 students if you need to subtract two we could say either students equals students minus 2 or students minus equals 2 that would do the same thing there there are 18 students another option is the decrement operator if you need to decrement a variable by one you would say students minus minus this only subtracts one from a variable there are 19 students so that subtraction to use multiplication you use an asterisk I'm going to double the amount of students that we have students equals students * 2 there are 40 students or we can shorten this to students times equals 2 and again there are 40 students for division you use a forward slash I'm going to divide our class in half students equals students divided two there are 10 students the shorthand way is students / equals 2 there are 10 students now check this out we have 20 students what if I divide students by three we're working with an in variable so this variable can't hold any decimal portion 20 / 3 that is 6 so any decimal portion is lost it's truncated but if we change students to be a double well then that decimal portion is retained 6.66 repeating students if you need the remainder of any division you can use the modulus operator let's create a new variable int remainder equals students modulus 2 we'll divide our group of 20 students into groups of two then I'll display the remainder okay 20 divides by two evenly so there's no remainder but what if we divide students by three and get the remainder our class of students is being divided into groups of three for maybe like a project but 20 doesn't divide by three evenly therefore our remainder is two there will be six group groups of three students and one group of two students Now using the modulus operator is a great way to find out if a number is even or odd take some value or variable you would like to check modulus 2 if that number divides by two evenly where the remainder is zero well it's even if the remainder is one well then it's an odd number 21 doesn't divide by two evenly so that is the modulus operator it gives you the remainder of any division these arithmetic operators have an order of Precedence we resolve any arithmetic op operations that are first within parentheses then multiplication and division then lastly addition and subtraction perhaps we have this formula students equals 6 - 5 + 4 * 3 / 2 so what do we solve first in this equation we would check any parentheses first which there aren't any of then we resolve any multiplication and division so let's go through this so we have some multiplication here we would resolve 4 * 3 first that is 12 then we have some division 12 / 2 is 6 then any addition and subtraction 6 - 5 is 1 1 + 6 is seven and let's check to see if that's right so students should be seven yep students is seven now you can force operator precedence by surrounding some part of your equation with parentheses I'll surround this part of the equation with the set of parentheses the new result is -7 well yeah everybody those are some basic arithmetic operators they return the result of a specific arithmetic operation hey if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and pin it to the top and well yeah those are some basic arithmetic operators in C++ hey what's going on everybody in this video I'm going to explain very basic type conversion type conversion is the conversion of a value of one data type to another two ways in which we can do this are implicit and explicit implicit is done automatically if done explicitly we proceed a value with the new data type within a set of parentheses you list the new data type put it before a variable or a value let's perform an implicit cast suppose we have variable int X I will assign X the value 3.14 integers can only hold a whole number if I were to display X standard I'll put X well the value is three we truncated the decimal portion and implicitly converted this number into an integer what if x was of the double data type double x = 3.14 well then we would retain that decimal portion what would happen if I cast 3.14 as an integer then assigned it to a variable before the value add a set of parentheses then the new data type I will convert 3.14 to an integer then store it within this double x x now equals 3 it's a whole integer that is one example of implicit and explicit type conversion here's a few other examples I have character x equals some number like 100 if I were to display what x was standard output put X well we will implicitly cast this number 100 as a character we'll convert it using the asky table to whatever its equivalent is the number 100 converted to a character is the letter D let's try an explicit cast I will display the number 100 explicitly cast to a character and that value is the letter d as output how is this useful suppose we have an online exam we have to give the user a score how many questions did they get right divided by how many questions were total let's write something like this int correct equals maybe 8 the user has eight questions that are right int questions equals 10 there are 10 total questions I need to calculate the score as a percentage we could say double score equals correct divided questions time 100 then let's display whatever the result is standard output score then I'll add a percent sign to the end 8 / 10 is8 right time 100 that should give us 80% uh we have 0% well that's because we're using integer division questions is of the data type when we're dividing 8 by 10 we're truncating that decimal portion we're getting rid of it then multiplying whatever Remains by 100 I'm going to explicitly cast questions as a double of the double data type and we should retain that decimal portion yeah there we go 80% where you'll use type conversion it really varies but you should be aware that you can do it such as when using integer division so yeah that's type conversion in C++ hey if you're enjoying this series let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right let's get started everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can accept some user input in C++ we're familiar with C out followed by the insertion operator which is two left angle brackets while to accept some input we would type c in for character input followed by the extraction operator which is two right angle brackets here's a demonstration let's ask a user for their name I'll create a string variable standard string the name will be well name then I'll create a prompt which will ask the user what their name is standard output insertion operator what's your name then to accept some user input we would type standard CN for character input extraction operator then where would we like to store the user input let's store it within our variable name at the end of our program let's display what the user's name is standard output insertion operator hello name okay we're going to have one problem though if we're using vs code as our text editor we need to begin using the terminal tab previously we've been using output so I can't actually type in anything to this cuz it's well output if you're using vs code this is what we'll need to do if you're not you can skip the step we're going to go to file preferences settings look up code Runner then we are looking for run in terminal which is right about here check that close this tab let's stop this from running and we'll run it again okay here we go what's your name I'll type in my first name hit enter hello bro or whatever your first name was this time let's ask a user for what their age is I'll store this within a variable named age int age standard output what's your age standard input extraction operator age standard out output insertion operator you are age years old and I think we'll need some new line characters right about here just one okay this should work let's try it what's your name I'll type in my first name hit enter what's your age I'll make up an age I like to think that I'm 21 still hit enter hello bro you are 21 years old so that's how to accept some user input you can use CN for character input uh but there's just one problem though if you type in a string that has spaces well once we hit a space we stop reading that string this time let's ask a user to type in their full name okay type in your first name and your last name hit enter what's your full name bro code what's your age hello bro you are Zer years old if we need to read a stream that could contain spaces there's a function that we can use to help us with that that is the get line function standard get line add a set of parentheses within the parenthesis we will type standard C in then comma our variable name now we should be able to type in a string including any spaces what's your full name type in your own first name and last name hit enter what's your age I'll type in 21 hello bro code you are 21 years old if you need to accept a string that includes any white spaces you're better off using the getline function and if you forget I'll post this in the comments section so you can always take a look at it if you don't remember okay there's just one issue with this though I'm going to move the second question above the first let's take a look to see what happens what's your age 21 what's your full name hello you are 21 years old here's the issue if we accept some user input with C in followed by get line well in our input buffer there's a new line character and we don't pick up that new line character when we reach the get line function it accepts the new line character that's still within the buffer so to prevent that from happening there's one change that we can make to the getline function after CN add this extraction operator standard WS for any Whit spaces this portion will eliminate any new line characters or any white spaces before any user input so let's try this again what's your age I'll type in 21 type in your full name and there we go hello bro code you are 21 years old so yeah everybody that's how to accept some user input basically you can just use CN followed by the extraction operator but if you need a string that could include spaces I recommend using the getline function so yeah that's how to accept some user input in C++ plus if you would like a copy of all this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to accept some user input in C++ hey guys in this video I'm going to show you eight useful math related functions in C++ let's begin by creating three variables double X and I will set this to be three Double Y that will be four then double z we will declare this but not assign it the first useful math related function is the max function which will return the greater of two values or variables I'll assign the result within z z equals standard max parentheses within the parentheses add two values or variables I'll compare X and Y then let's display the result standard output I would like to display whatever Z is the greater number between three and four is well you guessed it four alternatively there's the Min function Z equals standard Min let's compare X then y so the minimum between these two values would be three so that's Max and Min now the rest of these functions are found within the cmath header file at the top of our file let's include C math we have the PO function to raise a base to a given power Z equal PO for power let's raise 2 the^ of 3 Z would be 8 2 the^ of 4 would be 16 that's the power function then we have square root Z = sqrt what's the square otk of 9 well the square < TK of 9 is three then we have absolute value Z equals Abs if you place a negative number within the absolute value function it will give you the positive version of that number how far it is away from zero so -3 the absolute value of -3 would be 3 that is the absolute value function next we have the round function let's change X to 3.14 Z equal round let's round x 3.14 rounded would be three if you need to round up there's a cealing function Z equals Seal Seal means cealing let's round x x rounded up is four alternatively there's the floor function which will always round down let's change X to 3.99 to test it Z equals floor x x rounded down is three so yeah everybody that is a super quick video on a few useful math related functions if you head to this URL C+ plus.com reference cmath there's a lot more useful math functions that you may be interested in but we just covered a few of the basics in the next topic we're going to create a practice program to find the hypo new of a right triangle so yeah those are a few useful math related functions in C++ okay everybody this is going to be a practice project to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle which we can find with this formula C = theare < TK of a^2 + b^2 we'll Begin by declaring our variables double a double B Double C make sure you include cmath as well because we'll be using the power function as well as the square root function at this point we'll accept some user input for sides A and B standard output will create a prompt enter side a standard input a then we'll need side B standard output put enter side B standard input B we can handle this formula step by step we could reassign a equal to power function a to the power of two b equals power function B to the^ of two side C equals the Square t of a + b then at the end we will display whatever side C is standard output side C C okay let's try this enter side a I'll type in three side B will be four side C is five we could shorten this code too we could say the square root of a to the^ of 2 plus b to the^ of two then we no longer need these two lines that's another way of writing it in less lines of code let's try this again this time side a will be four side B will be five side C is 6 .4 so yeah everybody that's a simple practice project just to get us used to accepting user input as well as some math related functions if you would like a copy of this program I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a simple practice project in C++ all right guys we are on if statements with an if statement you do something if a condition you set is true if not then don't do it it's as simple as that we'll ask a user what their age is if their age is greater than or equal to 18 they'll be allowed into our site if they're under 18 well we won't let them in let's declare variable age int age then we'll create a prompt standard output enter your age standard input age okay this is how to write an if statement you type if then a set of parenthesis then a set of curly braces if some condition within the parentheses is true you perform some subset of code we are going to check if age is greater than or equal to 18 greater than or equal to is a comparison operator there's other comparison operators such as less than or equals to less than greater than if you need to compare if two values are equal you use two equal signs you don't want to say equals cuz then you're setting age equal to 18 equals is the assignment operator so let's check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18 then we'll print a message standard output welcome to the site okay let's try this enter your age let's say that I'm 12 well it doesn't do anything since this condition EV evaluated to be false we skip over this body of code if it were true then we execute it this time my age is 21 I hit enter welcome to the site if you would rather do something else if a condition is false you can use an else statement an else statement you will place at the end there is no condition else we will print standard output you are not old enough to enter okay let's try this again enter your age I'll say that I'm 12 you are not old enough to enter that's an if statement if some condition is true you do something if not you can do something else or nothing at all there are more conditions you can check by using an else if statement we can check another condition by adding else if if this condition is false check this else if condition uh let's check to see if age is is less than zero that means somebody hasn't been born yet you haven't been born yet okay now check this out let's say that my age is -10 and I hit enter you haven't been born yet since this condition was false we skip the section of code then we check the else if statement since this condition was true we execute this body of code then skip over the else statement let's add one more Els if statement else if age is greater than or equal to 100 standard output you are too old to enter this site okay enter your age I am 120 years old I hit enter welcome to the site we check these conditions one by one starting from the top we stated that our age was 120 years old even though we were expecting to execute this body of code we instead executed this body of code within the if statement that's because our age was technically still greater than or equal to 18 so the order of your if and else if statements does matter it makes a difference if we need to execute this body of code if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 100 well then we should probably move that to the top then turn it into an if statement else if age is greater than or equal to 18 we will display this message let's try this one more time enter your age I am 120 years old I hit enter you are too old to enter this site so yeah that's an if statement you do something if a condition is true if not then you don't do it if you would rather do something else you can use an else statement if there's other conditions you would like to check before reaching the else statement you can use an else if statement and there's really no limit to these if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah those are if statements in C++ all right everybody today we're going to discuss switches a switch is an alternative to using many else if statements it Compares One value against many matching cases here's an example of what you don't want to do I have this program we have variable month month is of the integer data type the user will type in a number 1 through 12 to represent the month if month is equal to 1 it is January else if month is equal to two it is February else if month is three four five so on and so forth this is what you don't want to do because it's inefficient it's how the game yandere simulator was created if you know what that is a better solution would be to use a switch this is how to right one I'm going to delete all of this we will type switch parenthesis curly braces what value would we like to examine against matching cases let's examine our month to write a case we would type case then the value let's check to see if month is equal to one so case one colon on the next line what we want to do if month is equal to one let's display a message stand output it is January at the end of this case add break to break out of the switch so that is case one let's work on case two so case two it is February I think the rest is self-explanatory I'll speed up the footage we have our 12 cases 1 through 12 each case corresponding with a month of the year let's run this enter the month let's say that the month is Four for April it is April one more time time the month is 12th it is December so a switch is an alternative to using many else if statements it's more efficient and easier to read if there are no matching cases we can execute a default case type default then what would we like to do standard output let's say please enter in only numbers 1 through 12 enter the month uh let's type 42 please enter in only numbers 1- 12 so the default case is kind of like the else statement if there are no matching cases we execute whatever is within the default case let's try one more example this time we'll have a user enter in a character a letter grade will display a custom message depending on what grade they have Char grid standard output what letter grade standard input grade then we'll create a switch switch parenthesis curly braces we're examining our letter grade against matching cases the first case will be the character a what will we display if somebody receives an a standard output you did great then break case b standard output you did good then break case C standard output you did okay break case D standard output you did not do good break case f standard output you failed break then let's add a default case please only enter in a letter grade A through F let's try it what letter grade I received an a you did great what letter grid F you failed then let's test our default case what letter grid pizza please only enter in a letter grade A through F so yeah that's a switch everybody it's an alternative to using many else if statements it's more efficient and easier to read your assignment is to create a switch and post it in the comment section and well yeah those are switches in C++ hey guys in this video we're going to create a simple calculator program now that we know how switches work this will be a very simple program let's begin by declaring our variables at the top we'll need a character for an operator we'll name this op the operator will be either addition subtraction multiplication or division double num one double num two double result this next part isn't necessary but I'm just going to add one line of text when we begin the program I'll add a bunch of asterisks let's say calculator then I'll add a new line to the end wherever my program ends I will create another line of asterisks and I can get rid of that new line character our code for our program will be within these two lines of output let's ask the user what operand they would like standard output enter either addition subtraction multiplication or division standard input we'll store the response within the variable op standard output enter number one standard input num one let's copy these two lines paste them change one here and here now we need a switch switch parentheses curly braces we're examining our operator against matching cases the first case will be addition make sure the operand is within single quotes cuz it's a character if the user wants to add two numbers we'll take result equals num one plus num 2 display the result standard output will display the word result followed by the variable result then I'll add a new line to the end then break then we need a case force subtraction case subtraction num one minus num two multiplication case multiplication num one times num two then division case division num one / num two what if somebody doesn't type been a valid operator let's add a default case default standard output that wasn't a valid response then break I'll add a new line too okay we are good to go let's save run this calculator let's add two numbers enter number one 1.23 enter number two 3.14 the result is 4.37 let's run this again we will subtract two numbers 1.23 - 3.14 is - 1.91 let's multiply two numbers 1.23 * 3.14 that's 3 3.86 22 now we will divide two numbers 1.23 / 3.14 that is 0.39 172 let's type in an operator that's not valid how about a w enter number one 1.23 3.14 that wasn't a valid response actually I think it would be better if we said that wasn't a valid operator all right everybody that is a simple calculator program in C++ using a switch if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below if you're enjoying this series please let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro okay guys we are talking about the tary operator which is represented by a question mark followed by a colon It's a replacement to using an if else statement you write a condition then add a question mark kind of like you're asking a question is something true if that condition is true we can do some code if it's false we do some other code here's an example we have a grade my grade is 75 if grade is greater than or equal to 60 I'll output you pass else will output you fail my grade is 75 therefore I pass another way of writing this is to use the tary op operator first we write a condition so let's get rid of this if statement after our condition We'll add a question mark now parentheses are optional then we write some expression standard output you pass we do this if our condition is true colon what will we do if that condition is false well let's use whatever is within our else statement and this would work the same if my GR is 75 you pass if it's 50 you fail let's come up with a few other examples let's check to see if a number is even or odd int number equals what about nine we write a condition we'll check if number modulus 2 remember modulus gives you the remainder of any division does number divide by two evenly so this returns a one or a zero if number modulus 2 is equal to 1 question mark then let's display odd if it's false we'll display standard output even okay odd let's change number to 8 now it's even you don't necessarily need equals 1 or equals 0 the number one does correspond to true and zero corresponds to false so you could write it like this too 8 divides by two evenly that's even if it's nine that is odd okay last example let's examine a Boolean variable bull how about hungry is somebody hungry I'll set this to be true let's write our condition hungry equals true question mark now if you're examining to see if a Boolean variable is true you don't necessarily need equals true you can just say that Boolean variable hungry question mark like you're asking a question so if hungry is true we will do this standard output use are hungry colon what will we do if it's false standard output you are full hungry is set to true you are hungry if it were false you are full if we're displaying output there's a couple different ways in which we could write this it's up to you how you want to handle it so another way of writing the same code code would be standard output then within a set of parentheses then we could use our chary operator hungry question mark you are hungry else you are full this would work as well let's just check that hungry is set to false you are full let's set it to true you are hungry so yeah that's the tary operator everybody it's a question mark followed by a colon you write a condition as if you're asking a question if that condition is true you do some expression if not you do some other expression it's a replacement to an if else statement your assignment is to post a use of the trinary operator in the comment section and well yeah that's the tary operator in C++ hey guys in this video I'm going to discuss the and or as well as not logical operators we'll begin with and the and logical operator will check to see if two conditions are true here's an example we'll ask a user what the temperature is int temp short for temperature standard output this will be a prompt enter the temperature standard input put temp with the and logical operator we check to see if two or more conditions are true let's see if our temperature Falls within a certain range if condition then a set of curly braces we'll check to see if our temperature is above zero if temp is above zero and temp is less than let's say 30 in order for us to execute this if statement both of the conditions must be true this condition and this condition must be true if one of them is false we skip over this if statement so if our temperature Falls within that range the temperature is good else standard output the temperature is bad okay let's try it enter the temperature uh let's say it's 25° this will be in Celsius the temperature is good let's try it again uh what about -100° CSI uh the temperature is bad yeah no kidding one more time uh positive 100° C the temperature is bad so with the and logical operator we check to see if two or more conditions are true there's another way of writing the same program too we can use the or logical operator which is represented by two vertical bars it checks to see if at least one of two conditions are true if temp is less than or equal to zero or temp is greater than or equal to 30 the temperature is bad else the temp temperature is good in order for us to execute this if statement only one condition has to be true if both of them are false we don't do anything what's the temperature the temperature is 25 that's within that range the temperature is good one more time enter the temperature it is1 100° C the temperature is bad all right so that's the and as well as the or logical operator there's one more the not logical operator which is an exclamation point it reverses The Logical state of its operand meaning if a condition is true it becomes false if it's originally false it becomes true let's create another variable this will be a Boolean sunny sunny can be true or false I'll write another if statement if Sunny is equal to true now if you're examining to see if a Boolean variable is true you don't necessarily need to say equals true you could just type the name of the Boolean variable if Sunny if Sunny is true we'll display a message standard output it is sunny outside else standard output it is cloudy outside okay one more time enter the temperature it's 20° C I should probably add some new line characters there enter the temperature it's 25° C the temperature is good it is sunny outside if we use the not logical operator we can preed a condition with an exclamation point we're checking to see if it's not Sunny that means we would want to change our output if is cloudy outside else it is sunny outside let's change Sunny to be false enter the temperature it is 50° C the temperature is bad it is cloudy outside so yeah everybody those are logical operators and or not your assignment is to use either the and or or otherwise not logical operator then post it in the comment section down below whatever you wrote so yeah those are logical operators in C+ Plus+ okay guys in this video we're going to create a temperature conversion program to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius or Celsius to Fahrenheit at the top of our program let's declare our variables double temp temp is short for temperature then Char unit will the user select Celsius or Fahrenheit now with my programs I like to add a title at the beginning standard output temperature conversion it's totally not necessary but it's something that I like to do then I'll add another line of output at the end of my program to show the user that the program is over I'll just add a bunch of asterisks like I said totally not necessary but it's something I just like to do I will display a couple lines of output f equals fenit I can never spell Fahrenheit right I think that's okay I'll add a new line standard output C equals Celsius add a new line standard output what unit would you like to convert to standard input unit the user will hopefully type in F or C depending on what they want to convert to let's check to see if the user types in F first if unit is equal to the character F that's a capital f but you know maybe the user types in lowercase St I'll add an or conditional operator or you is equal to a lowercase f that's also a valid response if the user would like to convert a temperature to Fahrenheit these are the steps we can do standard output enter the temperature in celsius standard input temp to store the temperature to convert our temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit we can assign temp equal to now here's the formula 1.8 * R temp plus 32 then we will display the temperature standard output temperature is temp degrees Fahrenheit then I'll add a new line if the user would like to convert to Celsius I'll add an else if statement else if unit is equal to the character Capital C or unit is equal to the character lowercase C we can copy these two lines of code and reuse them we'll just repurpose them enter the temperature in Fahrenheit here is the formula to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius temp equals our current temperature - 32 / 1.8 then let's display our temperature I'll copy this line of code paste it Che change Fahrenheit to Celsius now what if the user doesn't type in a valid response else standard output please enter in only C or F add a new line and that should be everything let's try this temperature conversion program what unit would you like to convert to I would like to convert to to Fahrenheit enter the temperature in celsius so what's 0° C converted to Fahrenheit that is 32° Fahrenheit let's go again let's convert to Celsius enter the temperature in fahrenheit what's 100° in Celsius 37.7 de Celsius let's type in a response that's not valid uh I would like to convert to Pizza please enter in only C or F all right everybody that is a program to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa I thought we could use some practice using conditional operators as well as if statements if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a temperature conversion program in C++ hey what's going on everybody so in this video I'm going to explain some useful string method methods that you might be interested in let's begin by creating a variable named name standard string name we'll accept some user input we'll need a prompt standard output enter your name a user's name may contain spaces we're better off using the getline function standard getline standard CN name the first useful method is the length method type your string name follow it with DOT length parentheses the length method will give you the length of a string let's write this within an if statement if name. length method is greater than 12 we'll print a message such as your name can't be over 12 characters long standard output your name can't be over 12 characters else we'll print a different message standard output welcome the user's name enter your name type in your full name welcome whatever your name is okay now what if our name is over 12 characters type in your full name then just add a bunch of characters your name can't be over 12 characters that is the built-in length method of strings you type a string follow it with DOT length parentheses wherever you invoke this method in that spot you will return the length of that string in characters the empty method will will return if a string is empty or not type your string name. empty parentheses this returns a Boolean value if name is empty we'll display a message you didn't enter your name else hello whatever your name is okay I'm just going to hit enter you didn't enter your name but if I do enter my name it works normally hello whatever your name is that is the empty method of strings you'll check to see if a string is empty or not a useful case of this is to check to see if somebody enters in some user input another is clear name. CLE then let's display our name standard output hello name enter your name type in your first name and last name hello and we don't have a name anymore because that name has been cleared so that is the clear method we can append a string to another string after my name I will use append parentheses within the parenthesis we can add a string to the end of another string I'll add gmail.com standard output your username is now name andent to your name your username is your name with gmail.com appended to it that is the append method we can return a character at a given position within a string standard output type your string name do at parentheses so the first character in a string has an index of zero I'll display whatever that character is Ander your name so the first character in my string is a capital B the character at index one well that would be R we can insert a character at a given position type your string follow it with insert there will be two arguments will list within the parentheses and index so the beginning of our string would have an index of zero comma then what would we like to insert I'll insert the at sign at the beginning of my name then let's display our name okay so we we now have the at sign inserted at the beginning of our string or you could pick a different position the index of one would be the second character technically so yeah pick a position then you can insert a string now we can find a certain character I would like to find if there's any spaces within my name name. find then place a character I'll look for any white spaces this method will give me the position of the first space type in your first name and last name the index of the first White space within my name has an index of three the first character is always zero 0 1 2 three okay then lastly erase name. erase we can erase a portion of a string we'll need a beginning index and an ending index I'll eliminate the first three characters then we will display our name enter your name okay and that's what's left in my name I deleted the first three characters the first number is the beginning index the second is the ending index it's not inclusive though so yeah those are a few helpful string Methods if you would like to know more head to the string class on the C+ plus.com website and there's a fairly extensive list hey if you're enjoying the series let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey hey everybody in this video I'm going to explain while Loops a while loop is much like an if statement except we can repeat some code potentially an infinite amount of times here's an example of where a while loop would be useful let's say that we'll have a user entering their name standard string name at first I'll use an if statement if name I'll check to see if the name is empty did the user actually type in something if name is empty we'll create a prompt standard output enter your name standard getline standard input name once we exit the if statement we'll display a message involving the user's name standard output hello name enter your name I'm just going to hit enter and not entering anything hello and I don't have a name what if we need to force the user to do something in order to continue with the rest of the program well we could change this if statement to a while loop if this condition remains true we will execute this code a potentially infinite amount of times once we reach the end of this code block we check the condition again if it's still true we repeat the code again enter your name I'm going to hit enter enter your name no enter your name no enter your name no so I can't actually continue with the rest of my program until I type in something I'll type in my full name hit enter hello whatever your name is basically speaking a while loop is kind of like an if statement except it can repeat some code infinitely as long as this condition remains true we check this condition once when we enter the while loop then anytime we finish the while loop we check the condition again if the condition is false we exit then continue on with the rest of the program you do want some way to exit the while loop let's write a condition that we won't be able to change it all while one is equal to one there's no way we can escape this while loop so this is what's known as an infinite Loop I'll display a message help I'm stuck in an infinite Loop then when I run this yeah we're stuck in an infinite Loop and we can't actually move on or do anything so yeah that's basically a while loop everybody while some condition that you set remains true you will continue to execute some code a great use of a while loop is that you can force a user to do something in order to continue with the rest of the code your assignment is to use a while loop then post it in the comment section down below and well you yeah those are while Loops in C++ all right everybody do while Loops a do while loop it does some block of code first and then you repeat that block of code if a condition is true here's an example let's write a program that will ask a user to enter in a positive number first we'll use a while loop that'll demonstrate how a do while loop would actually be better for the situation we have an integer number int number I'll write a while loop while number is less than zero we will prompt the user to enter in a positive number enter a positive number okay standard input number outside of the while loop at the end of our program let's display the number standard output the number is number so this isn't going to work normally here's why let's run this the number is zero so this is what's going on we've declared our number but have not assigned a value quite yet when we reach the while loop we check the condition if the condition is true we execute this block of code since we've declared an integer variable but have not assigned it a value it's defaulting to just zero 0 is not less than zero so so this condition is false that means we skip the while loop and continue on another way in which we could write this but it's not the best solution is that we could copy what's within this block of code then run it once if number is still less than zero we would then execute this block of code repeatedly let's try this again okay enter a positive number 1 2 3 the number is 1 2 3 let's type in a negative number negative 1 enter a positive number negative 1 enter a positive number 1 so I can't actually continue until I enter in a positive number you know this does work but there's a much better way of writing this because you know we're repeating at least two lines of code when we really don't need to we need to run this block of code once and then repeat it if this condition is true well you know what would be great for that a Doh Loop let's eliminate these two lines of code to create a do while loop we will move this condition to the end while then our condition preceding the left curly brace right do do this code once and then check the condition make sure you have a semicolon at the end let's try it again enter a positive number I'm just going to type in a negative number negative 1 nope 1 nope how about a positive number 1 2 3 the number is 1 2 3 so that's a do while loop you do some block of code first then you repeat it again if the condition is true it's an optional way to repeat some code one good use of a do while loop that comes to mind maybe we're playing a game we would like to run the game once at the end of the game a user can choose if they would like to play again based on the user's input if they would like to play again we can run the game one more time repeatedly so that's a do while loop everybody I'll post this code in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a do while loop in C++ all right guys in this video I'm going to explain for Loops a for Loop is a loop that will execute a block of code a specified amount of times to create a for Loop we type for parentheses curly braces within the for Loop there are up to three statements that we can add the first is that we can create an index a sort of counter int index I'll set the equal to be we'll start at one then finish the statement with a semicolon now what a lot of people do instead of saying index they'll just shorten this to I the second statement is a stopping condition let's count up to three I'll continue this as long as I is less than or equal to three then semicolon to finish that statement the third statement is that we can increment or decrement our counter our index I'll increment my index by one by saying i++ okay let's repeat something Three Times Standard output how about happy New Year Happy New Year here this code should be repeated three times happy New Year happy New Year Happy New Year I should probably add a new line now let's try this five times we'll begin I at one we'll continue this as long as I is less than or equal to 5 okay 1 2 3 4 5 that's it this time let's count up to 10 then display happy New Year once we exit out of the for Loop I'll move this line to outside of the for Loop I'll set I to be 1 we'll continue this as long as I is less than or equal to 10 during each iteration of the for loop I will display whatever I is standard output I then I'll add a new line okay here we go go we're starting at one then we're counting up to 10 then we escape the for Loop once we escape the for Loop then we print happy New Year when you increment or decrement your counter you can skip iterations let's increase I by two after each iteration I plus equals 2 now we're counting up by twos 1 357 9 Happy New Year we can even set our index to be a different number let's begin at Z we're still counting up by twos 0 2 4 6 8 Happy New Year we could even increment I by three 0369 happy New Year or we could decrement and go backwards iusus this time we will begin at 10 then continue as long as I is less than or equal to zero so this would be a countdown 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 happy New Year okay let's decrement I by two after each iteration IUS = 2 108 6420 happy New Year so yeah everybody that's a for Loop there's a lot of overlap where you could use either a while loop or a for Loop for Loops tend to be better in situations where you only need to repeat code a certain amount of times your assignment is to post a use of the for Loop in the comment section down below and well yeah those are for Loops in C++ hey everybody so in this video I'm going to explain the break and the continue keywords the break keyword will break out of a loop another place where you see this is a switch within a switch statement continue will skip the current iteration here's an example let's create a for Loop that will count up to the number 20 I'll set I equal to B1 I will continue this as long as I is less than or equal to 20 then increment I by One standard out out put I'll display whatever I is then I'll add a new line new line then let's take a look so we have the numbers 1 through 20 I would like to skip the number 13 because 13 is considered an unlucky number I know it's a weird example what I'll do is use an if statement within my for Loop if I is equal to 13 first we'll break then see what happens if we break where I equal 13 then we have the numbers 1 through 12 once we hit 13 we break out of the loop we do not finish the rest of the iterations if we replace break with continue this is instead what happens we have the numbers 1 through 20 but the number 13 isn't there so using the continue keyword we skip the current iteration so yeah that's the break and the continue keywords these keywords are available if you need them but where you'll use them it really depends but just so you know they exist and that is the break and the continue keywords in C++ all right guys we are on nested Loops a nested Loop is just a loop that's inside of another loop it doesn't matter what kind of loop you're working with it can be a while loop or a four Loop or whatever here's an example we'll create a loop to count the numbers 1 through 10 we'll count to 10 three times so let's create a basic Loop for now in I I'll set this equal to be 1 the condition will be I is less than or equal to 10 then I will increment I by 1 during each iteration I will display whatever I is then I'll add a space there this Loop will count up to 10 just like that so now I would like to count up to 10 three times Well I can stick this Loop in another loop so let's create the outer loop for in I I'll set this equal to be one I'll continue this as long as I is less than or equal to 3 then increment I by 1 so I'm going to take this Loop and stick it within the curly braces of the outer for Loop however you don't want these Loops to have the same index a common naming convention for the inner loop is to use J as the counting index j j j j okay let's take a look okay now we count up to 10 three times but what I think I'm going to do is that every time we exit the for Loop the inner for Loop I'll just print a new line character standard output new line yeah that's much better so yeah nested Loop is just a loop inside of another loop just as a practice project let's create a program that will print a rectangle made out of symbols we'll let a user specify how many rows and columns we'll use our Nesta Loop that we created previously so we have int rows int columns then char symbol we're going to ask for some user input we'll need some prompts standard output how many rows standard input rows let's copy this paste it change rows to columns then enter a symbol to use standard input symbol we'll continue printing rows as long as I is less than or equal to rows whatever we typed in we don't want any more rows than what the user wants the inner loop is going to be in charge of the columns J is less than or equal to columns in place of printing J let's print our symbol whatever the user picked and we do not need to separate these with any spaces all right let's try this how many rows what about three rows then six columns enter a symbol to use what about the at sign and there's our rectangle there's three rows and six columns let's try it one last time how about four rows and five columns I'll use a dollar sign okay we have four rows 1 2 3 4 five columns 1 2 3 4 5 so yeah everybody that's a nested loop it's a loop that's inside of another loop when you'll use these it really depends on the situation I thought this would be a fun practice project if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah those are nested Loops in C++ hey this is bro from the future before you begin this topic to work with random numbers you may need to include this header file C time hey everybody in this video I'm going to show you how we can generate some random numbers just so you know these are pseudo random numbers they're not truly random but they're close maybe if you need to roll a six-sided dice for a game well then this would work perfect to generate some random numbers we'll need to initialize the random number generator by typing s Rand add a set of parentheses semicolon within the S Rand function we'll need a seed what programmers typically do is that they'll use the current calendar time as a seed within the parenthesis type time parentheses again then pass in null I'll store the first random number within a variable int num equals to generate a random number we invoke the Rand function then I'll display this let's take a look to see what we have standard output num okay the random number that we have is 3,231 using the Rand function this will generate a random number between 0 and 32,767 but we don't necessarily need a number that large I just need to roll a six-sided dice well what we're going to do is follow this with modulus than the range of numbers we would like if I'm rolling a six-sided dice I'll type modulus 6 modulus gives you the remainder of any division so take whatever number We Roll divide it by six take the remainder and that's our number but there's one issue with this we have five 2 and zero technically the range of numbers is currently 0 through 5 if we need 1 through six what we can do is add one plus 1 this should give us a random number between 1 and and six there it is six so I tend to play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons there's polyhedral dice one die that we commonly roll is a 20-sided dice so if I would need a random number between 1 and 20 I would say Rand function modulus 20 my random number is one wow that's surprisingly low then I have a 14 maybe you need a random number between 1 and 100 Rand function modu 100 my random number between 1 and 100 is 67 now I need to roll three six-sided dice I'm going to create three variables let's name this num one Rand function modulus 6 + one then let's copy this paste it twice we have num one num two num three let's display num one I'll add a new line then do this two more times for Num two and num three so our three dice that we're rolling are 5 22 then again 3 1 4 yeah everybody that's how to generate some pseudo random numbers they're not truly random but they're close if you have a simple game you're working on this would work perfect if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to generate some some random numbers in C++ hey everybody in this topic we're going to create a random event generator using random numbers and a switch this might be useful maybe if you're writing a game you need some random event to occur like random monsters show up or the weather changes anything like that we'll be working with random numbers you may need to include this header file include C time cuz we need access to the time function to work with random numbers will need to generate a seed s Rand function pass in time pass in zero this function will use the current time as a seed to Generate random numbers we'll create a local variable to store our random number int Rand num equals use the Rand function modulus then what's the range of numbers you would like I would like the numbers 1 through five but this will give us 0 through four so I'm going to add one to the end my integer random num will be a random number between 1 and five I'm going to create a switch to examine this random number against many matching cases so we have case one through five if the random number is one what would you like to do exactly so in this program I think we're going to give away prizes like it's a random prize generator depending on the random number we'll give a participant a random prize standard output you win how about a bumper sticker a bumper sticker that will be the lowest tier prize then we should probably add a break to break out of the switch okay let's think of some others and I should probably break after these prize two will be a t-shirt prize three how about a free lunch prize four maybe a gift card case five concert tickets that sounds good so when I run this program we'll generate a random number between 1 and 5 depending on what that number is we'll execute the code found within one of these cases let's see what I won I won a free lunch if I try this again there's a good chance it'll be a different prize this time I won a bumper sticker I want a bumper sticker again come on I want those concert tickets I'll take a a gift card that's not bad now if you don't add these break statements you'll just fall through the switch you want a gift card you want concert tickets so if you only want somebody to win one prize you'll want to exit out of the switch by including this break statement so yeah everybody I thought that might be an interesting program you can generate some random event maybe it's for a game or something I thought maybe a random prize giveaway would kind of be interesting this program is more or less for practice your assignment is to write a switch with some random events then post it in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a random event generator using C++ all right welcome back everybody in this video we're going to create a simple number guessing game Let's declare our variables int num our number will be randomly generated int guess this variable will hold the current player gu int tries how many tries is it going to take for the user to guess the correct number we'll be using the srand function to generate some random numbers pass in time pass in null we will assign our variable num a random number between 1 and 100 Rand function modulus 100 then add one this function will give us a random number between 1 in 100 start with a num just for some decorations I'm going to create a title for this game number guessing game then add a new line I'll place all of this code within a do while loop do while our guess does not equal num we will have the user type in another guess we'll create a prompt standard output enter a guess between 1 through 100 standard input guess once the user types in guess we will increment our tries variable by one to keep track of the score now we'll have to examine the guess versus the number if guess is greater than num let's display too high I'll add a new line else if gas is less than num then we'll display to low else if the guess is not above the number and the guess is not below the number the guess must be equal to the number standard output correct we'll display the number of tries number of tries we'll display our tries variable I'll add a new line and I'll just add a line of text for decoration at the bottom once we exit the game that should be everything let's run this number guessing game I'll guess something right in the middle 50 too low okay so the number is between 50 and 100 I'll guess right in the middle of that range 75 too high something between 50 and 75 perhaps 62 that's still too high 56 too high 53 to low 54 55 all right the correct guess was 55 it took me seven tries I don't really think that's too good but it works okay everybody that is a simple number guessing game involving the use of do while loops and generating random numbers if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below if you're enjoying the series please let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro well well well everybody we have a pretty important lesson today today we're going to talk about functions a function is a block of reusable code if you ever think that you're going to use some section of code more than once you might as well stick it within a function here's an example I'll create a function to sing Happy Birthday currently our program is within the main function to begin the program we call the main function before the main function we can create a new function for the time being we're going to type void then a unique function name the function name should be descriptive of what it does if I'm going to sing Happy Birthday let's name this function the happy birthday function then add a set of parenthesis then a set of curly braces you can see that this is almost identical to our main function except with the main function we have a return type and return zero what would we like to do when we invoke this function let's sing some of the lyrics to Happy Birthday standard output happy birthday to you add a new line I'll repeat this a couple times happy birthday dear you happy birthday to you to invoke this function all we have to do is within the main function type the function name followed by a set of parentheses this will call or otherwise known as invoke the function I like to think of the parentheses as a pair of telephones that are talking to each other to use a function you have to call the function call it up on the phone so when I run this code we have the lyrics to Happy Birthday this function is reusable I can call this function as many times as I want I'll call this function two additional times just to separate these lyrics I'm going to add an additional new line character okay we now should have three verses of happy birthday 1 2 3 that's because I called the function well three times a function is just a block of reusable code now what a lot of people do is that they'll declare and Define their functions after after the main function because it's more readable to many people but there's one issue with this happy birthday was not declared in this scope our programs are read from the top down since we're invoking the happy birthday function before we even know what it is well the compiler doesn't recognize it a solution to this is that before the main function you can declare functions but Define them later let's declare happy birthday before the main function then make sure you add a void or a return type so void happy birthday we can now use this function even though it's after the main function a lot of people like to Define their functions after the main function it's another way in which you can write it just be sure to at least declare them before the main function now check this out what if we have a variable standard string name assign this whatever your name is I'm going to use this name that's declared in the main function and use it within the happy birthday function let's replace you with the user's name happy birthday to name I'll add a new line then I'll copy this paste it and let's change this line as well all right now when I run this here's the issue name was not declared in the scope think of each function as a house the main function is your house functions outside of the main function would be your neighbors their house functions can't see what's going on inside of other functions you can't see what's going on inside of your neighbor's house you're only familiar with what's going on inside of your own house in order for the happy birthday function to use the main function's name variable it needs to be made aware of it to do that when you invoke a neighboring function you can pass that variable or some other value as an argument So within the parentheses when you invoke that function place your values or variables I would like to make my happy birthday function aware of this name variable within the main function when you send some data over to a function that data is also known as an argument however the receiving function needs a matching set of what are called parameters if this function is going to receive this data this name you need a matching parameter to set up a parameter you first list the data type we will receive a standard string then we can list a parameter name let's say name now this happy birthday function can use this name variable within the main function if you have a function declaration at the top of your program you'll have to add that parameter there as well so happy birthday standard string and we can run this happy birthday to whatever your name is functions aren't aware of what's going on inside of other functions but you can make them aware of any local variables or values by passing them as an argument but you'll need a matching set of parameters the name or otherwise unique identifier of your parameter doesn't necessarily need to have the same name so to say you can name it something else instead of naming our parameter name let's say birthday boy or birthday girl happy birthday to birthday boy and that should work the same so you can rename parameters but let's revert that back now let's pass an age int age equals make up some age I would like to send my age over to the Happy Birthday function so I will pass that as an additional argument separate each argument with a comma we'll send our name as well as age now we need a matching set of parameters right now the happy birthday function is only equipped to receive a name so we list the data type int age and if you have a function declaration change that there as well then I'll add one more line you are age years old then this should work okay happy birthday to whatever your name is you are whatever your age is years old so that's a function everybody it's a block of reusable code if you think you're going to perform some code more than once you can stick it within a function whenever you need it you just simply call it if you need to make your function aware of any variables you can send them as arguments to that function but you'll need a matching set of parameters in the function definition and the Declaration so yeah those are functions everybody your assignment is to create a unique function and post it in the comment section and well yeah those are functions in C++ all right everybody we are on the return keyword the return keyword will return a value back to the spot where you called the encompassing function the return keyword is commonly found at the end of a function much like the main function when we invoke a function we can return some value back here's an example I'll create a function that will calculate the area of a square but we'll need to pass in a length the length of one side this will be double length assign some value 5.0 is good then we'll need to declare and Define a function at the top of my program I'll add a function declaration for the time being we'll write void but that will change soon void I'll name this function Square we will square a length list any parameters we will accept a double value which we will name length then I'll need a function definition I'll add that after the main function void Square I'm going to create a temporary variable named result it will be of the double data type we will take length time length to calculate the area then I will use that return keyword return what are we returning we're returning our result if we're returning a value we need to change this keyword void to match the DAT type of what we're returning we're returning a double so I will change void to double and then make sure you change that within the function declaration as well double square you could do this in one line of code you don't necessarily need to we could simply just return length time length that is also valid that's probably how I would write it we now have this function that will calculate the area of a square once we pass in a length I'm going to create a new variable called area it will be of the double data type and I will set this equal to then let's invoke the square function pass in our length variable as an argument at this point of the program area should be assigned a value let's display it standard output area I'll add my area variable then add cm squared then new line the area of our square is 25 cm squar and I could change this to a different number like six the area is now 36 cm squared let's create another function this function will find the volume of a cube if we know the length of a side we'll return a value of the double data type but I will name this Cube we will still accept the length of the double data type let's copy this paste it change Square to cube return length time length time length double volume equals we'll invoke our Cube function pass in our length then I will display whatever the volume is volume my volume variable cm cubed if the side of a square is 6 cm the area would be 36 if it was a cube the volume would be 216 CM if you need to return a value back to the spot in which you invoked a function be sure to list the data type of what you're returning let's try another example involving strings I'll create a function that will add a user's first name their last name and create a new string called full name let's declare our variables standard string first name equals add your first name standard string last name equals add your last name then I'll create a function to concatenate two strings together we're returning a string I will list the data type as standard string I'll name this function concat strings we will have two arguments two standard strings standard string I'll name the first string string one standard string string I misspelled string string two so we have our function declaration now we just need to Define it I'm going to return string one plus I'll add a space between the first name and the last name plus string two I'll create a third variable standard string full name equals I will invoke my concat strings function then I need to pass in two strings as arguments I'll pass in my first name and my last name then let's display the full name stand output hello the users's full name Hello Bro Code or whatever your first and last name is so yeah everybody that is the return keyword wherever you invoke a function you can return a value back to that spot in which you invoked that function if you're returning a value just be sure that you change the return type of that function to match the data type of the value being returned in this example I returned a string a standard string so the return type of this function would be a standard string so that's the return keyword everybody your assignment is in the comment section to post a function that returns some value so yeah that is the return keyword in C++ hey guys in this topic I'm going to explain overloaded functions in C++ and actually with many other programming languages you can have different versions of the same function here's what I mean I have a function to bake a pizza because well I like pizza Bake Pizza this function will have no parameters all I'm going to do within this function is display the words here is your pizza then I'll add a new line uh then I should probably add a declaration at the top void bake pizza then to invoke this function I would type the function name here is your pizza this time I would like to bake a pizza that has toppings right now we just have a plain pizza with no toppings and that's kind of lame I'm going to create an additional version of this baked pizza method but it's going to have different parameters void bake pizza we will accept a string stand standard string I'll name this string topping one we'll accept one topping as an argument standard output here is your I'll add my topping here topping one pizza then be sure to add your function declaration too bake pizza then this time we are accepting a string it is valid for functions to share the same name but you need a different set of parameters a function's name plus its parameters is known as a function signature I can bake a pizza that has no toppings here is your pizza or I could pass in a topping like pepperoni here is your pepperoni pizza let's create an additional function that accepts two toppings so we have topping one topping two here is your top toing one and Topping two pizza then add your function declaration topping one topping two now I can bake a pizza that has two toppings I would like pepperoni and mushrooms here is your pepperoni and mushroom pizza so yeah everybody those are overloaded functions functions can share the same name but you need a different set of parameters a function's name plus its parameters is known as a function's signature and each function signature needs to be unique kind of like an ID so yeah those are overloaded functions if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah those are overloaded functions in C++ okay everybody we got to discuss variable scope I'll explain local variables and Global variables local variables are declared inside of a function or block of curly braces such as within the main function or inside of another function Global variables are declared outside of all functions you tend to see them at the top of your program there's some major differences between the two let's begin with local variables suppose I have some number int my num my num equals 1 if I need to display my num I can use standard output my num and of course this will display my num which is one now what if I have a function to display my num void print num let's move this line of code to our print num function I'll need to add a function declaration to the top of my program then we will invoke this function print num okay this isn't going to work and here's why my num was not declared in this scope functions can't see inside of other functions my function print num has no idea what this my num variable is my num is a local variable to the main function that's why we pass arguments to functions we'll make the function aware of this value but you'll need a matching set of parameters int my num then add that to the function declaration in my num and this would work that displays the number one but let's get rid of these parameters it is legal to reuse the same variable name as long as it's within a different scope within the print num function I'll also have a my num variable that has the same name but I'll give this a different value when printing my num it prints two we have two versions of the same variable and this is fine because they're within different scopes now a global variable is declared outside of all functions you see these at the top of your program I will declare int my num equals 3 I'm going to delete these two local variables if I was to invoke the print num function and print my num well then that number is three This Global variable is also available within the main function so I will print my num here as well within the main function so we have three and three it's best to avoid Global variables if you can because it pollutes the global namespace also variables declared within a function are much more secure because like I said functions can't see inside of other functions if we had both local and Global variables my num within the main function will be one within the print num function it will be two if I was to display my num for both of these I'm going to add a new line to each of new line and new line a function will use any local variables first before resorting to any Global variables that's why our print num function prints 2 and the main function prints one if you'd rather use the global version you can use the scope resolution operator so precede your variable name with two colons that is the scope resolution operator I'll do that here as well in place of using the local version of myum we will use the global version and we will print three we're using the global version of my num instead of the local version so yeah that's variable scope local variables are declared inside of a function or anytime you see a set of curly braces a variable declared inside a set of curly braces is hidden to the outside world a global variable is declared outside of all functions and is accessible to all functions within the program like I said you should try and avoid using Global variables if you can because it pollutes the global namespace and these variables are less secure so yeah that's variable scope hey if you're enjoying this series let me know by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey guys in this topic we're going to create a banking program for practice we'll be able to deposit money withdraw money and and show a balance this is more or less just for practice let's begin by creating our functions void show balance there will be one parameter double balance whatever our bank account balance is will show it the return type is double deposit no parameters double withdraw and there will be one parameter double balance let's fill in a few things within the main function double balance and I will go ahead and set this to zero as well as int choice I will set that to zero as well we'll use a switch to determine if the user wants to show their balance make a deposit a withdrawal or exit let's display some output some prompts standard output enter your choice and I'm just going to add some text decorations because I think that'll be cool maybe a bunch of as risks and one more okay we have option one one show balance two will be deposit money three is withdraw money four will be exit then we'll accept some user input standard input choice now we're going to create a switch we're examining the user's choice switch we're examining our choice against many matching cases we have case one case two 3 4 then a default case Okay case one the user wants to show their balance will'll invoke the show balance function but we need to pass in our balance balance and then we are going to break case two the user wants to deposit money so we're going to take our balance equals balance plus our deposit function so deposit will return a double right here so we're going to add that to our balance once we verify it actually we can shorten this too balance plus equals whatever value is returned with the deposit function then we are going to break case three withdraw money balance minus equals the withdraw function pass in our balance we're withdrawing money from our balance once we verify it then we're going to break we'll exit with case 4 I'll display some output standard output thanks for visiting then I'm going to break K default case standard output invalid Choice okay now we're going to place all of this code within a do while loop do all of this while some condition is true so let's take all of this code cut it put it within that do while loop let me just format this a little bit the condition will be while Choice does not equal four four is what we used to exit we'll need to add some function definitions but I'm going to fill these in later we'll need to return something so let's return zero for the time being for two of these functions at least return zero okay let's run and compile this just to test our do while loop okay enter your choice uh one show balance that doesn't show our balance yet but it will deposit money withdraw now we should be able to exit by pressing four thanks for visiting okay so we know that the do while loop is working let's fill in our functions let's begin with show balance now with the show balance function we're receiving our balance as an argument so I'm going to display standard output your balance is dollar sign or some other currency if you choose I'll display our balance then add a new line so let's say we have $123 in our account I'm going to show my balance $123 even but I would like to display cents I'll need two decimal places after the decimal so there's one thing we can include we'll include this header file include IO man IP there's a function in here to set some precision for floating Point numbers I'm going to make this change after the dollar sign standard set Precision pass in two for two decimal places then add standard fixed this will display our balance up to two decimal places after the decimal point so let's try that again okay show balance $123 and0 if I were to change this to 123.0 one we should display two decimal places yep $123 And1 okay that is the show balance function let's work on the deposit function okay now we're within the deposit function I'm going to create a local variable named amount set this equal to zero we'll ask the user how much they would like to deposit standard output enter amount to be deposited standard input our amount so I'm going to set balance back to zero then let's test it show balance one your balance is $0 and0 I would like to make a deposit uh $420 69 okay now I would like to show my balance after we make a deposit so within case two after making a deposit let's show our balance pass in the balance variable H let's do so after a withdrawal too okay let's try that again show balance $0 0 make a deposit $420 69 your balance is $0 cents so what we're going to do is return our amount at the end of this function return amount $420 69 all right we have our balance the user is able to enter in negative money enter amount to be deposited 1,000 your balance is now $1,000 we need to prevent somebody from making a negative deposit so before we return our amount let's use an if statement if amount is greater than zero then we will return the amount else standard output that's not a valid amount then let's return zero okay let's try that again deposit money negative $1,000 that's not a valid amount your balance is 0 I'm just going to add a new line like right here then let's make a legitimate deposit deposit money I will deposit $1,000 And1 your balance is $11,000 And1 okay that is the deposit function that is complete then we have the withdraw function we'll create a local variable named amount of the double data type we'll create a prompt standard output enter amount to be withdrawn standard input amount and at the end of this program we will return amount okay let's test it okay I need to deposit some money first I will deposit $1,000 and 1 C then let's withdraw money I will withdraw $100 and 1ent my new balance is $900 but we can overdraw our account still so I'm going to withdraw a million doll and 1 cent our balance shouldn't be negative so let's prevent our user from overdrafting their account within our withdraw function let's add an if statement if amount is greater than our balance will display insufficient funds then we will return zero okay I'm going to withdraw $1 million and one cent insufficient funds your balance is zero okay now what if the user would like to deposit negative money withdraw money negative 1,000 your balance is $1,000 we'll need to make sure that the amount is a legitimate amount I'll add an L if statement if amount is less than zero stand standard output that's not a valid amount now else we will return the amount to be withdrawn then within the lse if statement we'll need to return zero there okay let's withdraw money enter amount to be withdrawn $1,000 that's not a valid amount that's good let's withdraw again I would like to withdraw $100 in sufficient funds my balance is zero let's deposit some money $99.99 our balance is $99 99 let's withdraw again let's try and withdraw $100 nope we can't let's withdraw again $999.99 your balance is zero that's good then let's exit press for to exit thanks for visiting okay so these functions are done there's just one more thing we should add if I type in some characters like the word Pizza well this will break our program we'll want to clear the input buffer so after our choice let's add these two lines standard input. clear function so I haven't talked about this function this function will reset any airor Flags when the standard input fails to interpret the input then follow this with f flush this is a function pass in standard input this will clear the input buffer basically speaking once we hit enter we have a new line character within our input buffer so we just need to flush that and get rid of it that should prevent our program from going crazy so let's type in some characters invalid Choice cool then I would like to exit all right everybody that is a banking program for some practice if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a banking practice program in C++ all right everybody in this video we're going to create a game of rock paper scissors let's create our function declarations first Char get user choice Char in this case would be the return type we'll be returning a character Char get computer Choice void there is no return type show Choice there will be one parameter Char Choice then the last function is void choose winner there will be two parameters Char player that's us Char computer the computer's choice will be determined randomly using a random number generator let's define these functions let's copy all of these after the main function I will paste them then add a set of curly braces after each currently if I were to run this program we do have some warning because with these two functions get user choice and get computer choice we're not returning anything even though we stated that we're returning a character just for the time being I'm going to return zero just so that those warnings go away but we'll correct these momentarily so we shouldn't have those warnings within the main function we will declare two characters one for player Char player that's us Char computer that's the opponent we will take our player then assign this a value of whatever is returned from the get user Choice function then we need to fill in this function within the get user Choice function I will create a local variable of player as well I'll create a message to begin our game standard output rock paper scissors game I'll add a new line uh this part isn't necessary but I'm just going to add a bunch of asterisks afterward just because I think it would look cool underneath our title let's list our choices standard output the character R for rock new line let's copy this P for paper s for scissors standard input player I'm just going to test that this works standard output Player rock paper scissors game R for rock P for paper s for scissors I'll pick r that would give us the character R okay so we know that that works I'm going to place some of this code within a do while loop because the user might not type in RP or S so do while I'm going to stick my code within the do while loop I'm just going to add one more line of output choose one of the following all right we'll continue this while loop as long as our player does not equal the character r and player does not equal the character p and player does not equal the character s then at the end of this function we will return player we can't escape this while loop until we pick either r p or S that's how this condition works Let's test it rock paper SC game choose one of the following R for rock P for paper s for scissors uh I will pick W for womo choose one of the following r p or S uh I like the letter X nope can't pick that uh let's go with s for scissors okay s is a valid Choice okay that is the get user Choice function that is complete so I'm going to close out of this function after we assign our player variable let's display the user's Choice standard output your choice colon space then we will invoke the show Choice function show Choice then there is one parameter we have to pass in a choice as an argument we will pass in our player that's a character within the show Choice function I'm going to create a switch switch we're examining some value against matching cases we'll examine our choice our choice argument that we receive if our choice matches the case r what would we like to do I'm going to display some output standard output just rock then I'll add a new line make sure to break then case P for paper standard output paper I'll add a new line then break case s for scissors standard output scissors new line then break let's close out of this function then test it okay I'll type R for rock your choice Rock P for paper your choice paper s for scissors your choice scissors okay the show Choice function is done now we need to get the computer Choice computer equals get computer Choice then we'll need to fill in this function get computer choice right here we'll need to generate a random seed s Rand pass in the time function then type zero or null you may need to include this header file at the top of your program just in case this doesn't work include C time we'll generate a random number between 1 and three and num equals Grand function modulus 3 + 1 we'll examine this number against matching cases switch we're examining our num the first case will be the number one if our random number is one let's return the character R since we're returning a value we don't necessarily need to add that break statement we're already breaking when we return so we can Emmit this case 2 return the character P for paper case three return s for scissors okay we can close out of the get computer Choice function that's all done back within the main function let's display the computer's Choice standard output computer's Choice we'll invoke the show Choice function but pass in our computer let's run it to test it I'll pick R for rock your choice Rock the computer's choice is paper let's try it like two more times okay we chose paper the computer chose Rock let's pick s for scissors your choice scissors the the computer's choice is also scissors okay so the computer is picking a random Choice that's good now we'll have to decide who won at the end of our program we will invoke the choose winner function pass in our player as well as the computer then within the choose winner function let's create another switch we will examine our player against matching cases if our player chooses Rock the character R I think the best way to do this would be to use if statements within each case if the player chooses Rock and if the computer chooses R for rock that means there's a tie I'll display that standard output it's a tie then I'll add a new line else if the computer chooses paper that means we lose standard output you [Music] lose else well there's only one option left Scissors because if the computer didn't choose rock or paper that means they pick scissors rock beats scissors so let's display that the user one you win oh then be sure to to add a break at the end to break out of the switch this is the case if the player chooses Rock Let's copy all of this code paste it and let's move this over now if the user chooses paper we have some different results paper BS Rock will change this line of output to be you win if the user chooses paper and the computer chooses paper that means means it's a tie it's a tie if we choose paper and the computer chooses scissors that means we lose you lose one more case if the player picks scissors and the computer picks rock you lose scissors beads paper you win else scissors ties with scissors it's a tie and that is everything so let's close this function and run this program okay I'll pick R for rock we picked Rock the computer picked scissors you win P for paper the computer also picked paper it's a tie I'll pick scissors I picked scissors the computer picked rock you lose well all right then everybody that is a game of rock paper scissors if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a game of rock paper scissors in C++ we have a big topic today I need to discuss arrays an array is a data structure that can hold multiple values values are accessed by an index number think of an array as kind of like a variable that holds multiple values it's a little more complicated than that but that's a good way of thinking about them perhaps we have the name of a car this will be a standard string I will name this car assign this a value of whatever car that you like one car that I like is a Corvette then I will display whatever our car is standard output car so of course this car is a Corvette we can transform this variable into an array by making the following changes after the variable name add a set of square brackets then enclose your values with a set of curly braces there we now have an array my variable car is now an array now this variable can hold multiple values multiple cars kind of like it's a parking garage separate each value with a comma this time I'll add a Mustang then a Camry now take a look at this I will display car now what the heck is this so this is a memory address of where our array is located like 123 Fake Street if I need one of these elements one of these values that's found within the array in order to access it I have to do so by an index number after the array name I will add a set of square brackets then an index number the first element in an array has an index of zero because computers always start with zero and we have our Corvette it's kind of like a parking spot number that's why I went with this example of cars if I need the next element within my array I would access element number one then I should probably add a new line just to separate these new line we have our Corvette and our Mustang then we have our third element which would have an index of two so we have our three elements our Corvette our Mustang and our Camry you can reassign values too I'm going to change the first element within this array take the array name select an index number I'll set this equal to a Camaro a Chevy Camaro now at parking spot number zero we have our Camaro then our Mustang than our Camry I'm going to rename car as cars just so people know that it's plural although it's not necessary one thing with the Rays is that they can only contain values of the same data type like I'll try and stick a number within here number one so our compiler doesn't like it that there's a number in here with all these strings so arrays should all be of the same data type now if you don't know what you want to place within an array you can simply declare an array then assign values later I'm going to declare an array of cars and then later assign some values cars at index one will have our Mustang cars at index 2 will be our Camry see we still have an error though array size missing in cars you can declare an array then assign values later we need to set a size to this array it's a static data structure if I'm only going to place three cars within this array I'll set the size to be three So within the square brackets you can set an array size and this would work the same you can declare an array be sure to set the size and then assign values later let's try one last example I'm going to create an array of prices these will be of the double data type prices add a set of square brackets I'll go ahead and assign these values right away so I don't need to declare a size explicitly make up some prices $5 $7.50 $9.99 then $15 I'll display these prices standard output prices I'll list an index number of what element I'm trying to access the first would be zero then I'll add a new line let's copy this line of code and paste it a couple more times we have prices at index zero that is the first element then one 2 and three and here are the prices so yeah that's an array think of it as a variable that can hold multiple values it's a little more complicated than that it's a type of data structure but that's a good way of thinking about them to change a variable into an array after the variable name add a set of square brackets place your values within a set of curly braces that's if you're assigning values right away or otherwise you can set a size and then assign values later that's another option so yeah those are arrays your assignment is to post an array in the comment section down below and well yeah those are arrays in C++ you guys ready all right let's talk about the size of operator the size of operator determines the size in bytes of a variable data type class objects Etc whatever you would like to find the size of you stick within the parentheses of the size of operator here's an example let's create a double double GPA our GPA will be a solid 2.5 to determine the size in bytes of my variable or a data type I will just place within the set of parentheses I'll display this standard output size of operator I would like to return the size of my GPA variable then I'll just add a string byes new line let's take a look the size of my GPA variable is 8 bytes that's the maximum size allocated to my double variable if I was to replace GPA with a data type such as double well this would be the same 8 bytes this will be helpful in the future when we begin working with the so let's try a couple other variables I'll create a string standard string name assign some name then I will find the size of the string size of name the size of a string is 32 bytes because a string really just holds an address to where some text is located the address of where the string of text is located is 32 bytes even if I were to change the size of the string bro code is is awesome well this size is still going to be the same 32 bytes because a string is a reference data type let's try a couple other examples how about a character Char grade my grade will be an F I will find the size of this character grade the size of a character is one bite let's try a Boolean Boolean student is somebody a student true or or false I'll Place student within the size of operator a Boolean variable also takes one bite of memory this time let's find the size of an array in byes I'll create an array of characters Char grades this will be an array I'll set this equal to some grades a b c d then F I'll place my array within the size of operator the size of this array grades is 5 bytes remember that characters take up one bite of memory an array of five characters would be well five bytes we can use the size of operator to calculate how many elements are within an array if we have the total size of our array we could divide this by the size of one element size of grades at index of zero or otherwise we can find the data type we'll divide the size of my array grades divided by the size of a character so I should have these many elements five elements within my array of grades if I were to add one more grade like an e even though that's not a typical grade well then the total elements within that array would be six elements that's a useful trick to calculate the size of an array how many elements are within that array one more this will be a bonus question I'll create an array of strings I'll name this students we'll enter in some student names such as SpongeBob Patrick then Squidward to calculate how many strings are within this array how many students we have we can find the size of my array students divided by the size of a string I have three elements within this array of students then I could add one more and this equation should calculate that I'll add Sandy size of students divided by the size of a string would give me four elements so yeah that's the size of operator everybody it will return the size in bytes of a a variable data type class objects all sorts of things it will be really helpful when working with arrays because we can determine the size of an array but we'll get some practice with that in the future and well yeah that's the size of operator in C++ all right guys in this video I'm going to show you how we can iterate over the elements of an array suppose we have an array of students these will be strings standard string I'll name this array students set the equal to some student names pick a few SpongeBob Patrick then Squidward suppose I would like to display all these students normally to do that I would type standard output my array followed by an index number so the first student would be SpongeBob which has an index of zero and my first student is SpongeBob if I need to display all of the elements of this array I would have to one by one access each element then I'll just add a new line we have SpongeBob Patrick and Squidward if I need to display all of the elements of an array a better approach would be to use a for Loop I'm going to type for parentheses curly braces we'll need an index in I I'll set this equal to is Zer because the first element in our array has an index of zero I'll continue this as long as I is less than the length of our array currently it's three then increment I by One during each iteration I would like to display each element standard output students now instead of an index number like 0 1 2 whatever I'm going to use my counter variable I students at index of I during the first iteration I will be zero then 1 then two once we reach three we'll stop I'll add a new line this for Loop will print the elements of my array SpongeBob Patrick Squidward there's one issue with this though what if we add another student such as Sandy well this for Loop will stop once I reach is three if we make any adjustments to this array we would have to go into our code and make some changes such as setting this four Loop so that we discontinue when I reaches four this would work but it's not the best solution for our stopping condition in place of just setting I to be less than some number let's calculate how many elements are within this array to do that we can use the size of operator I'll type size of my array this will give me the total size in byes of my array to calculate the number of elements I can divide size of students by the size of the data type string or even an element this will Loop through all of the elements of this array SpongeBob Patrick Squidward Sandy if we change the number of elements well then there's no need to touch this for Loop it will calculate the size automatically see now we just have SpongeBob and Patrick let's create one last example I'll create an array of grades Char grades we have an A B C D then F if I need to iterate over this array of characters I would find the size of my array grades divided by the size of a character the character data type during each iteration I will display grades at index of I our counter and this will display all of the elements of this array so yeah that's how to iterate over an array using a for Loop in the next topic I will explain the for each Loop which has different syntax and well yeah that's how to iterate over an array using a for Loop in C++ all right guys the for each Loop the for each Loop is a loop that that eases the traversal over an iterable data set an array is an example of an iterable data set suppose we're using a standard for Loop and I have this array of strings named students we have SpongeBob Patrick and Squidward using a standard for loop I would need three statements an index a condition then we could increment or decrement our Index this does work but there is another way of writing this using a for each Loop there's less syntax than a typical four Loop but it's less flexible using a for Loop we can go forwards backwards or even skip iterations of something we're iterating over using a 4 each Loop we start at the beginning and go to the end there's less flexibility so let's change this to a 4 each Loop first We'll add the data type of what we're iterating over we're iterating over strings then we'll need a name for the current element that we're on we have an array of students let's name the current element student colon then our iterable data set which would be our array string student colon students during each iteration let's display whatever the current element is which I named student then I'll add a new line and there we go we have our three students then you could change the amount of students if you would like let's add Sandy now we have SpongeBob Patrick Squidward Sandy let's try a different example let's work with grades this time these will be of the int data type int grades equals make up some grades 65 72 81 93 good enough the data type of what we're iterating over is not a string this time it is an INT integers let's name each element simply grade colon the name of my iterable data set which would be my array grades for every grade in grades let's display each grade and here are the grades 65 72 81 93 so that's a 4 each loop it's a loop that eases the traversal over an iterable data set there's less syntax invol D in a 4 each Loop but it's less flexible if you just need to display the elements of an array a 4 each Loop would work perfect so yeah that's a 4 each Loop everybody your assignment is to post a 4 each Loop in the comment section down below and well yeah that's the 4 each Loop in C++ all right everybody so in this video I'm going to show you how we can pass an array to a function suppose we have an array of prices these will be of the double data type double prices straight brackets equals just make up some prices $49.99 $155 $75 $9.99 good enough we'll create a function to find the sum of these prices and print a total let's say double total equals then I'll invoke a get total function which we still need to declare and Define so let's do that now we'll return a double double get total let's list the parameters we need to accept an array of doubles double prices then add a set of square brackets for the parameter now when we pass an array to a function you only need to pass the array name you don't need a set of square brackets then we'll need a function declaration let's do that before the main function then at the end of my program I will display the total standard output pick a currency uh let's pick a dollar sign then I will display the total within the get total function I'm going to declare a separate local instance of a total variable remember that variables can have the same name as long as they're within a different function so we have double total I'm going to iterate over my array using a for Loop normally what we would do is say in I equals 0 I would continue this as long as I is less than then at this point we would calculate the size of the array but technically this isn't going to work and I'll demonstrate why we have the size of our array prices divided by the size of either the data type or one of the elements typically I like to use one of the elements prices at index zero then I will increment our counter by one during each iteration within our for Loop let's assign total equal to Total plus prices at index of I or we could shorten this to Total plus equals prices at index of I at the end of our program we will return whatever the total is now this isn't going to work the way it's written now here's why when we pass an array to a function it KS into what's known as a pointer which we haven't discussed yet but we will in future topics within this function we're not working with an array anymore we're working with a pointer that points to the address of where the array begins this function has no idea how big this array is anymore we can't calculate how many elements are within this array what we could do is that when we invoke this function we can pass in the array as well as the size of the array since this function no longer knows how big the array is we can explicitly let theun function know what the size is so let's calculate what the size is int size equals we can just copy all this code paste it now when we invoke this function I'm going to pass the size as a second argument then we'll need a matching set of parameters in size be sure to add that with your function declaration too if you have one I would like to continue this for loop as long as I is less than size now this should work let's verify that yep and our total is $150 3 in conclusion when you pass an array to a function you only have to pass the array name you don't need a set of square brackets when you do so however when a function receives an array it decays into a pointer and the function no longer knows what the size of the array is so we could pass that as an additional argument to let the function know what the size is which we could then use to you know iterate over the array so that's how to pass an array to a function your assignment is to post a function that accepts an array as an argument in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to pass an array to a function in C++ hey welcome back so in this video I'm going to show you how we can search an array for an element let's create an array of numbers something simple int numbers this will be an array then assign some numbers I'll just assign the numbers 1 through 10 because I'm basic like that there 1 through 10 we'll probably need this later I'm going to calculate the size of the array int size equals size of my array numbers divided by the size of one of the elements I'll just pick the first element we'll need to keep track of an index like what index did we find something that we're searching for INT index I'll declare this variable but we don't need to assign it as well as int my num my num will be the number that we're looking for let's accept some user input we'll create a prompt standard output enter element to search for I'll add a new line cuz I can standard input my num I'm going to create a function that will search an array for us let's define that function outside of the main function this function will return an integer that will be our index the return type is in I'll name this function search array there's a couple par parameters we'll have three parameters an array of integers integer array the size of the array int size then some element that we're searching for INT element then we should probably add a function declaration at the top that's good this function will return an integer the index of the element that we're searching for we will take our index variable set this equal to then I'm going to invoke the search array function that we just declared but we need three matching Arguments for the three parameters that we have set up an array a size and an element we'll pass in our array numbers the size of the array that we already calculated and the element that we're searching for we're searching for my num within the search array function we will iterate from the beginning of the array to the end and see if there's any matches we can do that with the for Loop we'll begin at zero in I equals z that's our index I will continue this as long as I is less than the size of the array that we're passing in as an argument then increment our index by one this would be technically a linear search we'll start at the beginning and check every value until we reach the end so let's check using an if statement within the for Loop if our array we did name this array numbers but remember that you can rename parameters numbers is technically our array if our array that we receive at index of I that's our counter is equal to the element that we're searching for we will return whatever the index is I if we search through this entire array and don't find that element that we're searching for will return1 in programming1 serves as a sentinel value if you see NE 1 that typically means that something wasn't found well return either I or1 then assign it to this index variable within the main function using an if statement we'll check to see what that value is if our index does not equal -1 that means the element that we're searching for is somewhere within our array let's display the index standard output my num is at index whatever the index variable is else standard output my num is not in the array okay let's see if this actually works enter element to search for let's search for one one is at index zero remember that computers always start with zero enter an element to search for let's search for 10 10 is at index 9 enter an element to search for 42069 42069 is not in the array for additional practice let's search through an array of strings such as food we'll create an array of strings I'll rename numbers as Foods then think of some food that you like pizza hamburger hot dog in size equals the size of foods divided by one of the elements of foods let's rename my num as my food that's the food that we're searching for and that will be of the string data type in place of CN when working with strings let's use getline because the user input may contain spaces standard get line standard input my food within the search array function that we created we will pass our array Foods the size can stay the same then pass in my food that's what we're searching for within the if else statements replace my num with my food then we'll need to change the data types of this function we're accepting an array of strings replace int with string do that with your element as well then we need to change the function declaration at the top of our program okay we can now search through an array of strings enter element to search for let's search for pizza pizza is at index zero hamburger hamburger is at index one hot dog hot dog is at index 2 then let's search for something that's not within this array what about sushi Sushi is not in the array yeah everybody that is how to search through an array this would technically be a linear search you begin at the first element of an array check to see if the values are equal if they're not equal you move to the next element until you reach the end and that's basically it if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to search through an array in C++ hey everybody in this topic I'm going to to show you how we can sort an array first I'll explain the logic behind it then we'll write a C++ program to actually handle it we'll use a standard bubble sort it's an easy sorting algorithm to write although there are more efficient sorting algorithms we're still learning so let's stick with a bubble sort so with a bubble sort we begin at index zero the beginning of our array we'll examine the element directly to the right if the element on the left is larger than the element on the right we need to swap these two elements I will take this element move it within some temp storage like a temporary variable take the element on the right move it to the left take whatever is within temp place it within that opening again we take our value examine the element to the right if it's larger we swap them then we would just repeat this until we reach the end so that would be one element we would repeat this process with the rest of the elements now for the next iteration one is not greater than 9 so we leave it alone then we check the next element 9 is greater than two we would swap these two values I'll speed up the footage for that is a quick demonstration of a bubble sort so let's actually write this in code now okay let's create an array this will be an array of integers make up some numbers make sure they're not in order let's let's calculate the size of the array and size equals size of our array divided by the size of one of the elements at the end of our program we will iterate over our array I'll use a for each Loop in element in Array I will display using standard output every element then I think I'll separate each with the space okay and here's our array obviously unsorted so let's change that I'll create a sort function void sort there will be two parameters an integer array int size let's add a function declaration at the top of our program before we print our array let's invoke the sort function that we just created pass in our array as well as the size there we go okay so let's head to our sort function what we'll need to do is iterate over our array once for every element that's within the array we'll need the help of a temporary variable to swap some values then we'll need nested Loops for in I equals z we'll continue this as long as I is less than the size of our array minus one the reason that the condition is size minus one is because we don't need to compare the last element to anything the larger values will naturally gravitate towards the end of the array increment I by one then we'll need a nested for Loop let's use index J because I is already taken now our condition is going to be size - i - one once we place the larger elements all the way to the right they should already be in order we don't need to sort any elements that are already sorted then what we have to do is use an if state statement to check to see if the current element that we're on array at index of J is greater than the element on the right array at index of J + 1 if the element on the left is larger than the element on the right we just have to swap those two values we'll take temp which we declared up here equals array at index of J array array at index of J equals array at index of J + 1 then lastly array at index of J + 1 equals whatever is within Temp and that should be it let's run this yeah and our array is now sorted in ascending order so if you need descending order within this if statement use less than and now this array is in descending order well okay then everybody that's one way in which you can sort an array we used what's known as a bubble sort it's easy to write but it's not as efficient as some other algorithms that are out there this is a good one for beginners if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to sort an array using C++ hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain the fill function The Fill function fills a range of elements with with a specified value there's three arguments a beginning address of a data structure an ending address then some value suppose we have an array of strings standard string I'll name this array Foods I'll give this a maximum size of 10 elements then I'll go ahead and fill this array with the same food I'll fill all 10 elements with the word pizza so that's one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so these all have the same value now this really isn't practical although it does work just to demonstrate I'll display the elements with the for each loop we're displaying strings for every food element in my array Foods I would like to display each food element then I'll add a new line so we have 10 elements all filled with pizza you know this does work but it's not practical to initialize all of these elements manually what if we had an array of 100 elements I would have to type the word Pizza 100 times there's a few Solutions one of which would be the fill function which would make this process a lot easier I'm going to declare this array but not fill it in quite yet we have an array of 100 elements to store strings I'm going to fill all 100 elements with pizza so we type fill parentheses now we need the beginning address of a data structure well that's simply the array name then an ending address so that would be the second argument we would type the array name plus the size of the array so plus 100 in this case then some value I'll fill this array with the word Pizza 100 times there we go all 100 elements have been filled with pizza now if you do change the size of this array let's say we have 150 elements you would have to go and change that within the fill method too what I would do in place of adding some number to my array I will add a size variable foods will be index of size and then we can set some size actually better yet let's make this a constant constant int size then I'll set this to be 100 Foods plus size so again all 100 elements are filled with pizza now here's a few exercises if I'm filling the first half of this array with pizza we have our beginning address then I need to find the halfway point Foods plus size / two I'll just go ahead and put that within some parentheses for clarity then if I were to run this the first half of this array contains pizza and the second half contains nothing it's empty to fill the second half of this array with hamburgers I would invoke The Fill function again we will begin where we left off Foods plus size / two the ending address would be Foods plus size we will fill the second half of this array with hamburgers there we are the first half is all Pizza the second half is all hamburgers here's a challenge round we'll fill the first third of our array with pizza the second third will be hamburgers and the last third will be hot dogs but 100 doesn't divide by three evenly just to make this simple I'll set our array to be 99 elements we're filling the first third of our array with pizza size divided 3 hamburgers will begin at Foods plus size ID 3 and end at size / 3 * 2 then we'll invoke The Fill function one more time we'll continue where we left off and we will end at Foods plus size and fill this with hot dogs here we go so we have pizza hamburgers then hot dogs so yeah that is the fill function we can fill a range of elements with a specified value it's great if you have a lot of elements to work with and you don't manually want to type all the values if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's the The Fill function in C++ hey welcome back everybody in this video I'm going to explain one of a few ways in which we can accept user input and place it within an array there's no one- siiz fits-all way to do it I'll show you one way that's good for beginners let's begin by creating an array I'll create an array of strings named Foods we're not going to be assigning values to this array quite yet that's where the user input will come in if we're not assigning values right away when we initialize this array we'll have to specify a size for the time being let's say five something small now arrays they're static data structures while our program is running we can't change the size of this array the max size is stuck at five and that might be a problem if we would like to enter in more than five items we'll discuss dynamic memory in a future video then I'm going to calculate the size of this array in size equals size of my array Foods divide by the size of one of the elements Foods at index of zero let's create a for Loop to iterate over the elements of this array for in I equals 0 we'll continue this as long as I is less than the size of our array then increment I by One let's create a prompt standard output enter a food would you like then I'll display the number to show the user what number we're on I then I'm just going to add a colon at the end if we're working with strings we should probably use the getline function just because what the user enters may contain spaces get line standard input we'll place our input within our array Foods at the index of I whatever we're currently on our counter at the end of our program let's display a message you like the following food I'll use a for each Loop to iterate over the elements of this array we list the data type a name for the current element food in foods let's display standard output whatever the food is I'll add a new line and that should be good now take a look at this enter a food you like we're on number zero I'm going to add plus one to I when we display our prompt the user is not going to be sure why there's a number zero but we know that's the beginning index of an array so I'm just going to change that here enter a food you like we're on number one pizza hamburger hot dog Ramen Sushi and these are the five elements you like the following food pizza hamburger hot dog Ramen Sushi okay that's pretty good so far suppose the user only wants to enter in three elements not all five we should add some way to escape out of this for Loop based on some user input I'm going to add this line enter a food you like or Q to quit now check this out if the user types in Q we would like to exit if Foods at index of I is equal to the string Q then I would like to break out of this for Loop the user is done entering an input but there's a problem with this enter a food you like or CU to quit number one pizza hamburger hot dog now I'm going to press Q to quit we don't have any more prompts to enter in food we went to the results you like the following food pizza hamburger hot dog Q I'd rather not put the letter Q in my Foods array I'm going to create a temporary variable just to hold some user input this will be of the string data type standard string I'll name this temp meaning temporary it's a a temporary variable in place of directly putting my user input into my Foods array I'll place it temporarily within my variable temp I'm going to check if temp is equal to Q else will take Foods at index of I set the SQL to Temp that way we're not directly assigning our user input to our array until we check what it is if the user types in Q to quit we don't want to put that within our Foods array so let's try this again it should be better enter a food you like or C to quit Pizza hamburger hot dog Q to quit Okay Pizza hamburger hot dog well the letter Q isn't here but when we display what's within the array we have these empty spaces we did not assign a value to these if one of our elements is empty I don't want to display it so we can make this following change in place of for each Loop let's use a standard for Loop in I equals 0 now here's the condition we're used to saying I is less than size right I'd like to propose a change we'll write a different condition I will check if the current element is empty Foods at index of I dot empty function then we'll add the not logical operator we'll continue our for loop as long as theur current element is not empty then we'll add the statement increment I by one we'll display our array Foods at index of I this for Loop shouldn't display any elements that are empty Pizza hamburger hot dog Q to quit yeah and we only have three elements Pizza hamburger hot dog one disadvantage of arrays is that they have a limited size they're static once we declare a size we can't change it we're limmited to only storing five foods you could declare a larger size but you may be wasting memory if a user doesn't want to type in all 10 so in future topics we'll need to discuss both dynamic memory and vectors which should be coming up sometime in the future so yeah that is one way out of many ways to enter in user input into an array if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to enter user input into an array using C++ hey everybody in this topic I'm going to explain multi-dimensional arrays more specifically 2D arrays it's an array made up of separate arrays they're useful because they can represent a grid or Matrix of data with rows and columns here's an example I'll create a two-dimensional array of cars car names the data type will be string I will name this array cars with arrays they have one set of square brackets but if you're creating a two-dimensional array you need two sets of square brackets the first set of square brackets is for the number of rows let's say three in this example the second set of square brackets corresponds to the number of columns if we have three rows and four columns 3 * 4 is 12 so that would give us 12 elements if you're initializing your 2D array right away you don't necessarily need to set a row size but you do need a column size I'll just set the amount of columns to be three just something small okay so let's fill in the first array this first row will be cars manufactured by Ford I'll add a Mustang then a Ford Escape then maybe a Ford F150 okay this is our first array I'm going to create a second array after the first array I'll add comma what I like to do I like to organize my 2D array kind of like it's a grid so now we have a second array this next array will be cars manufactured by Chevrolet I'll pick a Corvette then an equinox and a Silverado let's add one last array these will be cars manufactured by Dodge Challenger Durango Ram 1500 all right now to finish this two-dimensional array we will enclose all of these inner arrays with another set of curly braces then add a semicolon to the end that is our two-dimensional array you can see that there's rows and columns in this example each row corresponds to a manufacturer so it's kind of like a grid a matrix then if you were to access one of these elements you need two indices just to demonstrate let's display all of them standard output cars I need to select the row number then the column number row zero column zero let's see what C that is I'm just going to add a space between these elements okay row zero column zero that's my Mustang row 0 column 0 that's Mustang let's print the next element that would be row0 column one that is my Ford Escape row zero column 1 I'm just going to zoom out there then we have row zero column 2 that's the Ford F-150 I'm going to display a new line character now we are on Row one so let's copy these paste them Row one column zero Row one column 1 Row one column two so this next row is our cars manufactured by Chevrolet we have our Corvette our Equinox then our Silverado then we will display row two row two column zero row two column 1 row row two column 2 and these are the cars manufactured by Dodge we have our Challenger Durango Ram 1500 so yeah you can see that a two-dimensional array is kind of like a grid made up of rows and columns now if we need to iterate over a two-dimensional array and display the elements here's one way in which we can do that we can use nested Loops but just to make it easy I'm going to calculate the amount of rows and columns that we have let's begin with the rows if rows equals size of my array cars divided by the size of one of the elements cars at index Zer is good then to calculate the amount of columns that we have we could do something like this int columns equals the size of cars at index of zero divided by the size of one of the elements so remember there's two indices this time 0 Z is good in this example we should have three rows as well as three columns now let's create a for Loop to iterate over the rows in I equals z i will continue this as long as I is less than the number of rows that we have then increment I by one I'm going to display cars at index of I just for the time being then for now I'm just going to add a new line between each so if I was to display cars at index I that should give us three memory addresses one address for every inner array this memory address is for the first array then the second array then the third array what I need to do now to get the elements within each array is to create an inner loop let's use an in four Loop to iterate over each element within each array int J because I is already taken set this equal to zero we will continue this for loop as long as J is less then the number of columns that we have increment J by one now I'm going to display cars and there's two indices I then J I'm going to display a space between each of these okay now we have one long line of text so once we escape the inner for loop I would just like to print a new line I'll add standard output new line character okay and here's our two-dimensional array the first row are for cars Manu factured by Ford then Chevrolet then Dodge that's how to iterate over a two-dimensional array you have the outer loop that's in charge of the rows the inner loop which is in charge of the columns so that's a two-dimensional array everybody it's just an array where each element is its own separate array you have two indices the first for the rows the second for the columns to access one of the elements you have to specify the row then the column that element is found so those are two-dimensional arrays your assignment is to post a two-dimensional array in the comment section down below and well yeah those are two dimensional arrays in C++ hey everybody in this video we're going to create a quiz game using C++ let's begin by creating an array of questions these will be of the string data type I will name this array questions and then let's think of some questions really add any questions that you want here's a few that come to mind for me what year was C++ created okay that is the first question I'll add an additional string question two who invented C++ third question what is the predecessor of C++ and I couldn't think of a fourth question so I'm going to ask is the earth flat good enough with each question there will be four corresponding options I think a two-dimensional array would be perfect for this this will be a two-dimensional array of strings named options we'll need to set the number of columns four columns is good this first array will be for the options for the first question a will be 1969 B 1975 C 1985 1985 is the correct answer d 1989 now we have our next array who invented C++ gido van rossom he's the creator of python so that's not the correct answer bearn stro strip I'm sorry if I mispronounce your name dude hopefully you're not watching right now B is the correct answer in this case C John karmac D Mark Zuckerberg we're on question three what is the predecessor of C++ the correct answer is C that would be option A C+ C minus minus or b++ okay last question is the earth flat yes no sometimes what's Earth all right then I just need to surround all of these arrays with another set of curly braces and there is our two-dimensional array named options to hold all of the options for our questions we'll need to create an answer key next this will be an array of characters answer key array equals here are the correct answers C B A then B 1985 bejn strup C the language see that is and no the Earth is not flat I looked it up on Wikipedia just now let's calculate the size of our questions how many questions do we have in size equals the size of our array questions divided by the size of one of the elements questions at index0 we'll create a character to hold our guess int score to hold the score now we'll need to iterate over our questions for let me move down here in I equals z we'll continue this as long as I is less than the size of our array the size of questions this would effectively be the amount of questions that we have then I'm going to increment I by one we will iterate once through all of the questions we have standard output let's access the string that's within question questions at index I I'll add a new line just for some text decoration I'm going to add a bunch of asterisks before and after the question so let's get rid of this I think that'll look pretty cool there we go then we'll need to iterate over our 2D array we'll use an in four Loop for that we'll need a different index I is already taken let's pick J in J equals z we'll continue this as long as J is less than now we'll need to calculate how many elements are within each array so we can do that with size of our options array at index of I divided by the size of options and there's two indices here I then zero then we will increment J by one we will display our options standard output options there's two indices I then J I'll add a new line so if I were to run this this should display all of the questions and all of the options yeah here we are what year was C++ created who invented C++ what is the predecessor of C++ is the earth flat after all of the options are laid out we will accept some user input standard input we will place the user's input within guess then just in case the user types in something that's lowercase like a lowercase C we're looking for Capital C so let's take the user's guess then make it uppercase guess equals two upper pass in guess so that will capitalize the character the user enters in then let's check to see if the user's guess is equal to the answer we'll need to access the answer key at index of I that's the current numbered question if those two values are the same we will display correct I'll add a new line then increment the user score score Plus+ else the user's guess is not correct standard output wrong then we will display the correct answer standard output answer colon space we'll access the answer key at index of I then I'll add a new line okay let's drive this so far what year was C++ created C who invented C++ that would be B what is the predecessor of C++ that is C the language C but it's option A is the earth flat what's Earth D okay wrong answer B okay so we know that we can cycle through the questions outside of the for Loop we will calculate the player score so right here I'll display the word results standard output results I'll add a new line actually now that I think of it I'm going to steal some of these text decorations let's make it look pretty something like this would look cool but not necessary standard output correct guesses then we will display the current score add a new line standard output number of questions that is simply the size of our array add a new line then we will calculate a percentage what percent of the questions did they get right score score divided by size times 100 then we'll add percent so at first this isn't going to work because we're using integer division but I'll explain that momentarily about type casting uh so let's run this once let's say A B C D correct guesses one number of questions four uh our score was 0% even though we got one ready all right we'll need to add a cast to the diviser let's cast size as a double to hold that decimal portion then this should work A B C D correct guesses one number of questions four our score was 25% now let's go for 100 remember that the correct answers are CB a b 1985 bejn strp the language C but that's option A is the earth flat no B correct guesses four number of questions four score 100% well yeah everybody that is a quiz game you can make in C++ you can impress your friends or have your friends take the quiz you know you can change your questions around if you want if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and that is a quiz game written using C++ hey everybody Welcome to the exciting world of memory addresses a memory address is a location in memory where data is stored in C++ a memory address can be accessed with an Amper sand known as the address of operator suppose we have some varibles I'll create a string the variable name will be well name assign this a string of text I'll create int age set equal to some value then a Boolean Boolean student I'll set that to be true a variable is a container for some data but these variables need to exist somewhere well they exist in your computer's memory at a given address we can find that address with the address of operator I'll display that standard output I would like to display the address of name then I'll just add a new line here's the address of my name variable in my computer's memory it's a bunch of weird letters and numbers well this is a hexadecimal address every time we run this program that number is likely to change let's display the addresses of agent student address of age address of student here are the memory addresses again all in heximal so these are kind of like street address es hey for fun let's decode these to decimal you can easily find tools online to convert heximal to decimal let's see what these numbers are here are the heximal memory addresses but converted to decimal they're like house numbers different data types take up more or less room than other data types if we look at the distance between my name variable and age well that has a gap of four memory addresses but the gap between my age and student variables is only one because well booleans only take up one bite of memory that's one of the reasons we use data types we need to know how much memory we need to allocate to fit a certain value if we're working with a Boolean variable well we only need one bite of memory that's why the distance between the memory address of age and student is only 1 40 - 39 is 1 integers take up four bytes of memory 44 4 - 40 is 4 4 bytes so that's an introduction to memory addresses it's going to be helpful in the next topic when we discuss pointers if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and that is an introduction to memory addresses in C++ all right everybody so I'm going to explain the differences between pass by value and pass by reference in this example we'll swap two variables suppose we have two imaginary cups I'll name the first cup x x will contain Kool-Aid then we have cup Y which contains water I need to swap these two values we'll need the help of a temporary variable string temp to swap two variables we would assign temp = to x x = y y = temp let's display these variables standard output X the variable X I'll add a new line let's copy this paste it y the variable y this should work X now contains water y contains Kool-Aid now check this out what if we create a function to swap two variables for us the return type will be void I'll name this function swap there will be two parameters string X string y let's copy this section of code delete it then paste it within the swap function then you'll need a function declaration at the top of your program then we will invoke this function swap pass our arguments X and Y let's see what happens okay what the heck X still contains Kool-Aid y still contains water these values weren't switched within my variables X and Y even though we invoked this function so why didn't it work well that's because normally when we pass a variable to a function we're passing by value when we invoke this function we're creating copies of the original values what we have now are two copies of the variable X X and Y and all we're doing is switching the two copies and not the original values so that's pass by value we're creating copies of the arguments if I need to change the original values of these variables I could instead pass by reference a reference as in a memory address an address in your computer's memory where a value is located I will prefix the address of operator which is an ampersand to these parameter names then add that to your function declaration as well now let's see what happens yeah those two variables were switched X contains water y contains Kool-Aid when we passed by value we created copies of X and Y with the parameters when we use the address of operator we're passing memory addresses to where the original X and Y variables are located and then swapping the values just to reinforce this idea let's revert to passing by value I'm going to display the address of X and Y then within our SW op function let's get rid of this code then I will also display the addresses of X and Y see we have four different addresses our original X variable has a different memory address than the one that's within the function same thing goes with Y these two addresses are different we have two x variables and two y variables originally within that swap function we were switching the values of the X and Y copies if we instead pass by reference let's use that address of operator again well now X and Y are referring to the same place they have the same memory addresses that's why the swap function worked when we passed by reference in place of pass by value so that's the main difference between pass by value and pass by reference you should use pass by reference as often as possible unless you have a reason to pass by value if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's the main difference between pass by value and pass by reference in C++ hey everyone in this topic I'm going to explain const parameters a const parameter is a parameter that is modified with a const keyword that makes it effectively readon there's a couple reasons why you might want to declare a const parameter your code is more secure within a function and it conveys the intent to other programmers it's especially useful for references and pointers here's an example of const parameter an action I have standard string name assign your first name then in age whatever your age is then suppose I have a function to print my info void print info and there will be two parameters standard string name int age be sure to add a function declaration if you're missing it then if I need to call this function I would invoke the function name pass in my arguments name age then we can print our info standard output name standard output age this of course does what you expect it prints our name and our age to make this function more secure we can instead use con parameters that means that we can't change the values that we receive name and age in this case just as a test let's set name equal to an empty space and age equals z I don't want this to be able to happen at all now when I run this we don't have a name and we don't have an age to make these parameters readon we can precede the parameters with that const keyword const string name const int age and you would probably want to add that to your function declaration as well just to display intent there we have an error assignment of readon parameter age and name is somewhere up here but I don't feel like reading all that when we pass our string and our integer as arguments what we're doing is effectively making a copy of name and age technically we're not modifying the original variables in this case using the const keyword when we pass a variable by value isn't really that big of a deal but it at least conveys intent if we were working with reference data types now we'll pass by reference well now it's a bigger deal we don't want anybody modifying the original name and age variables all right everybody those are const parameters they are parameters Modified by the con keyword that effectively make them read only within a function your code is more secure and it conveys intent it tells other programmers hey don't mess with these values they're useful with references so that no nobody can change the value found at that reference then in the case of pointers nobody can change the address of where a pointer is pointing to so yeah those are const parameters in C++ hey everybody in this topic we're going to create a program to validate if a credit card number is valid or not to do so we'll need to utilize The Loon algorithm which I've broken into these steps if you need some test credit card numbers you can always Google them I found a bunch on this website let's just take this one for example and to make this more readable I'll divide this number into groups of four step one we double every second digit from right to left if the double number is two digits split them I'm only concerned with every second digit from right to left so we can eliminate some of these that we won't be using then we're going to double these numbers so two doubled is four 9 doubled is 18 since we have the number 18 that's two digits we need to split them we'll split 18 to one and 8 then six doubled is 12 we'll split that step two we need to add all of these numbers together to create a sum the sum is 29 step three add all odd number digits from right to left with the original number so now we're only concerned with the odd numbers then we just add these numbers together no need to double them the sum is 21 step four we sum the results of steps two and steps three 29 9 + 21 that equals 50 step five if step four is divisible by 10 that number is valid we could say our result modulus 10 if that number is divisible by zero that number is valid 50 is divisible by 10 so that number is valid we'll create a program that will do all of this for us let's create our functions we'll need three int get digit the parameter will be a constant integer that I will name number int we'll need to sum the odd digits the parameter is const standard string card number let's copy this paste it sum even digits the parameter is the same let's copy these functions and add some declarations we do need to return something otherwise we'll get a warning for the time being I'm just going to return zero as a placeholder okay let's begin with the main function we'll need a credit card number that will be a string standard string card number then int result and I will set that equal to zero right away okay we'll prompt the user to enter in their credit card number standard output enter a credit card number standard input card number result equals will invoke the sum even digits function pass in our card number plus some odd digits pass in our card number we'll need to fill in these functions let's begin with some even digits we can get rid of this I'll create a local variable named sum to keep track of the sum what we'll need to do is iterate over our card number in reverse order we can treat a string as an array of characters and we can iterate over that so we'll need a for Loop and we will iterate over this card number in reverse order starting from the end we'll need an index in I equals then we'll need to find the size of our card number there's a built-in function for that card number do size now arrays they always start with zero so we're going to subtract one however if we're summing the even digits beginning from the right we'll need the second to last digit so that would actually be -2 the very last digit would be minus1 our index I will begin from the second to last position I would like to continue this for loop as long as I is less than or equal to zero then we will decrement I by 2 i - = 2 because we need every even digit so we will take sum plus equals then invoke the get digit function get digit within the get digit function as an argument we're going to pass in card number at index of itimes 2 however there's one more thing that we'll need to do with card number at index of I we will subtract the character Zero and here's why we're currently working with a string of characters you can also treat a string as an array of characters each character according to the aski table has an Associated integer value a decimal value if I'm passing one of these characters as an argument to my get digit function we'll treat that character as if it was its decimal equivalent according to the asky table the character Zero has a decimal value of 48 the character 1 is 49 2 is 50 then all the way up to 9 which has a decimal value of 57 so if I'm passing in the character at index of I what we'll end up working with is the decimal representation of that character if we subtract the character Zero or its equivalent 48 that would give us a range of numbers 0 through 9 for example the decimal equivalent of the character 9 is 57 57 minus 48 would be 9 you could subtract either 48 or the character Zero that would give us numbers 0 through 9 according to the asky table then we're multiplying that number by two then at the end we will return whatever the sum is let's fill in this get digit function within the get digit function the digit that we're working with was doubled whatever number we passed in it may take two digits for example like 9 * 2 is 18 we need to split those two numbers to get 1 and8 so I'm going to return number modulus 10 plus number ID 10 modulus 10 that will split the two numbers for example let's say our number that we're passing in as an argument is 18 9 * 2 18 modulus 10 would give us 8 18 / 10 that would give us 1 since we're using integer Division 1 modulus 10 is 1 8 + 1 is 9 then we're just returning that number nine okay that is the get digit function then we need to sum the odd digits and really we could just copy all this then paste it but there's a couple changes to make in I equals card number. size function minus one we need to begin at the end and then sum plus equals card number minus 0 when summing the odd digits there's no need to double the odd digits that's only with the even digits and that is all the functions let's close out of these so we'll have a result the sum of the even digits plus the sum of the odd digits if result is divisible by 10 that number is valid if result modulus 10 is equal to zero then that number is valid standard output card number is valid else card number is not valid okay let's try this I'm going to enter in that original number that we worked with that Discover card okay enter a credit card number I'm going to paste this hit enter that number is valid let's try that again so I'm going to enter in the same card number except I'll add one to the end that number is not valid hey if you have your own credit cards feel free to try them too and see if it works all right everybody that is a credit card validation program most for practice if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below please be sure that you do not enter in your own credit card into the comment section and well yeah that is a credit card validation program using C++ all right everybody we finally made it to pointers a pointer is just a variable that stores a memory address of another variable that's it the reason that we use pointers is because well sometimes it's just easier to work with an address here's an example I have a stack of maybe 20 pizzas that I'm going to give out for free to my neighborhood instead of going around house to house carrying the free pizza and handing it out it's a lot easier to go door too and tell people where the pizza is located hey there's free pizza at my house at this address come and get some and that's one of the uses of pointers sometimes it's easier to just work with an address I'll tell people where the free pizza is rather than carry it around with me so when working with pointers need to use the address of operator which is an ampersand as well as the D reference operator which is an asterisk let's begin with the name I'll create a pointer Twi a name standard string name assign your first name then we'll create a pointer to name where is my name located in my computer's memory to create a pointer it should be of the same data type as the variable it's pointing to I'm creating a pointer to a string this pointer will be a of the string data type then type asterisk that D reference operator then a common naming convention for pointers is you type P then the variable name but I'm going to make the first letter uppercase I will set this pointer equal to the address of that name variable and there we go we have a pointer so if I was to display this pointer standard output P name my pointer contains this value it contains a memory address as its value to access the value at this address you would use the dfference operator I'm accessing the value of that address that's stored within this pointer which contains my first name by using this D reference operator I'm accessing the value that's at this given address which contains my first name let's create a couple other pointers let's create a variable age int age equals make up some age I'll create a pointer to age the data type of the pointer should be the same as the variable int D reference operator P age equals the address of age then let's display whatever value is is located at the address that's stored within my pointer of pH so we have my first name and then an age I think I'm just going to add a new line real quick going back to that analogy with the free pizzas I'll create an array an array of strings I'll name this array free pizzas I'll give this a size of five we have pizza 1 Pizza 2 Pizza 3 Pizza 4 then Pizza 5 like I said in my example it's a lot easier instead of carrying around five free pizzas house to house giving away Pizza I can just tell people where the pizza is located I'll give them an address I'll create a pointer to this array we'll use the same data type we're storing strings D reference operator P free pizzas now I'm going to attempt to set this to the address of free pizzas now we're going to run into a problem my array is already an address so I don't need to use the address of Operator Let Me demonstrate I will display see out free pizzas when accessing my array free pizzas it's already a memory address if I display the value contained within my pointer to my free pizzas it's going to be a memory address then if I was to use the dfference operator that would give me the first element within that array Pizza one so those are Pointers it's a variable that stores a memory address of another variable sometimes it's easier to work with an address instead of carrying five free pizzas with me and going house to house giving it away I'll just tell people where the free pizza is so those are Pointers your assignment is to post a pointer in the comment section down below and well yeah that's an introduction to pointers in C++ hey what's up everybody so let's talk about null pointers but first we'll need to know what a null value is a null value is a special value that means that something has no value when a pointer is holding a null value that means that pointer is not pointing to anything that's what we would call a null pointer there is a keyword that represents that null PTR PTR meaning pointer it's a keyword that represents a null pointer literal one of the reasons that we use null pointer is that they're helpful when determining if an address was successfully assigned to a pointer if we create a pointer but don't assign it a value we don't know where it's pointing to it would be good practice that that pointer doesn't Point anywhere so let's create a null pointer I'll create a pointer of the int data type we use the D reference operator pointer if I'm not going to assign this pointer and address right away it would be good practice to assign this pointer null PTR null pointer later on in your program if you need to assign an address let's say int x = 1 23 I would just take my pointer set this equal to the address of my variable if you dfference a null pointer it can lead to undefined Behavior or if you dreference a pointer that's not assigned a value well that can lead to undefined Behavior too what some programmers do is that they'll check to see if their pointer is a pointer before continuing kind of like a system of checks and balances we assigned our pointer the address of X I would like to check to see if my pointer contains a valid address before dereferencing it so we could say pointer equals null pointer was my pointer assigned an address or is it still a null pointer if my pointer is still a null pointer that means we did not successfully assign an address to my pointer there may be situations such as when working with dynamic memory where you attempt to assign an address to your pointer and it fails this would be a good way to check to see if that failed or not if your pointer Still Remains a n pointer so let's say address was not assigned else standard output address was assigned so let's run this currently our pointer is pointing to the address of X address was assigned now if for some reason we did not assign an address I'll turn this line into a comment to represent that well our pointer is still going to be a null pointer address was not assigned if your pointer is still a null pointer it's not safe to dereference that pointer if I need access to the value that's at that pointer it would be safe to do so within this else statement standard output the reference operator pointer so my pointer contains the number 1 123 if I were to dreference this null pointer that would lead to undefined Behavior I have no idea what's going to happen don't try this at home kids what the a null pointer is a keyword that represents a null pointer literal when declaring a pointer it's good practice that our pointer is pointing to a valid address or this null pointer keyword because otherwise we don't know where it's pointing originally they're helpful when determining if an address was successfully assigned to a pointer when using pointers be careful that your code isn't dereferencing a null pointer or pointing to any free memory that we're not using cuz that can lead to undefined Behavior so yeah everybody those are n pointers in C++ hey guys in this topic we're going to create a game of tic taac toe we'll be working with random numbers you may or may not need to include this header file include C time we'll add some function declarations then some definitions void draw board there will be one parameter a pointer tun array named spaces spaces will be a one-dimensional array that will keep track of all the markers like what spots are taken what spots are occupied Player move the parameters will be a pointer to spaces and Char player computer move a pointer to spaces char computer check winner a pointer to spaces Char player and Char computer then lastly check tie and all we need is a pointer to our array spaces oh uh check winner and check tie will both return a Boolean value okay let's add some fun declarations so after the main function let's paste these we do need to return some value for check winner and check TI because there is a return type just for now as a placeholder I'm going to return zero but we'll change that later let's head to the main function and declare everything that we'll need a character array named space spes the size will be nine nine spaces we'll have nine elements each contains an empty space one two three four five six seven eight nine good Char player pick a character that you'd like to be you could do X or something something else Char computer pick a character for the computer let's begin with o Boolean running I'll set this equal to True when we begin our game we will immediately invoke the draw board function then pass in our array so remember when we pass an array to a function it decays into a pointer so we don't need to create a pointer for this array within the drawboard function we will display a grid so let's write something like this standard output I'll add five spaces 1 two 3 4 five then a vertical bar five spaces again 1 2 3 4 5 vertical bar 1 2 3 4 five then a new line okay let's copy this line right in the middle I'm going to add one of the elements of our array spaces so right about there spaces at index zero I'm going to copy this section of code right in the middle between the two vertical bars I'll paste what we copied spaces at index one then again right in the middle paste what you have spaces at index 2 this time we'll create a horizontal bar let's copy this we'll replace the spaces with underscores so right about there okay let's see what we have okay yeah something like this we'll have a player or the computer right in the center so let's copy this line on top paste it underneath copy this line that displays elements of our array paste it underneath but change the element to numbers 3 4 five and we'll copy this line paste it underneath let's double check to see what we have okay we're getting somewhere let's copy this line paste it copy one of these lines where we display the elements of the array paste it underneath so we are missing elements six 7 8 let's copy one of these empty lines paste it underneath then before and after we display this grid I'll just display a new line standard output new line and let's do that after okay let's see what we have yeah not too bad there's our grid of nine spaces okay that is the draw board function we can close out of this we're done with that when we invoke the draw a board function we will pass in our array which decays to a pointer and then prints our board let's add a while loop after the draw board function while our condition is running running is set to True initially when we exit out of the game we'll set running to be false the first thing that we'll do is invoke the player move function Player move but we need to pass in our array spaces as well as a player player then let's fill in the player move function okay player move move I'll create a local variable named number the user will enter in a number between 1 and 9 depending on what space they'd like to occupy with their marker I'll create a do while loop do while the condition will be not number is greater than zero or not number is less than 8 the user can only enter in a number between 0 and 8 those numbers correspond to the elements of our array elements with indices 0 through 8 within the do while loop we'll ask for some user input standard output enter a spot to place a marker 1 through n whatever the user types in we'll just subtract one because the user doesn't know that arrays start with zero supposedly standard input number so the user will enter in a number between 1 and N then we will decrement the number by one because the array starts with zero if spaces at index of number whatever the user types in is equal to an empty space if that space isn't occupied We'll add that marker to that spot spaces at index of number equals the players marker then we like to break out of this while loop so after the player moves let's draw the board again to reflect any changes okay enter a spot to place a marker how about one yeah and there's our marker let's try it again how about nine yep and we are in the last spot the bottom right Corner let's enter in a number that's outside of this range like 100 enter a spot to place a marker uh1 okay so we're limited to the numbers 1 through n even if I were to type zero we still can't uh so let's try something in the middle that would be 1 two 3 four five yeah and there's our marker I'm just going to add a colon then a space okay and that is the player move function we can close out of this function let's work on the computer move function next within the while loop let's invoke that function pass in our spaces array as well as whatever character the computer is then we will draw the board again right after just to update it within the computer move function we'll create a local variable named number we'll need a seed to generate a random number s Rand within the parenthesis invoke the time function pass in zero or null and we should be able to generate some random numbers so I'm going to create a while loop while the condition will be true I would like to generate a random number between 0 through 8 we'll take number set this equal to Rand function modulus 9 number will be random between 0 and 8 technically if we pick a spot number that is occupied already we'll need to reroll a random number if spaces at index of number is equal to an empty space we'll take spaces at index of number set this equal to the computer's marker then break out of this while loop Let's test this function after we pick a spot the computer will pick a spot too yep so the computer picked a spot right in the middle let's right one more time I'll pick the spot in the middle again so that would be five and our computer picked spot number two cool let's close out of the computer move function after the player moves then we draw the board again we will check a winner I'll use an if statement within the condition of the if statement we will invoke the check winner function the check winner function returns a Boolean value so that's why we're placing it within the if statement but we need to pass in a couple ARG are spaces the player and the computer if there's a winner if this evaluates to be true we will set running equal to false and we will break let's add this if statement to after the computer moves too okay let's fill in the check winner function so write down here we'll need to check all of the different win conditions there's several normally I would use a switch but it's going to get very complicated especially for beginners I think just to make this easier we'll use a bunch of if and else if statements within the first condition of the if statement we'll check to see if the first row all has matching characters so we can do that by saying spaces at index of zero is equal to spaces at index of one and spaces at index of one is equal to spaces at index of two if all three characters in the first row are the same that means that somebody won I'm going to use the tary operator here we have to determine who won the player or the computer let's check to see if the first index spaces at index zero is equal to the player's marker tary operator like we're asking a question if the player occup the first row then we'll print standard output you win otherwise standard output you lose and I'm just going to add a new line here and here okay there's one more thing we have to do with this condition and I'll explain that so let's run this oh I'll pick spot number nine you lose the reason that we lost is that we're checking to see if the first row all has the same characters they're technically all empty spaces so our program thinks that somebody won because all of these characters match there are three empty spaces I'm going to amend this if statement we'll want to ensure that none of the spaces are empty and really we only need to check the first space I'll make this amendment spaces at index of zero does not equal an empty space and all these other conditions if you'd like to keep this more organized you can always surround some of these conditions with parentheses I think it's more legible that way let's try that again just to be sure that it's working I'll pick something in the middle okay yeah so the computer doesn't win automatically if there's three empty spaces in the first row okay so that is the first win condition let's copy this condition I'll add else if now we'll check the second row if spaces at index 3 is not equal to an empty space and spaces at index 3 is equal to spaces at index 4 and spaces at index 4 is equal to spaces at index 5 then does spaces at index 3 equal to player okay so that is row two let's copy and paste that else if statement then we'll need to check the last row SPAC is at index 6 6 is 6 equal to 7 and is 7 equal to 8 so these conditions will check all of the rows then we'll need columns let's copy one of these L if statements paste it so we have 0 0 is 0 equal to 3 and is three equal to 6 okay now time for the second column spaces at index one one right here as well is 1 equal to 4 and is 4 equal to 7 copy this again paste it then we have the third column 2 2 is 2 equal to 5 and is 5 equal to 8 okay now the diagonals spaces at zero 0 is 0 equal to 4 and is four equal to 8 then the last diagonal spaces at index 2 2 is 2 equal to 4 and is four equal to 6 if there's no win conditions we'll have an else statement we will return false then all we have to do at the end of this function is to return true somebody won okay so let's test this I'll try and win with the first row one two three you win this time I'm going to try and lose one 2 4 7 whoops Seven's taken uh eight there we go you lose we can close out of the check winner function we know that it's working then we just need to check to see if there's a tie if there's no more spaces available within the the main function after our if statements we'll add else if we'll invoke the check tie function pass in our spaces check Tai returns a Boolean value if it's true we will set running to be false then break then add that after the computer move section too so right here then let's fill in this function within the check tie function we'll iterate over the elements of our array spaces we'll use a for Loop for in I equals z we'll continue this as long as I is less than 9 because there's a total size of nine spaces increment I by One if spaces at index of I is equal to an empty space that means we can continue return false there's still empty spaces if we iterate over our array and there's no empty spaces well then we'll display standard output it's a tie I'll add a new line then we will return true and we can get rid of that okay so let's close out of this check tie function then after we exit our game outside of this while loop let's display a message standard output thanks for playing all right and that's everything let's run this I'm going to try and get a tie this time one 2 6 7 8 it's a tie thanks for playing all right everybody that is a game of tic-tac-toe for beginners if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's a game of tic-tac-toe using C++ hey everybody we finally made it to dynamic memory dynamic memory is memory that is allocated after the program is already compiled and running to allocate dynamic memory we use this new keyword it's an operator it allows us to allocate memory in the Heap rather than the stack it's useful when we don't know how much memory we'll need it makes our programs more flexible especially when accepting user input because we have no idea what the user is going to type in here's an example we'll start with a basic integer variable but we'll allocate memory in the Heap rather than the stack by using that new keyword I'll create a pointer int D reference operator P num now it's good practice when when you declare a pointer but don't assign it right away to give it a value of null meaning no value to allocate memory in the Heap rather than the stack I'll take my pointer set this equal to use the new operator then a data type I'll use up enough space in the Heap for one integer the new operator will return an address we're storing that address within P num because it's a pointer it's pointing to a memory location where we're going to store an integer later on in your program whenever you would like to store a value we can use the dfference operator our pointer then assign some value like 21 I don't know just for fun I'm going to display the address that's stored within the pointer address P num then I'll add a new line as well as the value value the reference operator P num our pointer is storing this address and at this address in the Heap that address contains this value 21 now it's very good practice if not expected whenever you use the new operator you'll also want to use the delete operator when you're no longer using that memory space So at the end of this program or earlier if you choose we will delete our pointer delete P num we're freeing up the memory at this address if you don't you may cause a memory leak and it's best to avoid that whenever you use the new operator you probably should be using the delete operator some place within your program here's another example we're going to dynamically create an array let's create an array of grades Char then we'll need a pointer the reference operator P grades set this equal to null if we're not going to assign this pointer right away then to dynamically create an array we will we'll take our pointer set the equal to new the data type Char if this is an array we add a set of straight brackets within the straight brackets we will list a size if I have five grades to enter in I would type in five but if we already know the size of the array before we even run the program we might as well do that normally like create a normal array there's no point to allocating memory dynamically we would want to do that when we don't know what the size is going to be so I propose we ask for some user input let's say in size we'll create a prompt standard output how many grades to enter in standard input size will dynamically allocate enough memory in the Heap depending on how many grades the user has to enter in I'll just create a for Loop so that we will ask the user to enter in some grades in I equal 0 I will continue this as long as I is less than size increment I by 1 standard output enter grade number I + one because I will be zero to begin with and I'm just going to add colon space afterwards standard input P Cades that's our pointer now we we can either add plus I or use those straight brackets at index of I either way let's display all of the grades in I equals z i is less than size i++ standard output P grades at index of I I'll separate each with the space and remember if we no longer need this array we should delete it to prevent a memory leak if we have to delete an array we'll add a set of straight brackets after delete then our pointer PG grades and let's try it how many grades to enter in so we don't know what the user is going to type let's say six grades enter grade one a b c d f a and here are the grades so that's why dynamic memory is useful it's memory that is allocated after the program is already compiled and running we use the new operator to allocate memory in the Heap rather than the stack it's useful when we don't know how much memory we will need it makes our programs more flexible especially when accepting user input so that is an introduction to dynamic memory we'll have more practice with this in the future so don't worry if you would like a copy of the code that we worked on I'll post that in the comments section down below and well yeah that's an introduction to dynamic memory in C++ hey guys I got to explain recursion recursion is a programming technique where a function invokes itself from within we break a complex concept into repeatable single steps many problems we can approach iteratively or recursively some of the advantages of recursion include less codite and typically it's cleaner it's also useful for sorting and searching algorithms however some of the disadvantages of recursion is that it uses more memory and slower there's a trade-off it's up to you if you'd rather use an iterative approach or a recursive approach here's an example we'll break a complex concept maybe such as walking into repeatable single steps to accomplish the task of walking we would take a single step and then just repeat that a bunch of times we'll do this first iteratively then recursively so let's create a function to walk V walk there will be one parameter a number of steps let's define this walk function we'll use an iterative approach first to do that we can use a for Loop we'll set in I equals z we'll continue this as long as I is less than our steps then increment I by One I will display just you take a step then I'll add a new line so we will invoke this function pass in how many steps we would like to walk I would like to walk 100 steps and here we go we printed you take a step 100 times this is an iterative approach if we were to take a recursive approach we would invoke this function from within itself so I'm going to turn this for Loop into an if statement we'll need a base case when do we stop if steps is greater than zero we will display you take a step then I'm going to invoke the walk function from within itself then I will pass in steps minus one this would be a recursive approach we're invoking the walk function from within itself you'll end up in a function within a function within a function within a function so on and so forth so when I run this this would do the same thing but we've done so recursively the advantages with recursion is that the code tends to be easier to write I find this if statement a lot easier to understand than that for Loop although they're both pretty simple however with recursion it uses more memory and it takes more processing time in the case with our walk function I would probably stick with an iterative approach there's really not much benefit in this case but in the case of let's say a searching algorithm or navigating a tree data structure recursion would really help us with that so let's say we don't have a base case that's when we stop what if I just call the walk function forever well we end up in an infinite Loop and we would encounter what's called a stack overflow when you invoke a function you add what's called a frame to the stack when your stack is overloaded you'll encounter a stack Overflow so that's one problem with recursion so let's try a different example we'll create a factorial function if you don't remember factorial is a mathematics concept where you take a number and you multiply that number times the previous number minus one times the previous number minus one times the previous number minus one until you reach one you multiply all these numbers and you're given a result I'm going to demonstrate a function to do that both iteratively then recursively let's begin with an iterative approach we will return it integer this function will be named factorial we'll pass in an integer named num I'll immediately display the output standard output factorial then pass in some number maybe 10 let's define this function if I was to take an iterative approach I would write something like this in result this will be a local variable I'll set this equal to one I'll create a for Loop in I equal 1 we'll continue this as long as I is less than or equal to our number increment I by One I will take our result equals result times whatever I currently is at the end of this program we will return result factorial 10 that would be 3,6 28,800 if I was taking a recursive approach I would write something like this we would need a base case when do we stop if num is greater than one we will return num times invoke factorial again our number minus one else we will simply return one this would do the same thing but recursively factorial 10 is 3,628 1800 those were two different approaches to the same problem when we did this recursively we have a function call inside of a function call inside of a function call inside of a function call you get the idea personally I find a recursive approach to be a lot easier to read and understand although remember it uses more memory and a slower when you start to learn about sorting algorithms that's when recursion is really going to help you quite a lot it will simplify the steps so that's recursion everybody it's a programming technique where a function invokes itself from within we break a complex concept into repeatable single steps whenever you see a function invoking itself from within you'll know that that's recursion hey if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's recursion in C++ hey everyone let's discuss function template a function template describes what a function looks like they can be used to generate as many overloaded functions as needed each using different data types how is this useful suppose we have a Max function that will accept and return an integer int Max the parameters will be int X int y will return I'll use the tary operator here is X greater than y if so return X if not return y this function is compatible with integers as arguments let's display standard output Max then pass in two integers like one and two so this would return the number two but what if I would like to use this function with doubles such as 1.1 and 2.1 while we're truncating that decimal portion we're returning two not 2.1 if I want this function to be compatible with doubles normally I would have to create an overloaded function that accepts doubles and returns a double replace int with double and I guess this would work technically the value returned is 2.1 what about characters how about the character one and the character 2 technically we could use the max version that accepts integers because there's an Associated asky value with each of these characters but I would like an overloaded function that accepts and returns characters Char Char Char so this would return the character to this is a lot of work creating three overloaded functions that each do the same thing the only difference is that they accept and return different data types what if we could write one function that will accept any data type well that's what function templates are to create a function template take your function replace any data type with t we're returning an integer let's instead return T the data type of X will be T same thing with Y using t as a common naming convention I like to think of it as thing like we're not sure what the data type is we're returning a thing that's just how I think of it however our compiler doesn't know what T is exactly we'll need to add a template parameter declaration before this function template definition we'll add a declaration of what T is so type template angle brackets type name t and that's it this function template will work with many data types characters doubles integers you name it so yeah just replace the data type with t then be sure to add a template parameter declaration now here's a scenario what if you need to mix and match the data types I'll find what the max is between the integer 1 and the double 2.1 well we have a problem no matching function for call 2 max int double with this function template it's only set up to receive arguments of the same data type now we're passing in two different data types what we could do within our template parameter declaration is add another template name I'm going to add type name U because U comes after T in the alphabet then if you needed more you could add V WX so on and so forth I'll change one of these T's to a u this function template is set up to receive up to two different data types as arguments but there's one more change we need to make so we don't have that error anymore but the decimal portion of of our double is truncated it's returning two that's because we're still returning T and T we set to be an integer in this case do we set the return type to be t or U actually better yet we can set this to Auto using the auto keyword the compiler will deduce what the return type should be this should return 2.1 all right everybody that is a function template it describes what a function looks like they can be used to generate as many overloaded functions as needed each using different data types I like to think of it like a cookie cutter we're determining what the shape is but the arguments the dough that we use for our cookies can be different but the cookies will end up having the same shape one of the main benefits of using function templates is that we only have to write a function once and then it's compatible with different data types so you don't need multiple versions of the same function we'll generate functions using this template as needed so yeah those are function templates everybody your assignment if you choose to do so is to write a function template in the comment section down below and well yeah those are function templates in C++ well okay then everybody we got to talk about structs a struct is a structure that groups related variables under one name think of an array an array can store multiple values of the same data type well a struct can store multiple values of different data types we we can store strings along with ins doubles booleans Etc to create a struct let's do so outside of the main function type struct then we need an identifier this is kind of like the data type suppose we're going to group related variables for students I'll name this identifier student within the structure of student variables that we declare are known as members I think each student should have a name member this will be of the string data type string name I'll declare this but not yet assign it as well as a GPA that could be of the double data type then a Boolean variable if they're currently enrolled or not enrolled then be sure to end your struct with a semicolon our struct student is kind of like its own data type we can use this data type to declare variables I'll create a student variable of this data type and that variable will have these three different members a name a GPA and a Boolean variable for being enrolled much like with creating a variable we type the data type student and then some name some identifier let's name the first student student one student one will have its own name GPA and enrolled status if I would like to assign the name member of student one I would type the name of the student student one followed by dot members can be accessed with a DOT also known as the class member access operator I'll assign the name member and set this equal to SpongeBob I'll assign student 1's GPA student 1. GPA I'll give SpongeBob a solid 3.2 then I could set his enrolled status student one. enrolled I'll set this to be true then we could access these members I'll display them standard output student 1. name I'll add a new line let's do the same thing with GPA and enrolled student 1. GPA student 1. enrolled this is what this looks like we have a student variable the name member is SpongeBob SpongeBob has a GPA of 3.2 when accessing Boolean variables one corresponds with true zero corresponds with false enrolled a set to true so that would return one let's reuse the struct to create a second student I'll just copy what we have here then paste it we'll give the second student a different identifier such as student two student two will have a name member of Patrick a GPA of 2.1 and he will be enrolled that's set to True let's display student 2's members student 2.n name student 2. GPA then student 2. enrolled these first members correspond with student one SpongeBob 3.2 one for True the second set is for student 2 Patrick has a GPA of 2.1 and Patrick is currently enrolled okay one last example let's create student three let's copy what we have paste it student student 3 student 3. name student 3. GPA student 3. en rolled student 3's name will be Squidward Squidward has a GPA of 1.5 let's set enrolled to be false then display student 3's members student 3. name student 3. GPA student 3. enrolled and here are student 3's members Squidward 1.5 and zero that means false now with members you can set a default value all set enrolled to be true then we don't need to explicitly state that underneath SpongeBob Patrick and Squidward their enrolled member is all set to one with members you can set a default value so yeah those are strs it's a structure that groups related variables under one name strs can contain many different data types variables in a struct are known as members and members can be accessed with a DOT the class member AIS operator so those are strs your assignment is to post a struct in the comment section down below and well yeah those are strs in C++ hey everybody in this topic I'm going to show you how we can pass a struct to a function in C++ suppose we have a struct the identifier of the struct will be cars then we'll create some members related to cars how about a model standard string model a year in year then a color standard string color then let's go ahead and create two car structs how about car car one car car 2 then we'll assign the members car one. model pick a model of a card that you like then a year and a color let's do the same thing with Car 2 car 2. model car 2. year car 2.c color let's pick some different data that'll work suppose we have a function to display the members of a car void how about print car we're printing the members we'll need some parameters the data type of what we're passing in are car structs so we'll list that as the data type then some nickname for the argument that we receive how about just car then I will display the members standard output car. model should probably add a new line too then do the same thing with year and color car doe car. color Let's test this by printing car one print car 1 we will pass the name of a struct as an argument uh then I think we're just missing a function declaration so if you're missing that be sure to add that there now let's run this okay here's our car Mustang 2023 and the color is red now with structs they're passed by value rather than passed by reference if we pass a struct as an argument what we're doing is creating a copy of the original struct to demonstrate that let's display the address of car1 before and within the function standard output address of operator car one I'll add a new line then let's do that within the function too the parameter name is car not car one there so let's try that so these addresses are different when we pass the struct to a function the function will create a copy of it it's pass by value we're displaying the members of the copy rather than the original if you need to work with the original struct you can use the address of operator we're passing a reference to the original car struct then be sure to change that within the function declaration as well so let's take a look at the addresses now yeah these addresses are the same car 2 is feeling pretty lonely so let's print Car 2 as well print car pass in Car 2 as an argument to this function so we should have car one and Car 2 this time let's change one of the members within a function let's create a function to paint car painted a different color paint car there will be two arguments an address to a car as well as a color which will be of the string data type be sure to add a function declaration if you're missing it then within this function we will take our car. color equals the new color that we receive now before we print our cars let's paint them a different color paint car we have two arguments this time a car struct and a new color let's paint our Mustang silver then let's paint car2 maybe gold then let's display this okay our Mustang is now silver and our Corvette is now gold so if we didn't use the address of operator When painting our car let me show you what happens our cars are still the original colors red and blue what we did within this function is that we created a copy of our car struct and changed the color of the copies rather than the originals so if you need to make any changes to the original you would want to use the address of operator so that's how to pass structs to functions you can pass by value which can be expensive or you can pass by reference your assignment if you choose to do so is to post a function that accepts a struct as an argument and that's how to pass structs to functions in C++ hey everybody we got to talk about enums enums also means enumerations it's a userdefined data type that consists of paired named integer constants they're great if you have a set of potential options here's an example suppose we have a day of the week standard string today then pick a day I'll pick Sunday normally you can't use strings within switches but we can use enums which are kind of similar let me explain so I'm going to create a switch we will examine today normally we can't do this because it's a string we'll examine today against many matching cases case Sunday and I'll speed up the footage okay here's my switch depending on what day of the week it is we'll display a custom message it is either Sunday through Saturday one of these days so normally we can't use strings within switches this is what happens when we attempt that error switch quantity not an integer something similar that we can use are enums they're paired named integer constants we have a name and an Associated value they're interchangeable at the top of my program I will declare Eno then a name for the set of enumerations let's say day for day of the week we have Sunday Monday Tuesday and you know the rest you can associate a value with each of these names Sunday equals z Monday equals 1 then we'll just continue on with with the rest of these I'm going to group these together like that okay we have our enum setup this identifier is kind of like the new data type we're not working with strings anymore we're working with days these are a set of potential options each option is a pair of a name and some Associated value you can really pick any value I went with the numbers 0 through 6 to represent the day of the week I'm going to set today to Sunday this name we can now use this within a switch there's an Associated integer value but we'll change the cases from strings to that enum data type and this would work it is Sunday within the cases you could use the associated values as well I'm going to change today to be Friday case Zero is Sunday Monday is 1 2 3 4 5 6 it is Friday so that also works but I don't think it's as readable another cool thing with enums is that enom variables take only one value of the set if I try and make up some value like P Pizza day well we can't do that pizza day was not declared in the scope here's a few other enum examples you could create a set of enums for flavors vanilla chocolate strawberry mint an important note is that if you're working with enums and you don't assign an integer value to each of these names you'll implicitly assign zero to the first name then one 2 three kind of like what I did up here but we explicitly assigned those values we have six colors or maybe planets I have a set of enums of the nine planets in our solar system the associated integer is the size of each planet in kilometers so yeah those are enums they're a userdefined data type that consists of paired named integer constants they're great if you have a set of potential options your assignment is to post a set of enums in the comment section down below and well yeah those are enums in C++ hey everybody so we have finally made it to object-oriented programming an object think of it as a collection of attributes and methods attributes are characteristics of an object methods are functions that an object can perform objects can be used to mimic real world items so look around you right now next to me I have a phone a book and a dog think of attributes as characteristics what kinds of characteristics would a phone have maybe a version number a charge a service provider objects can also contain methods what kinds of actions can a phone perform they can make calls receive calls play games now with a book some of the attributes of a book could be maybe an author number of pages let's see what kinds of methods can a book perform really not much you can open a book and you can close it so those are just a few okay last lastly how about a dog object some of the attributes of a dog could be a name an age maybe a breed of dog then what kinds of actions can dogs perform they can eat they can bark they can sleep maybe play fetch so I think you get the idea an object is a collection of attributes and methods Now to create an object we can use a Class A class acts as a blueprint to create objects let's create a class to create human objects I will type class human curly braces I'm going to add a public access modifier we'll learn about access modifiers pretty soon I would like these attributes and methods to be publicly accessible let's start with the attributes of humans what kinds of characteristics can humans have how about a name this will be of the string data type I'll declare this attribute but not yet assign it maybe an occupation like a job standard string occupation then maybe an age int age our class human has these attributes humans have a name an occupation and an age that's good enough for this example now let's cover methods a method is a function that belongs to a class it's something that an object can do an action it can perform what sorts of actions should our humans be able to perform how about an e method void e I'll just display a message standard output uh let's say this person is eating humans can drink void drink standard output this person is drinking okay one last example how about sleep human sleep right void sleep standard output this person is sleeping good enough oh then make sure we add a semicolon to the end of the class perfect okay so we now have a human class we can use this class as a blueprint to create human objects each human object will have a name an occupation and an age they can also eat drink or sleep they have their own functions which we call methods so to create a human object we will type the name of the class human then a unique identifier how about human one that's creative so human one is an object human one has a name an occupation and an age but we have not assigned these attributes let's say human one's name human one member AIS modifier which is a DOT name equals Rick then human ones occupation equals scientist human ones age equals 70 let's verify that this worked by printing out these attributes standard output human one. name I'll add a new line then let's repeat this for occupation and age human one. occupation human 1.age human one's name is Rick his occupation is a scientist his age is 70 years old so this part is kind of similar to strs however objects can also perform actions they have methods Rick can eat drink and sleep so to invoke those methods I would type the name of my object human one and let's have human one eat so human one. eat add a set of parentheses to invoke this method okay this person is eating let's also test drink and sleep human one. drink human one. sleep okay this person is eating this person is drinking this person is sleeping and that is our human human one for more practice let's create a second human human human 2 I'm going to copy these lines let's change human one to human 2 human 2's name will be Morty occupation will be student age what about 15 I'm going to display the attributes of human 2 this time then I'll have human 2 invoke its methods eat drink then sleep okay human 2's name is Morty their occupation is a student Morty is 15 years old then Mor Mor can perform these actions eat drink and sleep now you can assign some default attributes so let's say that all humans we create will be named Rick it's kind of like we're cloning him his occupation will be scientist age will be 70 I'm not going to assign these attributes what I did is that I added some default attributes so we have human one and human 2 I'll display the attributes of human one first then human 2 human 1name occupation age then we have human 2's attributes as well so remember I am not assigning these attributes within the main function we have two humans they're both named Rick they're both scientists and they're both age 70 okay now here's one last example to really get the hang of objects let's create a different class this time how about cars Class Car let's add a public access modifier then what kinds of attributes would cars have perhaps a make standard string make a model standard string model a year that would be an INT then maybe a color standard string color you can add some default attributes but I'll just leave those empty for now you can add some methods what kinds of actions can cars take I guess you can accelerate void accelerate standard output uh what can we print you step on the gas then maybe break void break standard output you step on the brakes then be sure to add a semicolon to the end of your class because I always forget to do that okay we now have a car class it acts as a blueprint to create car objects to create an object we would type the name of the Class Car in this example then a unique identifier for the object let's say car one then we can assign some of the attributes of this car object car 1. make maybe Ford car one. model equals Mustang I like Mustangs car 1. year equals 2023 then a color car 1. color maybe silver okay then just to test these let's print these attributes standard output car one. make I'll add a new line let's copy this line paste it three times then we'll display the model year then color okay our car object is a Ford Mustang the year is 2023 the color is silver not only does our car have attributes but it has methods actions it can perform as well our car can accelerate and it can break Let's test that car 1. accelerate car 1. break okay you step on the gas you step on the brakes then if I need a second car object I can type car car 2 then I can assign the attributes and I have access to its methods so yeah that's an object everybody it's a collection of attributes and methods attributes are characteristics of an object methods are functions that an object can perform so yeah those are objects everybody in the next video we're going to cover Constructors your assignment is to post a class in the comment section down below so yeah that's an introduction to object-oriented programming in C++ hey everybody welcome back so in today's video we're going to discuss Construction S A Constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object is instantiated it's useful for assigning values to attributes as arguments before when we were assigning attributes to an object we would say for example car 1. make equals Ford well with a Constructor we can do that automatically here's an example this time let's create a student class class student I'll add a public access modifier what attributes Should students have how about a name standard string name int age double GPA sounds good to me then if I need to create a student object I would type the name of the class student a unique identifier for this specific object let's say student one then to assign some of the attributes right away I could use a Constructor we do have a Constructor that is automatically called behind the scenes but we could explicitly set one up the Constructor has the same name as the class in this case student add a set of parentheses add a set of curly braces think of this as a function we can set up parameters when we instantiate a student object we will automatically call this function the instructor then pass arguments let's set up some parameters we have standard string name int AG double GPA then when I instantiate a student object I will add a set of parentheses after the object name then pass in my arguments let me just zoom in real quick okay in order to instantiate a student object we need to pass in a name an age and a GPA so for the first student student one's name will be SpongeBob his age will be I don't know how old SpongeBob is let's say he's 25 SpongeBob's GPA will be a solid 3.2 when we instantiate our student object we will pass these values as arguments to the Constructor now to assign these attributes with these parameters we first need to select these attributes in this example I gave them the same same name just to remove ambiguity if I'm referring to these attributes I will type this then an arrow name equals the name of the parameter name this name equals my name parameter this Arrow age equals my age parameter this Arrow GPA equals my GPA so now let's test this I will display student 1's name age and GPA standard output student one. name add a new line then we have age then GPA okay we got SpongeBob he's 25 years old his GPA is 3.2 so you can see that we don't need to necessarily add these values to these attributes manually you can do that automatically with a Constructor so another way in which you may see this Constructor set up is with the parameter names being different from the attribute names perhaps instead of name age and GPA let's say X Y then Z if the attribute names are different from the parameter names you don't need the this keyword you could say name equals x age equals y GPA equals z and this would work too if you prefer this way of doing things you can do that uh just my own personal preference I like to use the this keyword and then keep my parameters the same but that's just me you do you let's create a couple more students and it's kind of nice because we can reuse this Constructor let's create student 2 student student 2 student two will be Patrick I don't know how old Patrick is let's say Patrick is 40 uh Patrick's GPA will be 1.5 okay to test this let's display student 2's name age and GPA okay we got Patrick he's 40 years old GPA is 1.5 one last student student student 3 student 3 will be Sandy Sandy is uh how about 21 years old and sy's GPA is a perfect 4.0 okay now we'll display student 3's name age GPA okay we got Sandy her age is 21 GPA is 4 well 4.0 let's do one last example just to reinforce our understanding of Constructors let's create an entirely new class let's go back to our car class I'm going to get rid of all this so we need a class class car set of curly braces add a semicolon to the end I will add a public access modifier in the last topic we decided that cars had four attributes a make standard string make a model standard string model in year standard string color now we'll create a Constructor for our car objects it has the same name as the class name car set of parenthesis set of curly braces we can set up some parameters we have make model year and color I think I'm just going to copy this to save time you can rename these if you want but I like to keep them the same then I will assign this Arrow make equals make this Arrow model equals model this Arrow year equals year this Arrow color equals color when we create a car object we'll need to pass in these arguments I will create car car one add a set of parenthesis pass in my arguments a make model year and color I'll create a Chevy Corvette the year will be 2022 the color is blue I'm going to display the attributes standard output car 1. make I'll add a new line then I will display the model year then color color model year color car one is a Chevy Corvette the year is 2022 the color is blue let's create a second car car car 2 Car 2 will be a Ford Mustang the year will be 2023 the color will be read I will display c2's attributes we have a Ford Mustang the year is 2023 the color is red so yeah that's a Constructor everybody a Constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is instantiated it's useful for assigning values to attributes as arguments when you create an object from the class add a set of parentheses then add your arguments within the construct you can assign those arguments to the attributes of that class in the next topic we'll cover overloaded Constructors if you're looking for some additional practice in the comment section down below post a class that contains a Constructor and well yeah those are Constructors in C++ overloaded Constructors are when we have multiple Constructors with the same name but different parameters they allow for a varying number of arguments ments when instantiating an object here's an example we'll create Pizza objects from a pizza class let's type Class Pizza add a set of curly braces a semicolon to the end will make our members publicly accessible so pizzas they can have a variable number of toppings right you can have no toppings one topping two toppings three toppings suppose we have just one topping to begin with topping one and that will be of the string data type standard string topping one then I will create a pizza Constructor it has the same name as the class name Pizza parentheses curly braces we'll set up some parameters standard string topping one in order to construct a pizza we have to pass in one topping so let's do that we have pizza pizza one and I will pass in one argument for a topping I feel like pepperoni then we'll just need to assign this argument to this attribute this Arrow topping one equals topping one the name of this parameter then to test this let's display topping one standard output Pizza one do topping one okay we have pizza 1 that contains pepperoni now what if if you would like a pizza that has two toppings suppose we have pizza 2 Pizza Pizza 2 this time I'm going to attempt to pass in two arguments how about mushrooms and peppers well when I run this program we're going to have an error error no matching function for call to Pizza with two arguments we can create an additional Constructor that accepts different arguments let's copy what we have and paste it this Constructor will take two string arguments topping one and Topping two so we have two toppings this time and I should probably create another attribute for a second topping standard string topping two this topping two equals topping two so now with pizza 2 let's display topping one as well as topping two now Pizza 2 contains mushrooms and peppers what if you would like a pizza with no toppings like a plain cheese pizza well we could set that up pizza pizza 3 I'm going to attempt to add a set of parentheses after Pizza 3 but pass in no arguments but we have a warning our compiler is saying we should get rid of the parentheses if we're passing in no arguments we don't need that set of parentheses but we still have an error here no matching function call for pizza with no arguments if we're creating an object and passing in no arguments we'll need a matching Constructor so at the top I'll create a a pizza Constructor with no arguments and that should make that error go away so this should run and compile just fine then yep no errors so yeah those are overloaded Constructors you can have multiple Constructors with the same name as long as the parameters are different we have three Constructors with the same name we can create a pizza with no toppings one topping or two toppings overloaded Constructors allow for multiple objects with a varying number of attributes if you're looking for some additional exercises post a class with overloaded Constructors in the comment section down below and well yeah those are overloaded Constructors in C++ hey everyone let's talk about Getters and Setters Getters and Setters are used within this concept of abstraction where we hide any unnecessary data from outside of a class Getters are functions that make a private attribute readable Setters are functions that make a private attribute writable here's an example I'm going to create a stove object class stove then I will instantiate a stove object stove stove in previous topics when we created attributes we would use the public access specifier then write any attributes in this example let's say int temperature I'll go ahead and set this to zero right away since this attribute temperature is public it's accessible from outside of the class that means that people can change it for example I will take my stove object set the temperature attribute to a really high setting that doesn't exist like a million this is fine then I can display the temperature standard output the temperature setting is stove. temperature the temperature setting is 1 million I don't want people to mess with my temperature attribute what I could do instead is set these attributes to be private we're following that rule of abstraction we're hiding any un necessary data from a user that they don't need we no longer have access to this temperature attribute from outside of the class you can see we have some red underlines temperature is private within this context this is a hidden attribute from the outside world if I need access to the value found within this temperature I can write a getter it's a function that will make an attribute readable I'll add a public access specifier then write a getter we're returning an integer I'll write get then the attribute name temperature all I'm going to do is return our temperature I can no longer update or change the temperature it's readable but not writable so I'm going to turn this line into a comment in place of accessing this attribute directly I'm going to invoke the get temperature method stove. getet temperature add a set of parentheses now the current temperature setting is set to zero adding a getter will make an attribute readable if you need a private attribute to also be writable you can add a Setter void set temperature this Arrow temperature equals our temperature that we pass in then we just need a parameter int temperature in order for a user to change the temperature they would need to invoke the set temperature method then they can pass in a new temperature using this Setter they can still set the temperature to whatever they want like a million in the previous example the temperature setting is set to 1 million within a Setter we can add some additional logic or checks before we do set the temperature let's check to see what the temperature is if the temperature the user passes in is less than zero we will set this temperature to be zero else if the temperature is greater than or equal to 10 suppose this is a knob with different settings the numberers 0 through 10 this temperature equals 10 in case they type in a million it'll just max out at 10 else this temperature equals temperature I could attempt to set the temperature to a million but it would just max out at 10 or we could try a negative number like -3 well now the temperature setting is set to zero as if the stove was off or anything in between maybe five something right in the the middle the temperature setting is five so yeah that's kind of the purpose of Getters and Setters they make a private attribute either readable or writable or both if you use both one additional step you can take too is that if you have a Constructor you can invoke the Setters within a Constructor within my stove class I have a Constructor if we were to receive a temperature we could set the temperature right away so we already have this line of code within our Setter so we don't necessarily need this line again we would instead invoke the setter set temperature pass in our temperature then if I was to instantiate a stove object I would have to pass in a temperature I'll set it to be zero and this temperature setting is set to zero so yeah those are Getters and Setters everybody a getter makes a private attribute readable a Setter makes a private attribute writable within the Getters and Setters you can perform additional checks or logic which is pretty nice if you're looking for some additional practice post a class that has a getter and Setter in the comment section down below and well yeah those are Getters and Setters in C++ hey guys let's talk about inheritance inheritance is when a class can receive attributes and methods from another class the receiving class is known as a child class the class that's being inherited from is known as the parent class it's kind of like how children will inherit their parents genes and some of their physical traits it's kind of the same concept a benefit of inheritance is that it helps to reuse similar code found within multiple classes here's an example we will create an animal class the animal class will be the parent class class animal I'll make these members publicly accessible all animals will have a Boolean attribute that we will name alive if you're an animal you're alive then let's add a method maybe an eat method all animals should be able to eat void eat we'll just print a generic message standard output this animal is is eating I'm going to create two classes a dog class and a cat class they will inherit from the animal class let's begin with dog class dog to inherit from another class you would add a colon then public the name of the parent class dog will inherit from the animal class then out of curly braces semicolon add at the end and we now have a dog class now check this out if I create a dog object it will have a Boolean variable named alive as well as an eat method so let's create a dog object dog dog so I'm going to display that Boolean variable dog. alive if I display this attribute this will give me one which means true this dog object also has an eat method dog do eat add aide of parenthesis to invoke it this animal is eating so even though there's nothing within this dog class it's inheriting everything from within the animal class and we could add some additional attributes and methods as well maybe just a method this time I would like to give my dog the ability to speak so let's make this public void maybe bark standard output the dog goes woof my dog is alive and it can eat my dog can also bark as well it has its own attributes and methods too I would like my dog to bark okay my dog is alive that's set to one the animal is eating the dog goes woof so now let's create a cat class class cat the cat class will inherit from the animal class I'll make its members publicly accessible I will give cats a meow function void meow standard output the cat goes meow there okay now we can create a cat object Cat Cat Let's print the alive Boolean variable of my cat cat. eat now I'm going to try and use the bark method of a cat which we don't have let's attempt to use that so class cat has no member named bark that's because that method is found within the dog class and not the cat class cats have a meow method I'm instead going to use the meow method are cats alive the animal is eating the cat goes meow so that's kind of how inheritance Works a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class it helps with code reusability you know technically you could add these attributes and methods to each of these classes for example I'll just add the Boolean variable alive to each of these classes as well as the eat method you know this would work too but we're repeating ourselves and with programming we try not to repeat ourselves if we don't have to especially because if we have to make a change to the eat method let's change eat to n Nom Nom well I would have to go to each class and make that change manually and that can be inconvenient if I have hundreds of different classes it would be a lot easier if I just had to make that change in one place so I'm going to revert all those changes if I need to make a change to one of these methods I'm going to change e to display n Nom Nom well then I just have to make that change in one place instead of for every individual class let's try another example we'll create a class named shape this will be the parent class we'll make the members publicly accessible any class that inherits from the shape class will have a double attribute that we will name area for surface area double volume in this example we won't have any methods this time just some attributes I'm going to create class Cube cube is the child class it will inherit from the parent class shape so colon public the name of the parent shape even though there's nothing within my Cube class my Cube class has an error area and volume attribute then let's make a sphere class class sphere there we go I'm going to add a public access modifier all cubes will have a double side property then with spheres they will have Double Radius then I'm going to add a Constructor for both cubes and spheres let's begin with Cube Cube then sphere in order to instantiate a cube object I need to pass it aside as an argument when I construct an object double side then for the sphere we need a radius Double Radius I think what we'll do is that when we construct a cube object and a sphere object we'll calculate the area and the volume based on either the side that we pass in for a cube or the radius for a sphere let's begin with the cube first let's assign the length of a side remember with a cube the length the width and the height are all the same this Arrow side equals side to calculate the area we can use this formula so this area equals side * side * 6 because there's six sides to a cube then if you need the volume you could say this Arrow volume equals side to the^ of three we could just say side time side time side just to keep it simple now with the sphere it's a little more complex first let's assign the radius this Arrow radius equals radius let's calculate the area of a sphere this Arrow area equals to calculate the area of a sphere that would be 4 * Pi let's just say 3.14159 time radius squared so radius time radius then let's calculate the volume this Arrow volume equals to calculate the volume of a sphere the formula is 4 / 3 * pi * radius cubed so that would be 4 / 3.0 make sure to divide by 3.0 and not 3 because in this case we would be using integer division we would like to keep that decimal so 3.0 time Pi that's 3.14159 time radius cubed to keep it simple we can say radius time radius time radius and there we go okay so let's create a cube object to begin with Cube I'll name this this object just Cube then in order to construct a cube object we need to pass in the length of a side let's say 10 so my Cube class inherits the area and volume attribute from the shape class within the Constructor of the cube class we will calculate what the area and the volume is going to be and I will display that standard output area q do area then I'll add centimet then let's do the same thing with volume volume cube. volume if the length of a side is 10 the area is going to be 600 cm squar the volume is 1,000 cm cubed now let's try this with our sphere sphere I'll name this object sphere then we will pass in the radius let's say five I would like to display the sphere's area and the sphere's volume the area would be 314 cm squared the volume is 523 cm cubed so yeah that's inheritance everybody a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class if you have multiple classes and they share similar attributes or methods you can place them within a parent class and all of those individual classes can inherit from that one common class it helps with code reusability and you don't have to repeat yourself if you're looking for some additional practice post a parent class and a child class in the comment section down below and well yeah that's an introduction to inheritance in C++"
fc19HhHKtrA,C++ dynamic memory explained for beginners 🧠,2022-05-23T03:17:47Z,hey everybody we finally made it to dynamic memory dynamic memory is memory that is allocated after the program is already compiled and running to allocate dynamic memory we use this new keyword it's an operator it allows us to allocate memory in the heap rather than the stack it's useful when we don't know how much memory we'll need it makes our programs more flexible especially when accepting user input because we have no idea what the user is going to type in here's an example we'll start with a basic integer variable but we'll allocate memory in the heap rather than the stack by using that new keyword i'll create a pointer int the reference operator p num now it's good practice when you declare a pointer but don't assign it right away to give it a value of null meaning no value to allocate memory in the heap rather than the stack i'll take my pointer set the sql to use the new operator then a data type i'll use up enough space in the heap for one integer the new operator will return an address we're storing that address within pnum because it's a pointer it's pointing to a memory location where we're going to store an integer later on in your program whenever you would like to store a value we can use the dereference operator our pointer then assign some value like 21 i don't know just for fun i'm going to display the address that's stored within the pointer address p num then i'll add a new line as well as the value value dereference operator p num our pointer is storing this address and at this address in the heap that address contains this value 21. now it's very good practice if not expected whenever you use the new operator you'll also want to use the delete operator when you're no longer using that memory space so at the end of this program or earlier if you choose we will delete our pointer delete p num we're freeing up the memory at this address if you don't you may cause a memory leak and it's best to avoid that whenever you use the new operator you probably should be using the delete operator someplace within your program here's another example we're going to dynamically create an array let's create an array of grades char then we'll need a pointer the reference operator p grades set this equal to null if we're not going to assign this pointer right away then to dynamically create an array we will take our pointer set the sql to new the data type char if this is an array we add a set of straight brackets within the straight brackets we will list a size if i have five grades to enter in i would type in five but if we already know the size of the array before we even run the program we might as well do that normally like create a normal array there's no point to allocating memory dynamically we would want to do that when we don't know what the size is going to be so i propose we ask for some user input let's say int size we'll create a prompt standard output how many grades to enter in standard input size will dynamically allocate enough memory in the heap depending on how many grades the user has to enter in i'll just create a for loop so that we will ask the user to enter in some grades and i equals zero i will continue this as long as i is less than size increment i by one standard output enter grade number i plus 1 because i will be 0 to begin with and i'm just going to add colon space afterwards standard input p grades that's our pointer now we can either add plus i or use those straight brackets at index of i either way let's display all of the grades and i equals zero i is less than size i plus plus standard output p grades at index of i i'll separate each with the space and remember if we no longer need this array we should delete it to prevent a memory leak if we have to delete an array we'll add a set of straight brackets after delete then our pointer p grades and let's try it how many grades to enter in so we don't know what the user is going to type let's say six grades enter grade one a b c d f a and here are the grades so that's why dynamic memory is useful it's memory that is allocated after the program is already compiled and running we use the new operator to allocate memory in the heap rather than the stack it's useful when we don't know how much memory we will need it makes our programs more flexible especially when accepting user input so that is an introduction to dynamic memory we'll have more practice with this in the future so don't worry if you would like a copy of the code that we worked on i'll post that in the comments section down below and well yeah that's an introduction to dynamic memory in c plus plus
bwqy8RZxrS4,Useful string methods in JavaScript 〰️【4 minutes】,2022-04-22T15:43:55Z,hey welcome back everybody so let's talk about some useful string properties and methods I have a variable user name and assign this whatever your first and last name is if we type this variable and add a DOT we have access to a bunch of different properties and methods of this string one of which is the length property this will give us the length of a string how many characters are within the string we could assign this to a variable name length equal username length or we could display it I'm going to display this with a console.log statement console.log username do length the length of my name is eight characters but yours will likely be something different let's cover a few more we can get the character of a string at a given index type the name of the string variable do Char at add a set of parentheses whatever character you would like to return you will add the index of that character computers always start with zero so the first character in the string would have an index of zero so maybe I would like to assign this to a variable let first letter equal username do Char at index0 or you know I could display it with console.log and then just add this variable and Method within the parentheses the character at index zero of my string is B then index one would be r two would be o that is the Char at method you can find the index of the first occurrence of a letter type the variable name username dot index of then pass in a character you would like to find the first index of how about o and then I will display this with console.log the index of the first occurrence of the character o is at index 2 012 there's also Al last index of last index of and we'll keep that as o the last occurrence of O has an index of five 0 1 2 3 4 5 we can also trim spaces before and after a string so I'm going to display this as it is and I'll turn these into comments okay console.log username and we have all the space that we would like to get rid of so to do that we will reassign username with username do trim this gets rid of any empty spaces before and after any other characters we could make our string all uppercase username equals username do2 uppercase and my name is all uppercase there's also lowercase two lowercase and all the characters are now lowercase okay here's another replace all but this time let's create a phone number let phone number equal then within a set of quotes make up some phone number with dashes 1 23- 456-7890 okay using the replace all method I can replace all given characters with another one so phone number equals phone number do replace all so this has two arguments the character we would like to replace add a comma the second character is what we'll be replacing all of these dashes with how about a forward slash and we will display phone number so here's my phone number if you would like to eliminate these dashes then just don't type in anything and those dashes are gone so yeah those are a few useful string properties and methods if you have a string variable add a DOT and you have access to a bunch of different properties and methods a lot of which we didn't cover but these are just a few of the basics so yeah those are some useful string properties and methods if this video helped you out you can help me out by Smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
dWsjatPhWHQ,What is the ternary operator ❓,2022-04-21T12:36:34Z,okay guys we are talking about the ternary operator which is represented by a question mark followed by a colon it's a replacement to using an if else statement you write a condition then add a question mark kind of like you're asking a question is something true if that condition is true we can do some code if it's false we do some other code here's an example we have a grade my grade is 75. if grade is greater than or equal to 60 i'll output you pass else will output you fail my grade is 75 therefore i pass another way of writing this is to use the ternary operator first we write a condition so let's get rid of this if statement after our condition we'll add a question mark now parentheses are optional then we write some expression standard output you pass we do this if our condition is true colon what will we do if that condition is false well let's use whatever's within our else statement and this would work the same if my grade is 75 you pass if it's 50 you fail let's come up with a few other examples let's check to see if a number is even or odd int number equals what about nine we write a condition we'll check if number modulus 2. remember modulus gives you the remainder of any division does number divide by 2 evenly so this returns a 1 or a 0. if number modulus 2 is equal to 1 question mark then let's display odd if it's false we'll display standard output even okay odd let's change number to eight now it's even you don't necessarily need equals one or equal zero the number one does correspond to true and zero corresponds to false so you could write it like this too eight divides by two evenly that's even if it's nine that is odd okay last example let's examine a boolean variable bull how about hungry is somebody hungry i'll set this to be true let's write our condition hungry equals true question mark now if you're examining to see if a boolean variable is true you don't necessarily need equals true you can just say that boolean variable hungry question mark like you're asking a question so if hungry is true we will do this standard output you are hungry colon what will we do if it's false standard output you are full hungry is set to true you are hungry if it were false you are full if we're displaying output there's a couple different ways in which we could write this it's up to you how you want to handle it so another way of writing the same code would be standard output then within a set of parentheses then we could use our ternary operator hungry question mark you are hungry else you are full this would work as well let's just check that hungry is set to false you are full let's set it to true you are hungry so yeah that's the ternary operator everybody it's a question mark followed by a colon you write a condition as if you're asking a question if that condition is true you do some expression if not you do some other expression it's a replacement to an if else statement your assignment is to post a use of the trinary operator in the comment section and well yeah that's the ternary operator in c plus
kO3eEn_hgQc,What&#39;s an if statement? 🤔,2022-04-21T12:35:50Z,all right guys we are on if statements with an if statement you do something if a condition you set is true if not then don't do it it's as simple as that we'll ask a user what their age is if their age is greater than or equal to 18 they'll be allowed into our site if they're under 18 well we won't let them in let's declare variable age int age then we'll create a prompt standard output enter your age standard input age okay this is how to write an if statement you type if then a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces if some condition within the parentheses is true you perform some subset of code we are going to check if age is greater than or equal to 18. greater than or equal to is a comparison operator there's other comparison operators such as less than or equals to less than greater than if you need to compare if two values are equal you use two equal signs you don't wanna say equals because then you're setting age equal to eighteen equals is the assignment operator so let's check to see if age is greater than or equal to eighteen then we'll print a message standard output welcome to the site okay let's try this enter your edge let's say that i'm 12. well it doesn't do anything since this condition evaluated to be false we skip over this body of code if it were true then we execute it this time my age is 21. i hit enter welcome to the site if you would rather do something else if a condition is false you can use an else statement an else statement you will place at the end there is no condition else we will print standard output you are not old enough to enter okay let's try this again and to your age i'll say that i'm 12 you are not old enough to enter that's an if statement if some condition is true you do something if not you can do something else or nothing at all there are more conditions you can check by using an else if statement we can check another condition by adding else if if this condition is false check this else if condition uh let's check to see if age is less than zero that means somebody hasn't been born yet you haven't been born yet okay now check this out let's say that my age is negative 10. then i hit enter you haven't been born yet since this condition was false we skipped this section of code then we check the else if statement since this condition was true we execute this body of code then skip over the else statement let's add one more elsif statement else if age is greater than or equal to 100 standard output you are too old to enter this site okay enter your age i am 120 years old i hit enter welcome to the site we check these conditions one by one starting from the top we stated that our age was 120 years old even though we were expecting to execute this body of code we instead executed this body of code within the if statement that's because our age was technically still greater than or equal to 18. so the order of your if and else if statements does matter it makes a difference if we need to execute this body of code if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 100 well then we should probably move that to the top then turn it into an if statement else if age is greater than or equal to 18 we will display this message let's try this one more time and to your age i am 120 years old i hit enter you are too old to enter the site so yeah that's an if statement you do something if a condition is true if not then you don't do it if you would rather do something else you can use an else statement if there's other conditions you would like to check before reaching the else statement you can use an else if statement and there's really no limit to these if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah those are if statements in c plus
Bx9b12FCF5o,What is a switch? 🔀,2022-04-21T12:36:14Z,all right everybody today we're going to discuss switches a switch is an alternative to using many else if statements it compares one value against many matching cases here's an example of what you don't want to do i have this program we have variable month month is of the integer data type the user will type in a number 1 through 12 to represent the month if month is equal to 1 it is january else if month is equal to two it is february else if month is three four five so on and so forth this is what you don't want to do because it's inefficient it's how the game yandere simulator was created if you know what that is a better solution would be to use a switch this is how to write one i'm going to delete all of this we will type switch parentheses curly braces what value would we like to examine against matching cases let's examine our month to write a case we would type case then the value let's check to see if month is equal to one so case one colon on the next line what we want to do if month is equal to one let's display a message standard output it is january at the end of this case add break to break out of the switch so that is case one let's work on case two so case two it is february i think the rest is self-explanatory i'll speed up the footage we have our 12 cases 1 through 12. each case corresponding with a month of the year let's run this enter the month let's say that the month is 4 for april it is april one more time the month is 12 it is december so a switch is an alternative to using many else if statements it's more efficient and easier to read if there are no matching cases we can execute a default case type default then what would we like to do standard output let's say please enter in only numbers 1 through 12. enter the month uh let's type negative 42. please enter in only numbers 1 through 12. so the default case is kind of like the else statement if there are no matching cases we execute whatever's within the default case let's try one more example this time we'll have a user enter in a character a letter grade will display a custom message depending on what grade they have char grid standard output what letter grade standard input grade then we'll create a switch switch parentheses curly braces we're examining our letter grade against matching cases the first case will be the character a what will we display if somebody receives an a standard output you did great then break case b standard output you did good then break case c standard output you did okay break case d standard output you did not do good break case f standard output you failed break then let's add a default case please only enter in a letter grade a through f let's try it what letter grade i received in a you did great what letter grid f you failed then let's test our default case what letter grid pizza please only enter in a letter grade a through f so yeah that's a switch everybody it's an alternative to using many else if statements it's more efficient and easier to read your assignment is to create a switch and post it in the comments section and well yeah those are switches in c plus
imiIhu9u670,How to accept user input in C++? ⌨️,2022-04-19T23:19:39Z,all right let's get started everybody in this video i'm going to show you how we can accept some user input in c plus plus we're familiar with c out followed by the insertion operator which is two left angle brackets well to accept some input we would type c in for character input followed by the extraction operator which is two right angle brackets here's a demonstration let's ask a user for their name i'll create a string variable string the name will be well name then i'll create a prompt which will ask the user what their name is standard output insertion operator what's your name then to accept some user input we would type standard cn for character input extraction operator then where would we like to store the user input let's store it within our variable name at the end of our program let's display what the user's name is standard output insertion operator hello name okay we're gonna have one problem though if we're using vs code as our text editor we need to begin using the terminal tab previously we've been using output so i can't actually type in anything to this because it's well for output if you're using vs code this is what we'll need to do if you're not you can skip this step we're going to go to file preferences settings look up code runner then we are looking for run in terminal which is right about here check that close this tab let's stop this from running and we'll run it again okay here we go what's your name i'll type in my first name hit enter hello bro or whatever your first name was this time let's ask a user for what their age is i'll store this within a variable named age int age standard output your age standard input extraction operator age standard output insertion operator you are age years old and i think we'll need some new line characters right about here just one okay this should work let's try it what's your name i'll type in my first name hit enter what's your age i'll make up an age i like to think that i'm 21 still hit enter hello bro you are 21 years old so that's how to accept some user input you can use cn for character input uh but there's just one problem though if you type in a string that has spaces well once we hit a space we stop reading that string this time let's ask a user to type in their full name okay type in your first name and your last name hit enter what's your full name bro code what's your age hello bro you are zero years old if we need to read a string that could contain spaces there's a function that we can use to help us with that that is the get line function standard get line add a set of parentheses within the parentheses we will type standard c in then comma our variable name now we should be able to type in a string including any spaces what's your full name type in your own first name and last name hit enter what's your age i'll type in 21 hello bro code you are 21 years old if you need to accept a string that includes any white spaces you're better off using the getline function and if you forget i'll post this in the comments section so you can always take a look at it if you don't remember okay there's just one issue with this though i'm going to move the second question above the first let's take a look to see what happens what's your age 21 what's your full name hello you are 21 years old here's the issue if we accept some user input with cn followed by get line well in our input buffer there's a new line character and we don't pick up that newline character when we reach the getline function it accepts the newline character that's still within the buffer so to prevent that from happening there's one change that we can make to the getline function after cn add this extraction operator standard ws for any white spaces this portion will eliminate any newline characters or any white spaces before any user input so let's try this again what's your age i'll type in 21 type in your full name and there we go hello bro code you are 21 years old so yeah everybody that's how to accept some user input basically you can just use cn followed by the extraction operator but if you need a string that could include spaces i recommend using the getline function so yeah that's how to accept some user input in c plus if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to accept some user input in c plus plus
Gt2yBZAhsGM,Learn Binary search trees in 20 minutes 🔍,2021-11-10T15:22:47Z,all right what's going on everybody in this video we're going to discuss binary search trees but first we'll need to know what a binary tree is a binary tree is a tree where each node has no more than two children that's why it's binary in this example node one has two children two and three and each of these children have their own children they have no more than two children nodes four and five are the children of two and nodes six and seven are the children of three in this similar example this would also be a binary tree node three only has one child node six but with a binary tree no node has more than two children since node three has one child that's fine but if node three had three children well that would no longer be a binary tree now what makes a binary search tree different from a binary tree is that the values are arranged in a certain order here's the order the root node should be greater than the left child but less than the right child four is greater than two and four is less than six that's the pattern that this data structure is built around if we take a look at some of the subtrees let's say this one two is greater than one but less than three and in this subtree six is greater than five but less than seven if done correctly starting at the root node the leftmost child should be the least value and again starting from the root node the rightmost child should be the greatest value the reason that these nodes are arranged this way is for quick lookup let's say we're looking for five what we'll do is compare 5 to the root node if 5 is equal to the root node well then we found our answer if 5 is greater than our root node we will move down to the right branch and do the same thing again is 5 equal to 6 no it's not however it's less than six so we know to go down at this branch the runtime complexity to find a value within a binary search tree is big of log n in its best case so let's code a binary search tree now okay let's begin let's create a node class file new class i will name this node and finish nodes will have some data maybe an integer this time int data and the node class should contain at most two nodes node left for the left child and node right for the right child if a node is a leaf node well then these will be null but we would still like to allocate space to hold children and within the constructor we will pass in some data int data and assign it this dot data equals data now let's create a binary search tree class file new class binary search tree and within our main class let's instantiate a binary search tree object binary search tree i'll name this tree equals new binary search tree and within the binary search tree class each binary search tree should have a root node node root here are some methods we'll need an insert method to insert nodes public void insert and there is a parameter of a node node node now let's create a second method this next method will be a helper method of the insert method so the insert method is going to call its helper method and this will be private the return type is node insert helper we need a root node node root and a node node node in order for our program to compile we do need to return something so just as a placeholder i'm going to return null okay for the next method we need a display method public void display and helper method private void display helper and this has one parameter a root node node root next method is a search method public boolean we're returning a boolean search and the parameter is int data and we will need a helper method private boolean search helper there are two parameters node root and int data again we do need to return something i'm going to return false just as a placeholder okay next method is a remove method public void remove and the parameter is int data and we'll need a helper method the return type is node remove helper the two parameters are node root and int data we do have to return something so as a placeholder i'm going to return null our remove helper method is also going to rely on two separate methods one to find a successor and another to find a predecessor this is in case we're deleting nodes we have to shift nodes around so this will be private int successor and we will pass in node route and we need to return something let's return zero as a placeholder and let's copy this paste it and this will be a method predecessor and that will be it so let's close these for now and begin with the insert method so with the insert method we will assign our root node equal to insert helper method pass in our root node and a node so the reason that we're using helper methods is that we'll be using recursion so it's a lot easier to use recursion if you have a helper method within the insert helper method let's declare int data equals our nodes data node is the node that we're passing in to insert so let's check to see if our root node is assigned or not so if our root is equal to null then we should probably assign this node to the root node because well this is the first node root equals node return root if root is not null we have to compare the data to see if it's less than a root or greater than our root else if our data is less than the data of the root node then we are going to assign this node as the left child of our root node are roots left child root dot left equals and we will use recursion insert helper method pass in our roots left node and our node the root node is going to change with recursion at first it's going to be the root node of the entire tree after recursion we're examining the root node of a subtree so if we're passing in the left child of the original root node well then that left child is now the root node of a subtree that we're currently working with so else if the data is less than the current root node we go left if it's greater than the root node then we will go right else root dot right that's the right child equals insert helper method pass in root dot write and our node and it's the same process all over again and at the end we will return the current root node okay that is it for the insert method and the insert helper method so let's insert a few nodes although we can't yet display them let's insert some anonymous nodes tree dot insert and we can pass in a node either a node name or an anonymous node so let's pass in some anonymous nodes uh let's pass in the number five or some other number of your choosing and let's pass in a bunch of numbers how about one and nine make sure these are not in order seven and three six four and maybe one more eight if you run and compile this there is nothing obvious that really happens so let's work on a display method next so with the display method we will invoke our helper method display helper pass in the root node within the display helper method we're going to check to see if the root node of our subtree does not equal null so if root does not equal null if you would like to display these in order we can use in order traversal and that uses recursion so invoke the display helper method pass in the root child's left node root dot left if we're using recursion the first piece of data that's displayed is the least value and these values will be displayed in increasing order technically the term is non-decreasing but think of it as ascending order so the very first value is going to be the least one followed by the root node of this subtree system.out.printline root.data in our first subtree the data all the way to the left is one and the root node of that subtree is two then we need the right child which should theoretically be three so again we'll invoke the display helper method and pass in the right child so this is in order traversal all of the nodes will be displayed in non-decreasing order so let's try this at the end of our main class let's invoke tree dot display and see what happens yeah there we go all of the nodes within our binary search tree are now in order if you would like this in reverse order you can just change these methods around replace left with right and right with left and these are now in decreasing order but let's change that back okay up next we have the search methods okay search will return then invoke the search helper method pass in our root node as well as some data within the search helper class we'll check to see if root is equal to null that means our tree is empty so of course we can't search for anything return false then add else if our root dot data is equal to data that means we found the data that we're looking for there's a match then we're going to return true we found what we're looking for else if our roots data is greater than our current data that we're looking for that means we need to go left so return then invoke the search helper method pass in the left child root dot left and the left child is now the root node of the subtree and then you need to pass in data as well else we go right so copy this paste it return search helper root dot write and data and we can get rid of this return statement at the bottom okay let's try this so at the end of my main class let's use a print line statement and i will type tree dot search and let's search for zero none of my nodes have zero as a piece of data so this should return false uh let's search for one now that returns true there's a one within one of my nodes what about nine that is also true and let's try ten and that is false okay so those are the search methods and lastly we have the remove methods as well as successor and predecessor now these methods are going to be a little bit tough but i'll try my best to explain it so within an if statement let's check to see if this data even exists first so let's invoke the search method and pass in our data so this returns a boolean true or false if we do find the data that we're looking for then let's invoke the remove helper method pass in our root node as well as our data then within an else statement and this part's optional uh let's let the user know that we can't find that data data plus could not be found so just to test things real quick i'm going to remove some data that doesn't exist tree dot remove zero zero cannot be found now let's move on to the remove helper method the first thing that we'll do is check to see if our root node is equal to null if our root node is equal to null then let's return the root node then within an else if statement let's check to see if the data that we're trying to remove is less than the data of our root node if it is we need to go left down the binary tree root dot left equals then invoke the remove helper method pass in the left child of the root node root.left as well as our data so we're going to go as far left as we can then add an else if statement else if data is greater than the data of the root node then we will go right so let's copy this paste it root dot write equals remove helper pass in root dot right as well as our data then add an else statement if we reach the else statement that means that we have found our node and i'll just add a note to explain that if the node we're trying to remove has children that kind of complicates things then we have to shift the nodes around but first let's check to see if it's a leaf node then that's really easy within an if statement we will check to see if the left child is equal to null and the right child is also equal to null that means that the node that we're trying to remove is a leaf node and that's really simple we don't need to shift any nodes around we can just set this current root node equal to null however if the node we're attempting to delete has a right child will have to shift those nodes around and find a successor else if root dot right does not equal no that means there's a right child and we need to find a successor to replace this node so we will assign root dot data is equal to the successor method which will find a successor for us and pass in the current root node then take root dot write equals and invoke the remove helper method pass in the right child root.right as well as root.data so when we delete a node that will create a gap and if there's a child well we don't want that child to be lost we don't want that child to become an orphan so we will link a child to that spot where we deleted a node now if there's a left child we have a slightly similar procedure so we can use an else statement take root.data and invoke the predecessor method take this line of code paste it root dot left equals remove helper method pass in the left child of the root node this else statement will find a predecessor to replace this node and at the end we will return root so we can close out of these two methods and we can open up the successor and predecessor methods what we're doing with the successor method is that we're attempting to find the least value below the right child of this root node we will assign the current root node equal to root dot right then within a while loop we will take root dot left and check to see if it is not equal to null while this condition is true take root set the sequel to root dot left and at the end return root dot data so what's happening here within the remove helper method if the node we're trying to delete has a right child we need to find a successor to fill in that gap and that successor should have the least value so we will go right and look as far left as we can because values on the left are less than the root numbers on the right are greater than our root after going right we will go as far left as we can to get the lowest value then return it so that's what we're doing when we're assigning a successor to fill in that gap when we delete a node that has children and then the predecessor method is going to be very similar we will find the greatest value below the left child of this root node so we can copy all of this paste it this time we will go left then go as far right as we can go i do apologize this is a lot to take in recursion can be very confusing but yeah that's everything let's attempt to remove a node so before we display our tree let's take tree dot remove then pass in the data of a node you would like to remove let's remove one and here are the remaining nodes we have two through nine all in order let's remove five okay one two three four six seven eight nine let's remove nine nine is no longer there and let's remove a node that is not within here like zero zero cannot be found all right then everybody that is a binary search tree just so you're aware the order in which you insert nodes into a binary search tree does matter if it's unbalanced technically my tree follows all the rules however it's fairly lopsided there is a way to balance binary trees but that's a topic for avl trees that's why the runtime complexity has a best case scenario of o of log n but a worst case scenario of big o of n depending on how balanced it is but basically a binary search tree is a tree data structure where each node is greater than its left child but less than its right the benefit of a binary search tree is that it's easy to locate a node when they are in order so yeah those are binary search trees if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below don't be afraid to smash that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe

7z_HXFZqXqc,Learn Priority Queue data structures in 5 minutes 🥇,2021-10-17T19:13:46Z,hey yeah everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to discuss priority queues in computer science so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey uh what's going on everybody so priority queues a priority queue is a fifo data structure first in first out however a major difference with priority queues is that before we start polling and serving elements we put them in some sort of order higher priority elements are served first before elements with lower priority so here's an example let's say that we have some student gpas and we'll place them all within a queue and then a priority queue and take a look at the differences so let's create a queue the data type is q and we are going to insert some doubles some gpas i'll name this queue equals new now queues are actually interfaces and we can't implement them directly so we need to use a class that utilizes the queue interface one that i know of is a linked list then finish instantiating it now to add data to a queue we use the offer method q dot offer and then pass in a gpa let's make sure that these are not in order uh how about a 3.0 then the next student has a let's say 2.5 then a 4.0 1.5 and 2.0 okay now let's display the elements of our queue one easy way in which we can do that is to use a while loop and this is our condition we'll continue this while not logical operator q dot is empty method while our q is not empty pull each element and display it so within a print line statement let's use hue dot poll to display and remove each element beginning with the first one and then working our way to the end so this will display the elements within my queue so these are in first come first serve order whatever element we were offered first we are serving that element first if an element was added last well then it's served last so that's a standard queue now with a priority queue we're going to arrange them in some sort of order before we actually pull these elements so let's change our linked list to a priority queue and run this again and let's take a look at the differences okay these are all in order now so if we're working with numbers like doubles these are arranged in ascending order beginning with the smallest element let's pretend that these are grade point averages gpas why might we want to put these in order let's say whatever student performed the worst gets two hours of free tutoring whichever student performed second worst gets one hour of free tutoring and third gets half an hour free tutoring now if you need these in descending order well there's one change that we're going to make within the constructor we can pass in a comparator but that's a little advanced for us and we haven't discussed that yet so there is a default comparator that we can use found within collections collections dot reverse order method so these elements will be in reverse order then in this example let's say that whichever student has the best gpa will receive i don't know a gold medal like the olympics and the second best student will receive a silver medal then a bronze medal and then every student after that i guess will receive nothing but that's okay though they got some free tutoring in the last example okay now let's change the data type let's say that these are now strings and let's put these in standard order so let's change these two strings maybe this student has a b this one has a c a f and what are we missing d if we have a priority queue of strings well then these elements will be in alphabetical order so if we need these in reverse alphabetical order again we can pass in a comparator and then one that we can use is from collections collections dot reverse order and these elements within our priority queue are now within reverse alphabetical order so yeah that's a priority queue think of it like a queue however we first sort these elements based on a certain priority we will pull and serve the elements with the highest priorities first and work our way to elements with lower priority so yeah that's a priority queue if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are priority queues in computer science
246V51AWwZM,Learn Linear Search in 3 minutes ⬇️,2021-10-16T19:36:57Z,all right everybody linear searches we need to talk about linear searches because this wouldn't be a complete course without them with a linear search we iterate through a collection one element at a time the runtime complexity of a linear search is big o of n the larger the data set the number of steps to complete that search will increase proportionately the disadvantages of a linear search is that they are slow for large data sets but with the advantages they are fast for searches of small to medium sized data sets and they don't need to be sorted that's a huge benefit over binary searches and interpolation searches and they are useful for data structures that do not have random access such as linked lists so let's begin let's create a basic array of integers int array and to make up some numbers they don't necessarily need to be in order all right then let's find an index int index equals and we will invoke a linear search function which we still need to declare we will pass in our array and some value we would like to search for uh let's search for the number one okay so then let's declare this function create method linear search private static and linear search so we have two parameters an integer array and an integer i'm going to rename i as value so it's more descriptive okay with a linear search all we need to do is loop through our array one element at a time so we can do that with the for loop so let's set into i our index equal to zero we will continue this as long as i is less than our arrays length then increment i by one what we're checking with an if statement is to see if our array at index of i is equal to the value that we're searching for this parameter if it is then let's return whatever our index is i if we do not find it after iterating through our entire array let's return negative 1 as a sentinel value and that's all there is to it to our linear search function so back within our main function let's check to see if the value returned does not equal negative one that means that we found our value so with an if else statement let's check to see if index does not equal negative one that means that we have found our element so let's print element found at index plus index else let's print element not found system.out.printline element not found so if we're searching for the number one we would find that at index one zero one if we search for five that is found at index eight zero one two three four five six seven eight if there's some number that's not in here like 10 then this will print element not found so yeah that's the idea behind a linear search we iterate through some collection one element at a time it's slow for large data sets but it's fast for small to medium data sets this would be a small data set and they do not need to be sorted that's a huge advantage so yeah everybody that is a linear search if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that is a basic linear search in computer science i guess
87SH2Cn0s9A,C Programming Full Course for free ⚙️,2021-10-07T14:00:10Z,all right what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can get started writing code in c so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i'm going to tell you why you need to learn c c is a middle level language that originated in the 1970s and it is one of the most widely used programming languages to date on a spectrum of high-level languages to low-level languages c is a middle level language low-level languages are efficient they work closely with machine architecture they consume less memory and they're fast as however they're difficult to understand and it takes more time to write code that's in a low level format high-level languages are easier to work with easier to understand they allow for more abstraction but they're slower they use more memory and they're abstract so it's difficult to work with low level hardware and systems a major advantage of middle level languages is that they can act as a bridge between high-level software and applications as well as low-level hardware and embedded systems most compilers kernels and operating systems are written in c nearly all programming languages are influenced by c in some way c is what provided many of the original programming concepts such as variables data types loops arrays functions etc in fact the python language is written with c the default implementation is known as c python if you're already familiar with the programming language learning c will give you an even deeper understanding of how those operate c is literally everywhere from databases to self-driving cars operating systems to embedded systems it's been around for so long and used for so many purposes here are some important notes before we get started c is not an object-oriented language it's procedural not abstract c plus plus is an object-oriented extension of c if you know c you already know some c plus plus however c is a difficult language for beginners don't get discouraged you can do it so what you'll need you'll need an ide an integrated development environment which is basically a fancy text editor to help us write c code as well as a gnu compiler collection which we abbreviate to simply gcc this compiles or otherwise converts c code to machine code you know all those ones and zeros that a machine can read let's begin by downloading an ide i recommend vs code it's flexible and you can use vs code for more than just c all right what you're gonna do is head to code.visualstudio.com and then look for this drop down menu to install for your operating system i'm running windows i'm going to install for windows and then i will simply just open when done okay accept the license agreement next you can create a desktop icon and add to path next then install and then give it a second or a couple minutes then you can launch this if you prefer i think i will okay we are now within visual studio head to the left hand menu for extensions we're going to install two extensions c c plus plus that contains intellisense and a couple other useful things so install that and then next we will install code runner code runner install after installing these extensions you may need to restart vs code okay then we are going to add a new folder go to the left-hand menu add folder i'll create a new folder on my desktop so i'll right click go to new folder i'll name this c files then add i think you might have to click within the folder okay we now have a folder named c files then to create a new c file go to new file after clicking this folder i'll name this hello world and make sure that it ends with the c extension helloworld.c and we now have a c file that we can work with and on this tab at the top this says hello world dot c now the next thing that we'll need is that gcc compiler to convert c code to machine code now if you're running windows this is how to check to see if you have a gcc compiler already installed so you're going to open command prompt and enter this command g plus plus dash dash version i already have a gcc compiler already installed if you're getting an error then you'll probably have to download one here's an interruption from future bro i traveled from the future to the past to deliver you this message so if you need to install gcc on a mac operating system what you're going to do within a terminal window is enter the following command c lang dash dash version if c lang isn't installed enter the following command xcode dash select dash dash install and that's all there is to it if you need additional assistance you can always visit this webpage code.visualstudio.com docs slash cpp and if you're running on linux within a terminal window you'll enter this command instead gcc dash v if gcc isn't installed run this command sudo apt-get update and then next type in this long command and if you need any additional assistance or documentation you can always visit this webpage so google this min gw dash w64 install.exe and the first link is for sourceforge so click on that then you can find this underneath home browse development compilers mingw64 for 32 and 64-bit windows and the download should start automatically so click next change the architecture to x8664 next and then copy this path for the destination folder it's going to be relevant later then next next and finish now what we're going to do is add our path to our gcc underneath environment variables so open up control panel then go to system and security then system scroll down to advanced system settings underneath the advanced tab go to environment variables underneath path we are going to edit i already have this path configured so i'm going to delete this you probably won't have this setup and then new paste that file path to the gcc compiler then add slash min 64 slash bin then okay okay and then you can close out of everything and now we need to configure our build task so go to a terminal your default build task if nothing appears within the search box you may need to restart vs code i think i do so i'm going to restart it and then let's try that again terminal configure default build task and there it is i will select that this creates a json file that tells vs code how to compile the program and with that out of the way we can begin coding now before we do start coding anything i'm going to increase the font size because as you can see this font size is really small so within vs code to change the font size go to file preferences settings and you can change that here let's try maybe 20. you can also change the font family too if you want and everything uh but let's close out of that and try that again okay that isn't too bad i'll stick with this font size for now i also recommend enabling autosave that's going to save you a lot of headaches later in the future so go to file auto save okay the first thing that we're going to include within our c program is the word hashtag include so this is a pre-processor command that tells the compiler to include the contents of a file and the file that we would like to include is within angle brackets std for standard io input output dot h this file contains some useful functions related to input and output so we'll need that now the entry point of our program is the main function type int main parentheses curly braces anything within our main function is read procedurally starting from the top and working its way down so anything within this set of curly braces is within the main function and at the end of our main function we're going to add the statement return 0 semicolon a semicolon is used to terminate statements kind of like a period at the end of a sentence at the end of our main function we have this return zero statement this returns the exit status of our program we return a zero if our program runs successfully with no errors if there is an error then we'll return a 1. so now we can add anything that we want within this main function but we'll need return 0 at the end to check for any errors so let's print something to our console as output so to display something we're going to type print f parentheses semicolon because we end our statements with a semicolon and within the parentheses add a set of double quotes because we would like to literally print something and you can type in whatever you want let's say i like pizza then to run this code you can either right click then go to run code alternatively there is a run code button in the top right corner of the s code so after running this code this displays my output i like pizza so what if i would like to add a second line well i would just follow these steps again so i need another printf statement print f parentheses semicolon any text i would like to display i'll place that within a set of double quotes this time let's add a second line i like pizza it's really good and then save all right and this is what this looks like i like pizza it's really good so this is all one long line what if i would like my second line of text on the next line well i can add an escape sequence for a new line character so at the end of my printf statement within the double quotes i'll add backslash n for a new line character and let's try that again so i'm going to clear my output make sure i save and then run this again i like pizza it's really good and then we have that extra space at the bottom because we added an additional new line character which is optional also take notice too that we have this message exited with code equal zero so if there are no errors and your program runs successfully this function will return zero if there is an error well then this will return one so let's misspell something let's say instead of printf we just have print so save and then run this again okay it looks like we have an error exited with code equals one all right people well that's your first c program in the next video we'll cover escape sequences and comments i'll post this code to the comments section down below and pin it to the top if you would like a copy for yourself but yeah that is your first c program hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] all right everybody welcome back in this video i'm going to show you all how we can compile and run a c program using command prompt in my text editor i have a simple c program that prints i love pizza it's really good what we'll need to do is open command prompt now before we begin we should make sure that we have a gcc compiler and to check that just type gcc minus minus version and it looks like i have one so if you're missing a gcc compiler check the first video in the series and i'll show you how to download one now step one to compiling a c file is that we need to change our active working directory so that it's pointing to the folder containing our c file an easy way to change that is that we need the file location so i'm going to right click on my c file go to properties copy this location and within command prompt i will type cd to change directory and then paste that location so our current active directory is pointing to that folder containing our c file and to compile a c file you type gcc the name of the file and mine is hello world dot c then hit enter so nothing appears to happen and that's good so let's take a look at the c folder again this is the file that we compiled it is an executable and all we have to do is run that so that is the third step a exe enter i love pizza it's really good so yeah that's how to compile and run a c file in command prompt first make sure that you have a gcc compiler that would be i guess step zero step one is to change the active working directory to the folder containing your c file compile the c file with gcc the name of the file and then run the compiled file a.exe so yeah that is how to compile and run a c file with command prompt if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey y'all what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain to both comments and escape sequences in c so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right welcome back so we have to discuss comments and escape sequences so a comment is some text that is ignored by the compiler that is used as an explanation description or a note for yourself or anyone else reading over your code so try to comment you will type two forward slashes then anything afterwards is considered a comment and will be ignored by the compiler this is a comment blah so if i was to run this this text will be ignored by the compiler and we do not see that as output i tend to use a lot of comments when explaining things so this is something you'll see fairly often in my videos now if you need a multi-line comment this is only for a single line comment if i was to type this again without those forward slashes this is a comment well our program thinks that this is some sort of code if we need a multi-line comment you will instead type forward slash asterisk then anything after is considered a comment you can see that this is all green now anything up to a asterisk and forward slash will be a multi-line comment this is a multi-line comment and again this is ignored by the compiler so if you need to write a note description or explanation for yourself or for somebody else you can write that within a single line comment or a multi-line comment and i use a lot of these for teaching purposes because i have a lot of explaining to do right okay let's move on to part two of this video we have escape sequences an escape sequence is a character combination consisting of a backslash followed by a letter or combination of digits they specify actions within a line of text otherwise known as a string so we learned in the last video that we can end our printf statement with a backslash n to create a new line this is the escape sequence for a new line and within a string of text a line of text and within a string of text we can add a new line wherever we want and as many as we want let's say that after each word within my line of text i would like to add each word to a new line so i can use the escape sequence for new line after each of these words so that would look like this i like pizza but you may have to work on the spacing though that's a little bit better so wherever you place a backslash n that will create a new line character another escape sequence is backslash t for a tab so let's say i have a few numbers here one two three and i would like to create even spacing between these numbers i can just add an escape sequence for a tab character one backslash t two backslash t and these numbers are spaced evenly or i can get really fancy and add a new line character then maybe a four tab five tab six new line character then maybe a7 tab 8 tab and then a 9. so now we have a grid of numbers all spaced evenly so that is the new line escape sequence and the tab escape sequence you can use them wherever and however many you want within a string of text within a printf statement what if we need to display quotes like we're quoting somebody i like pizza this is a quote from abraham lincoln probably i need to place quotes around i and pizza so if i were to write it like that well our program doesn't know where our string of text begins and ends it's kind of confused if we need to literally print double quotes we will add an escape sequence backslash then double quote and then add that here as well so this allows us to literally print some quotes as i'll put i like pizza abraham lincoln probably or if you need to display single quotes backslash single quotes so that's how to display single quotes and if you need to display a backslash that would be double backslashes this will literally print backslashes so yeah those are just a few escape sequences here's a list of a bunch of them but a lot of these really aren't going to be relevant to us so yeah those are comments and escape sequences and see if you found this video helpful please be sure to destroy that like button drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey yeah it's you bro hope you're doing well and yeah we're doing stuff with variables today in c so sit back relax and well enjoy the show welcome back to another video so variables variables are allocated space and memory to store a value we refer to a variable's name to access the stored value that variable now behaves as if it was the value that it contains but to create a variable we first need to declare a name for a variable and then precede it with the type of data that we are storing creating a variable is done in two steps declaration and initialization so we need to first declare a variable to allocate some space in memory to store a value so we need to precede our variable name with the data type of what we plan on storing within this variable if i need to store a whole integer we would precede our variable name withint int for integer and let's say that this is variable x so this step is declaration we are creating space and memory to store a value and to actually store a value that step is initialization so we would take our variable name x in this example and set it equal to some value so we declared that this variable is an integer we can only store whole integers maybe the number one two three so this is initialization or you could combine these steps together and let's create into y into y equals 3 2 1. this is both declaration and initialization so creating and storing a variable takes two steps declaration and initialization and in order to create a variable you have to precede the variable name with the data type of what you plan on storing within that variable int for a whole integer but there's other data types too let's create some more variables what about int age with variable names you're not limited to only just x and y you can really name it whatever you want within some limitations but make sure that the variable name is descriptive of what it does so age is going to store an edge let's say that i am 21 years old so this is an integer a whole number if we need a number containing a decimal portion that would be a float for floating point number so one example of a variable that could contain a floating point number is a gpa grade point average let's say that my grade point average is a 2.05 so this is a floating point number it's a number that contains a decimal portion we can also store single characters with the char data type like you're pronouncing charizard and this will be a letter grade let's say now to store a single character we have to place it within single quotes when we initialize it with my grade variable what about a c like my average grade is a c remember everybody c's get degrees so char stores a single character now c isn't an object-oriented language so there is no string data type because strings are technically objects so if we would like to store like somebody's name we need a series of characters so we can create what is called an array and to create an array we would follow our variable name with a set of square brackets and then assign this equal to some string of text some series of characters place your series of characters within double quotes and we can store more than one character so this data type would be technically an array of characters i'll create a whole separate video on arrays this is basically how you can emulate a string it's really just a whole combination of single characters there's still a lot more data types than just these four i thought i would cover just some of the more basic data types just because in this video we're going to focus more on variables than data types i'm planning a separate video just dedicated to data types because there's way more data types than just these four there's bytes there's doubles there's longs etc now how can we display the value stored within a variable within a printf statement here's how we have to use what is referred to as a format specifier let's say we have a printf statement and i would like to display my age within a message so let's create some text you are age years old if i would like to display the value contained within my edge variable wherever i would like to insert that value i will place a format specifier which is represented by a percent sign and then follow this with a secret character that represents the data type of what we're inserting so if i need to display my age variable i will use a percent sign as a placeholder followed by d for decimal and then after my string of text outside of the double quotes add comma then the name of the variable you would like to insert at this placeholder so at this location i will insert age and then let's try this you are 21 years old so let's try that again with a different variable let's say let's go with name i'll add a second printf statement print f and then let's say hello and i would like to insert my name here so use a percent sign as a placeholder it's a format specifier then to display a character array that would be s for string and then add comma name oh then we may need to add a new line character to the end of these because i forgot let's try that again hello bro you are 21 years old okay let's display our grade printf then within quotes your average grade is then to display a character variable that would be percent c for character then outside of our double quotes add comma the name of the variable we would like to insert at this location so comma grid i think i'm just going to space these out a little bit okay then i will add a new line character to the end of this okay hello bro you are 21 years old your average grade is c then to display a float that would be percent f print f your gpa is percent f then i'll add a new line character so follow this with comma the name of the variable gpa okay your gpa is 2.05 so later on we'll discuss more about format specifiers there's ways that we can format how our variables are displayed i just realized that i misspelled average twice so yeah those are variables they are allocated space and memory to store a value we refer to a variable's name to access the stored value that variable now behaves as if it was the value that it contains but to declare a variable we have to state what type of data that we are storing within that variable so yeah those are variables if this video helped you out help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right what's going on people let's discuss more about data types we discussed a few in the last video but there's a few more that you should be made aware of so chars they store a single character and use the percent c format specifier to display a single character there's an array of characters which can store one or more characters then to display that you use percent s as the format specifier floats they will store a decimal number and we use the percent f format specifier to display a floating point number and then we have integers which only store a whole integer there is no decimal portion and we use percent d to display an integer now along with floats we have doubles doubles have double the precision of a float we can store even more significant digits floats use four bytes of memory they have 32 bits of precision and we can store between six to seven significant digits doubles they have eight bytes of memory double that of floats and they have 64 bits of precision and we can store between 15 to 16 significant digits with my float and my double i'm storing the first several digits of pi i'm going to attempt to display as many digits of pi as i can with a float so i'm going to display these so to display a float use percent f and lf for a double which means long float now by default when i use printf to display a floating point number or a double this will only display the first six to seven digits but we can actually change that we'll discuss more about these in the next video on format specifiers if i would like to display even more digits after the decimal i will add zero point and the amount of digits i would like to display so i would like to display 15 digits after my decimal and i'll do that for my double as well so after the percent signed 0.1 f then add lf and let's take a look at these numbers okay after my two which is i believe the sixth digit after the decimal we actually lose our precision these numbers are not the same but our double will actually retain these numbers so point being a double is even more accurate than a floating point number there is more precision but it uses more memory a double uses eight bytes of memory because of this reason we tend to use doubles a lot more than floats just because they're more precise we don't want to lose our precision next up we have booleans to work with booleans and c include this at the top std bool.h booleans store true or false so they work in binary one represents true and zero represents false so when you need to declare a boolean variable you type bool then a variable name and you set it equal to true or false technically we only need one bit to represent true or false one for true and zero for false but this still uses up one byte of memory and then to display a boolean you can use percent d so if i was to display this boolean variable i would use percent d so one corresponds to true and zero corresponds to false although there are some tricks that we can do in the future where we could display the word to true or the word false but for now we're going to stick with percent d as the format specifier so these work in binary one for true zero for false now another thing that we can do with chars is that we can store a whole integer between the range of negative 128 to positive 127. so in this example we have char f and i will store the integer number 100 we can display this number as either a decimal an integer or a character so if i was to display this number as a character we will use the ascii table to convert this number to a character representation the ascii table has a range between 0 to 127 so if i was to display this number as a decimal using the percent d format specifier of course this will display as 100 but if i was to convert this to a character using the percent c format specifier this has a corresponding character and that would be lowercase d so i'm actually going to change this to something else what about i don't know uh 120 so let's see what the character representation of that number is and that would be a lowercase x so you can use chars to store more than single characters you can also use them to store a whole integer however the range is between negative 128 to positive 127 because they have one byte of memory now there is a keyword unsigned so when you declare a variable that is unsigned we disregard any negative numbers so effectively this doubles our range with our positive numbers so if we have unsigned char we can store a number between 0 to positive 255 because we know we're not going to store a negative number so then if you need to display an unsigned character we can use just percent d i'm going to store 255 within my unsigned chart and that would be of course 255. however if we go beyond this range this will overflow and go back to zero so if i was to display this we have a warning unsigned conversion from int to unsigned chart so then this resets back to zero so if you go beyond the maximum range this will reset all the way back to zero whatever the beginning is so if you add this keyword unsigned you can effectively double the range of positive numbers that you can store within a variable by default most data types are already signed but we don't need to explicitly type that so point being with chars you can store more than a single character you can store a whole integer between ranges negative 128 to positive 127 if it's signed if it's unsigned you can store numbers between 0 to 255. you can display them as an integer by using the percent d format specifier or you could convert them to a character using the ascii table by using the percent c format specifier next we have short hints short ins use two bytes of memory they can store a number between negative 32 768 to positive 32 767 because while they use two bytes of memory they can only store a number so large and if it's an unsigned short int the range is instead between 0 to 65 535 and we use the percent d format specifier to display a short in so within my printf statement i'm going to display these two numbers so i will display variable h and i h is a short integer and i is an unsigned short integer so these are the maximum values for a short integer and an unsigned short integer and like i discussed with chars if we go beyond this range we will encounter an overflow so i'm going to change this short end to 32768 and let's see what number displays so this will overflow and reset this value back to the minimum value which in this case is negative 32 768 and if you do the same thing with the unsigned short integer that would be zero because that's the minimum value for an unsigned short integer so those are short integers they use two bytes of memory and they can store numbers between these ranges depending if it's signed or unsigned oh and another way of writing these you don't necessarily need to declare these with the word and you could just say short and that would do the same thing people usually just call them shorts instead of short ants so those are what shorts are now with integers we kind of discussed this in the last video just briefly integers store a whole number between just under negative 2 billion to just over positive 2 billion because they use 4 bytes of memory and we use the percent d format specifier to display a signed integer if that integer is unsigned the range changes from 0 to just over positive 4 billion however there is a different format specifier to display an unsigned integer you instead use percent u so then let's display these percent d for a signed integer and percent u for an unsigned integer and these are the maximum numbers and then if i was to exceed the range this again would cause an overflow and reset these numbers back to their minimum values so those are standard integers they use four bytes of memory so they can store numbers between these ranges depending if they're signed or unsigned all right the last data type we're going to talk about for this topic is a long long integer now the reason that we have long twice is that with standard integers these are already considered longs but we don't need to explicitly type long for standard integers so to represent a really large number we can use a long long integer and these use eight bytes of memory the effective range for a signed long long integer is just underneath nine quintillion to just over nine quintillion and the format specifier for a long long integer one that is signed is percent lld now if it's unsigned that changes the range between zero to just over positive 18 quintillion and the format specifier is percent llu then let's display these so for a signed long long integer that is lld and if it's unsigned that is llu now we'll encounter a warning so this warning applies to our unsigned long long integer integer constant is so large that it is unsigned so one way in which we can prevent that warning is after our number within our unsigned long long integer add a u to the end of this so then we can display this number with no warning so since long long integers use so many bytes they can store a gigantic number we tend to not use long long integers very often because well we don't really have a need for this large of a number but in certain circumstances you might perhaps you're dealing with the speed of light or something you may need to use a long long integer but commonly we use standard integers a lot more well yeah everybody those are even more c data types we likely won't be using most of these but you should still be made aware of their existence i would say that we're going to focus on chars array of chars doubles booleans and integers so pay attention to those ones but you should still be made aware of the existence of other data types just in case you encounter them if you found this video helpful please smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you while a few extra things that we can do with format specifiers using a format specifier within a printf statement we can define and format a type of data to be displayed to use a format specifier you use a percent sign then follow that percent sign with a certain character depending on the type of data you would like to display let's say that we have three variables maybe we have an online store or something like that so let's say that these are of the float data type and we'll have three items for sale item one and make up some price let's say that the first item is five dollars and seventy five cents and we have item two and this will be ten dollars even and then we have item three and this will be one hundred dollars and ninety nine cents so let's display item one item two in item three with a print f statement print f and within a string let's say item one colon space then i'll add a dollar sign wherever you would like to insert a value or variable you will use that format specifier the percent sign so after my dollar sign i'll add item one so that would be percent then for floats you need f and then after the string add comma item one then let's just make sure that this works so we're going to be formatting this output what if we don't want all the zeros we can set the decimal precision of a float or double after the format specifier add a dot and the amount of digits you would like to display if i would only like to display two digits after the percent i will add point two and this will only display two digits for the amount of cents that we owe okay now let's do the same thing for items two and three so item two item two item three item three okay then let's add a new line character because i forgot so new line new line and new line much better another thing that we can do with format specifiers is that we can set a minimum field width so just add a number after the percent sign let's say that i would like to allocate eight spaces worth of room to display my number so after the percent sign but before the decimal add how many spaces you would like to set for the minimum field width let's say eight and let's see the new output okay there we go however it's all right aligned if you would like this left aligned you would use a negative sign after the percent to left align all this this would be negative whatever number you would like to allocate so the number is left justified but we still have all of this room after so that's what a format specifier is it defines and formats a type of data to be displayed so place a format specifier within a string use a certain character for the type of dad you would like to display you can set decimal precision for floats and doubles you can set a minimum field width to display your output if you would like to line things up like you can see here and you can left or right align your output so yeah those are format specifiers if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey everyone so i'm going to attempt to explain constants in about a minute a constant is a fixed value that cannot be altered by the program during its execution i have a variable pi pi equals 3.1415 but what if we accidentally or somebody else changes the value of pi it's an important number pi now equals 420 69. since this value was changed this will alter the result of our program to prevent a variable or value from being changed we can turn that variable into a constant by preceding the data type with this keyword const and a common naming convention with constants is that you make all the letters uppercase although it's not necessary but it's considered good practice so if i attempt to take our constant and assign this a different value we'll run into an error error assignment of read-only variable pi that is what a constant is it's a fixed value that cannot be altered by the program during its execution and it provides a little bit of security so if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro well well well welcome back so we need to talk about arithmetic operators because well this wouldn't be a full course without them so as you probably know arithmetic operators are well addition subtraction multiplication division and there's a few others too unique with programming such as modulus increment and decrement so let's go over a few let's say that we have int z and if we need to add two numbers we could say x plus y equals z and then display the sum which of course is seven so subtraction is well minus five minus two is three multiplication is an asterisk five times two equals 10. okay now pay attention to this with division so 5 divided by 2 equals 2.5 right well that's where you're wrong it's 2 because we're storing the result within an integer and with integers we can only store whole numbers so we will lose that decimal portion it will be truncated there's a few things we'll need to change first we'll need to store the result within a float or a double and then let's display this percent f for a float okay another thing that we need to change too and that involves integer division if we're dividing by an integer we'll truncate that decimal portion there's one of two things we can do we can either change our divisor to a float or a double and that will solve that problem 2.5 or if we would like to keep this as an integer we can convert this integer to a float or double by preceding the divisor with float or double either one so if i would like to keep y as an integer and we divide x by y we will convert 2 into a float so 2.0 and store the result within float z and the result is 2.5 so if you're performing division with any integers you need to pay attention to integer division and you may need to cast your divisor as a float or as a double now we have modulus modulus gives you the remainder of any division 5 does not divide by 2 evenly int z equals x modulus y and if we display z so make sure to change your format specifier if you didn't the remainder of five divided by two is one if this was four four divides by two evenly and the result is going to be zero modulus gives you the remainder of any division it's actually pretty helpful to find if a number is even odd all you do is say modulus 2 or some variable containing the value of 2 either way and then we can increment or decrement a number by 1. if i need to increment x for some reason you'll see this when we get to the video on loops i could say x plus plus and then let's display x x incremented by one would be six and then let's decrement y y minus minus and y decremented by one equals one so yeah everybody those are a few arithmetic operators a lot of these are fairly simple you know addition subtraction multiplication and division do pay attention to integer division because that can throw off your program then there's also modulus increment and decrement if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey welcome back everybody here's a super quick video on augmented assignment operators they're used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable now what the heck does that mean okay so let's say that we need to increment the value of x by one without using an increment operator we could say x equals x plus one so writing this out can be somewhat redundant there is a shortcut by using an augmented assignment operator whatever variable you would like to perform an operation on you will list that variable use an arithmetic operator equals and then some value so writing this would increment x by one so let's go over a few examples we have into x equals ten so i could write x equals x plus two to increment x by two right or i could say as a shortcut x plus equals two and that will do the same thing and that's twelve now let's try minus x equals x minus three using the augmented assignment operator that would be x minus equals three which is seven what about x equals x times four well that would be x times equals four x times four is forty and division x equals x divided by five the augmented assignment operator of this equation is x divided by equals five which is two and lastly modulus so what about x equals x modulus two that would be x modulus equals two x modulus two equals zero well yeah everybody those are augmented assignment operators they're basically a shortcut they're used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable it's a shortcut if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey uh welcome back in this video i'm going to show you all how we can accept user input in c now if you're using vs code we need to switch from using our output tab to terminal and one way in which we can make that change is by going to file preferences settings search for code runner and then check this run in terminal so then when we run our code it will now display in terminal which accepts user input output doesn't because well it's only for output and you can ignore this this is a powershell command that will compile and run your c program but if you prefer instead of powershell you can use command prompt but you would need to manually compile and run your code since i'm using windows that would be a gcc the name of your c program hello world dot c that will compile your program into an executable named a dot exe then just type that to run it but i'll stick with using powershell just to kind of simplify things okay now how can we accept user input let's declare a variable age but not yet assign it next we're going to create a prompt to ask the user for their age and we'll ask how old are you to accept user input we can use the scan f function it's kind of the inverse of printf printf is used to display something as output scanf is used to read input what we're going to place within our scanf function is the format specifier of the variable we will insert a value into if we need to accept a number an integer as input the corresponding format specifier is percent d then add a comma the name of the variable but precede the variable name with an ampersand that is the address of operator let's print a message that contains the value stored within our variable edge u are percent d years old so this is our format specifier it functions as a placeholder and i would like to display the value contained within my edge variable so things are getting a little bit difficult to read i'm just going to precede this with a new line okay let's try that again how old are you let's say that i'm 21 not anymore but let's pretend that i still am you are 21 years old that's basically how to accept user input you use the scanf function use the format specifier of the variable list the variable appreciated with the address of operator let's try this again but instead accept a string from a user like a name we need to declare an array of characters and set asides so let's create a character array named name now with character arrays we can't change the size of the array after the program is already running let's set a max size of maybe 25 bytes for this array if we go over this limit this will cause a buffer overflow and let's ask a user for their name so we'll create a prompt printf what's your name and i again will use scanf list the appropriate format specifier for character arrays which is percent s then our variable name and use the address of operator then at the end we'll display our name printf hello percent s how are you then comma name and before we run this i'm just going to add some new line characters just to make everything easier to read okay let's try it what's your name i'll type in just my first name not including any white spaces how old are you 21 hello bro how are you you are 21 years old so now this time let's type in a first and last name because this is going to act a little bit bizarre what's your name bro code and this is separated with the white space hit enter hello bro it did not include my last name how are you you are zero years old so using the scan f function we will read up to any white spaces so if your user input is going to include a white space we need to use a different function and that is the f gets function f gets parentheses and there are three things we will list within the fgets function the name of the variable and we do not need the address of operator that ampersand for this then we need to set an input size i will set this to 25 to match the size of our array and then std in which means standard input so using this function we can read any white spaces what's your name i'll type in a first name and a last name how old are you 21 hello bro code and notice that our output is actually being displayed on the next line that's because when you use the f gets function it will include the new line character when you hit enter if you need to get rid of that new line character at the end so that it's not included with your input here's what we can do it's a little advanced but we'll cover this in future videos we'll include this import include string dot h so using this import we can work with strings all we're going to do is edit our string and get rid of that newline character at the end what i'm about to show you will look a little bit advanced but it's going to make more sense when we get to the video on string functions type the name of the variable followed by a set of straight brackets type str len this gets the length subtract one and we will set the sequel to backslash zero that will get rid of the new line character so again this is a little bit advanced for us but it'll make more sense in future videos when we get to the video on string functions and let's try this one last time what's your name type in a first name and a last name hit enter how old are you 21. hello bro code how are you you are 21 years old if you need to accept a string from a user that includes white spaces like a first name and a last name you'll want to use fgets in place of scanf because scanf can't read those white spaces it stops right there but it will include that new line character when you hit enter so you can do some string formatting just to get rid of that new line character and like i said this statement here will make more sense when we reach the video on string functions but yeah basically that's how you can accept user input you can use the scanf function if you need to accept a string of characters that includes white spaces you'll want to use fgets instead so yeah that's how to accept user input and see if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody so in this video i'm gonna show you some useful math functions in c now if we include this math header file this contains a lot of the useful functions i'm about to show you one useful function is the square root function let's say that we have a bunch of variables we declared them but we have not yet assigned them i will assign a the square root of nine so after including this math header file i have access to a square root function so type sqrt then add a set of parentheses and within the parentheses we can find the square root of a number let's find what the square root of nine is and then display it with a printf statement so the square root of nine is three so let's move on we can raise a base to a given power by using the pow function the first number is the base let's raise two to the power of four and then display it two to the power of four is 16. we can round a number and i will store this within an integer let's round 3.14 oh and then make sure you use the appropriate format specifier for ins 3.14 rounded is 3. now by using the seal short for ceiling function we can always round a number up 3.14 rounded up is 4. likewise there's a floor function where we will always round down 3.99 rounded down is 3. we can find the absolute value of a number that's how far a number is away from zero so it will take any negative numbers and make them positive the absolute value of negative 100 and that would be positive 100 if you're familiar with logarithms we can find the logarithm of a number log 3 is 1.098612 and if you know some trigonometry there's various functions for sine cosine and tangent so what's the tangent of 45 that is supposedly this number 1.619775 so yeah everybody those are a few math functions that you might be interested in to use these just include this header file at the top math.h if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey everyone here's a quick program that we can make to calculate the circumference of a circle i thought this would be good practice for us now that we know how user input works let's declare all of the variables that we'll need i'm going to create a constant variable named pi and it's going to be of the double data type pi equals 3.14159 the reason that i'm making this a constant is that i don't want anybody else to be able to change the value of pi and let's declare but not assign a radius quite yet we'll have the user type that in and double circumference this will be calculated and displayed so we will need to prompt the user to enter in a radius i'll proceed this with a new line enter radius of a circle and then i will use scanf to accept some user input we need to list the format specifier of doubles which is lf comma address of operator radius then the formula for radius is 2 times pi times radius and then we will display our circumference using printf circumference then we need a format specifier we're displaying a double so the format specifier is lf comma circumference and let's run it enter well the radius of a circle uh let's say that our radius is 10 maybe this is 10 i don't know meters all right our circumference is 62.83 meters now why not take this a step further let's also calculate the area of the circle i wasn't planning on taking it this far but hey let's calculate that as well for practice so let's declare a double variable named area and we will calculate what area is the formula for the area of the circle is pi times radius squared pi times radius times radius then let's display the area so area we're using the double format specifier and area then let's add some new line characters to separate everything enter the radius of a circle let's say 10 meters the circumference is 62.83 meters and the area is 314 meters all right everybody that is a small program to calculate the circumference of a circle and i guess the area as well just because well why not so yeah if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro alright welcome back everybody in this video we're going to write a small practice program to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle we'll need the help of our math.h header file because we'll need access to some useful math functions more specifically the square root function let's declare all of the variables that we'll need we'll need sides a b and c and these will be of the double data type a b c we'll ask the user to enter in sides a and b print f enter side a and then we will use scanf so the format specifier for a double is l f then i would like to insert a value within a so i need to use the address of operator then our variable a okay let's do the same thing for side b enter side b and store the user input within variable b the formula to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the square root of a squared plus b squared so we will set c equal to the square root function and within the parentheses we will say a times a plus b times b and then we will display c side c and the format specifier for a double is l f and we are displaying c and well let's try it so side a let's say is three side b is four that means side c is five so yeah i thought that would be a good practice program for us to get used to accepting user input if this video helped you out help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey let's talk about if statements if statements are used to add some choices to a program let's take the small program for example we have a variable edge and we'll ask a user to enter in their edge what if i would like to check their edge maybe they're signing up for a credit card or something so to check some value we can write an if statement if parentheses then a set of curly braces if some condition that we specify is true we will execute some block of code some subsection of code what sort of condition should we write let's check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18. so there's different comparison operators there's greater than or equal to greater than less than less than or equal to or you could check to see if two values are equal by using double equal signs this is the comparison operator if you use just one this is the assignment operator and this would be the same as assigning age equal to 18 so if you need to compare if two values are equal use the comparison operator which is double equal signs but what i would like to do is check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18. if this condition evaluates to be true we will have our program do something so let's print a message since we're signing up for a credit card let's say you are now signed up and let's run it end to your age let's say that i'm 21 i hit enter boom you are now signed up but what if this condition is false let's say that i'm 12 years old and i'm attempting to sign up for a credit card well we skip this if statement if this condition evaluates to be false we will skip this block of code and continue on with the rest of the program ignoring it or we could do something else by using an else statement if this condition is false we will skip this subset of code and instead perform this let's print a different message instead you are too young to sign up and let's try that again and to your edge i am 12. you are too young to sign up you can check more than one condition before reaching your else statement by using else if blocks and that is by using else if statements we can check another statement before reaching our else statement so let's check to see if age is less than zero so obviously somebody's messing with this program then because you can't be under zero years old right you haven't been born yet so after running this program if i say that i'm negative six you haven't been born yet so we will check our if statement first if this condition is false we will move down to the next block and then check this else if condition if all above statements evaluate to be false we will execute this else block as a last resort so to say and with these else if blocks you can add more than one let's check something else just to demonstrate else if what about age is equal to zero and we will print you can't sign up you were just born and to your age i am zero years old you can't sign up you were just born if one of these conditions evaluates to be true we will skip all of these statements that come after then with our else block if all above statements evaluate to be false we definitely execute whatever's within here so yeah those are if statements they add some choice to a program you can check to see if some condition is true if not you can check something else using else if statements you can perform whatever is within an else block and that's optional so yeah those are if statements and see if you found this video helpful please be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right welcome back people switches a switch is a more efficient alternative to using many else if statements it allows a value to be tested for equality against many cases here's an example of where a switch would be useful i have a small program we will tell a user to enter in a letter grade and depending on their grade we will print a custom message if grade equals a will print perfect else if grade equals b will print a different message so on and so forth so it's considered bad practice to use a lot of else if statements a better alternative is to use a switch here's how we can create one type switch parentheses curly braces whatever value you would like to examine for equality placed within the parentheses i would like to examine my grade and now we need to write some cases case and then some value you would like to test for equality so i am comparing characters i will write the character a colon then if these values match we will execute some subset of code kind of like an if statement let's print perfect and then add a break afterwards then you can add another case so case b you did good casey you did okay case d at least it's not an f case f you failed now you can add a default case this functions like an else statement if no other cases match we will execute whatever's within our default case so that means there are no matching letter grades so let's print please enter only valid grades and let's test it enter a letter grade a this will print perfect whatever's within our matching case let's try it again b you did good see you did okay d at least it's not enough f you failed and if there are no matching cases we will execute our default case uh how about w for win please enter only valid grades the reason that we add breaks after each case is so we can break out of our switch and exit let me show you what this looks like if we do not have any breaks now let's say that we have a c letter grade you did okay at least it's not enough you failed please enter only valid grades so the reason that we have breaks is to exit out of our switch if we have a matching case and there are no breaks we will continue executing each case that comes after so it is important to have those breaks if you want to exit out of your switch well yeah that's a switch everybody it's a more efficient alternative to using many else if statements using a few elsif statements is okay but it's considered poor practice to use a lot of them so yeah those are switches if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey uh everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a small program where the user will type in a temperature and we can convert that temperature from fahrenheit to celsius or celsius to fahrenheit so sit back relax and enjoy the show now before we begin this video make sure that you include these two imports at the top we'll be working with string functions and many of them can be found within this import see type dot h so let's declare the variables that we'll need char unit unit will be either c for celsius or f for fahrenheit and float temp short for temperature let's prompt the user to enter in some user input printf is the temperature in f or c and then we will accept some user input so we will be accepting a character so use the appropriate format specifier for characters and we will use the address of operator which is an ampersand unit and then let's use an if statement to check to see if unit is equal to the character c else if unit is equal to f we will use the formula to convert fahrenheit to celsius if it's c celsius to fahrenheit and we should probably add an else statement as well okay let's actually test these right now okay this will only be temporary i'm going to print a message the temp is currently in celsius and with fahrenheit the temperature is currently in fahrenheit so if the user did not type in c or f well then what the heck did they type in so within our else statement let's yell at the user let's say that whatever they entered in is not valid input so format specifier c is not a valid unit of measurement and then we will display whatever the user typed into our unit variable so let's test this is the temperature in f or c so f the temp is currently in f let's try it again is the temperature in f or c see the temp is currently in c okay this time we will not type in f4c how about the word pizza this only accepts the first character p is not a valid unit of measurement here's one situation that we may run into c programs are case sensitive if i type in lowercase f or lowercase c well technically neither of these conditions would be true for example if i type lowercase t c is not a valid unit of measurement to avoid that problem i can take my user input and use the two upper function to make it uppercase or you could set these conditions to check for lowercase characters instead and use the two lower function so let's take our unit variable and i'm going to reassign it after using the to upper function and then pass in our unit to make it uppercase and now if i type in lowercase c or lowercase f this user input will be made uppercase the temp is currently in c so this is optional but i thought it'd be a good thing to add to this program now what we'll work on next depending on the unit there's going to be a different formula a different calculation now we will need the user to enter in the current temperature so let's begin with our if statement if unit is equal to c celsius enter the temp in celsius this time we are accepting a floating point number we will use scanf the format specifier for floating point numbers address of operator temp and then we need to calculate the new temperature after it's converted from celsius to fahrenheit and we will reassign it into the same variable temp temp equals and here's the formula temp times 9 divided by 5 plus 32 and then let's print the temperature printf the temp in fahrenheit is and i'm going to use a format specifier percent f but i would only like to display one digit after the decimal so i will add dot one and then we will insert our temperature temp okay let's try this enter the temperature in f or c currently we only have the celsius portion set up so see enter the temp in celsius how about zero degrees celsius the temp in fahrenheit is 32.0 okay so we know that it's working let's fill out our else if statement else if unit is equal to f and let's copy some of this enter the temp in fahrenheit we will reassign our temperature variable temp equals and here's the formula temp minus 32 times 5 and we will divide all of this by 9. [Music] then let's display the temperature in celsius the temp in celsius is our format specifier then the temp variable is the temperature in f or c this time it is in fahrenheit enter the temp in fahrenheit so 32 degrees in fahrenheit should translate to zero degrees celsius which it is so yeah everybody i thought that would be a useful practice program for us to get used to accepting user input i'll post all of this code from this program in the comments section down below if you would like a copy so if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey yeah what's going on everybody i thought in this video we could create a simple calculator program in c for practice let's begin by declaring all of the different variables that we'll need we'll need a character to store an operator so are we going to add subtract multiply or divide we'll need double num1 double num2 and double result let's ask the user what type of operation they would like to use enter an operator so we can use addition subtraction multiplication or division and we will use scanf to accept some user input if we're accepting a character the format specifier is c and we will use the address of operator the name of our variable we would like to store some user input into then let's accept num1 enter number one then scanf the format specifier for a double is lf num1 okay do the same thing with number two replace one with two then to examine our operator let's use a switch switch and we will examine our operator for any matching cases let's add a default case because i might forget to add this later so if a user does not enter in anything that has a matching case one of these four symbols let's print a message let's say that our operator is not valid our first case will be edition so case addition result equals num1 plus num2 and let's display our result result and the format specifier for a double is lf and then at the end of your case you should break to break out of the switch then we can copy this paste it and then change any plus to minus then do the same thing with multiplication and lastly division and that is it so let's try this enter an operator i would like to add enter number one 4.20 plus 3.14 that is 7.34 and you can limit the amount of digits after the decimal that is displayed if you would like to adjust that with the format specifier with result type dot than the amount of digits you would like to display so i'm just going to go ahead and change that real quick okay so by adding 0.2 to our format specifier this will only display it two digits after the decimal but you can keep it the original way if you'd like okay let's subtract so minus 4.20 minus 3.14 is 1.06 okay multiplication 3.14 times 4.20 is 13.19 and lastly division 3.14 divided by 4.20 is 0.75 and we do have a default case if there are no matching cases let's type in a character besides one of these four symbols how about i don't know a dollar sign unfortunately we still need to enter into numbers and then this states our operator is not valid so yeah everybody that is a very simple calculator program in c if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post a copy in the comment section down below so this calculator can add subtract multiply and divide there are four cases but you can expand upon this if you'd like so yeah everybody that was a very simple calculator program in c hey yeah what's going on people logical operators there are three logical operators we will discuss in the series and or and not but in this video we're going to focus on and first the and logical operator which is represented by two ampersands checks to see if two or more conditions are true here's an example we're going to create a program that will check to see if a given temperature falls within a range so let's say we have a floating point number named temp temp short for temperature and this will equal some number in celsius let's say 25 to begin with so using an if statement let's check to see if temp is greater than or equal to zero if that is true then we will print something the weather is good else the weather is bad okay so temp is 25 therefore the weather is good okay what if our temperature is something extreme like 1000 degrees celsius so technically this condition would still be true the weather is actually not good it's fairly catastrophic so let's check to see if another condition is also true by using the and logical operator we're checking to see if temp is greater than or equal to 0 and some other condition such as temp is less than or equal to 30. so if temp is at 1000 then the weather is bad this condition is true but this one is false using the and logical operator both conditions must be true in order to execute this statement now if our temperature was 25 degrees well then both conditions are true and we will execute this statement the weather is good now you can add more than one condition let's throw in another variable let's say that we have a boolean variable named sunny let's say that it's cloudy outside now if we're working with booleans include this header file at the top stdbool.h then let's add another condition and let's check to see if sunny is equal to true if you're checking the value of a boolean variable you don't necessarily have to type out equals true you can say sunny is equal to one or you can just say sunny because this would contain true or false so this time we are checking to see if temp is greater than or equal to zero and temp is less than or equal to 30 and sunny is true the temp is 25 but sunny equals false therefore we do not execute this statement these first two conditions are true but this one is false and using the and logical operator all conditions must be true now if i set this to be true well then all three of these conditions are true and we will execute this statement the weather is good so yeah that is the and logical operator it is represented by two ampersands it checks to see if two or more conditions are true and one example we used is to check to see if our temperature falls within a certain range so yeah that is the and logical operator in the next video we will discuss the or logical operator so if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey again it's me so we're gonna talk about the or logical operator the or logical operator which is represented by two vertical bars checks if at least one condition is true let's take the small program for example it's kind of similar to the last video so we have a variable named temperature for temperature we will first check if temp is less than or equal to zero if that's true we will print the weather is bad else if temp is greater than or equal to 30 the weather is bad else the weather is good so you know this program does work the weather is good but another way of writing this is that we can use the or logical operator and we can check to see if at least one of two or more conditions is true so let's take this condition get rid of this else if statement so we will check to see if temp is less than or equal to zero or temp is greater than or equal to 30. so if our temperature is negative 1000 degrees celsius then the weather is bad this is true but this is false and using the or logical only one of these conditions needs to be true if both are true that's fine as well or our temperature could be positive 1000 degrees celsius the weather is also bad this is false and this is true and only one of these conditions needs to be true but if our temperature is 25 well neither of these conditions are true at least one condition needs to be true in order to execute the statement so yeah that is the or logical operator it checks to see if at least one condition is true and you can check more than one condition by adding another set of vertical bars for the ore operator so if you found this video helpful please be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave her in a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey yeah let's discuss the notch logical operator which is represented by an exclamation point its purpose is to reverse the state of a condition let's write a small program let's say that we have a boolean variable named sunny and this will be either true or false let's say it's true to begin with so to work with boolean variables include this header file at the top and we will write an if-else statement to check to see if it's sunny outside and print a custom message so if sunny is equal to true then we will print it's sunny outside else it must be cloudy outside so this does work it's sunny outside another way of writing this is that we could say sunny is equal to one because true represents one false represents zero this would also work or you could just say sunny this would work as well so by using the not logical operator this will reverse the state of condition by using the not logical operator we're checking to see if something is not true so if i try this again this program states it's cloudy outside so i think it would be better if we were to switch these print statements around now what we're checking is if it's not sunny if it's not sunny then we will print it's cloudy outside else it's sunny outside it is sunny outside and if i change this to be false well then it's cloudy outside so yeah that's the not logical operator you can just precede a condition or a boolean variable with the not logical operator and that gives you a few more options in the way in which you can write a program so yeah that is the not logical operator if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey yeah what's going on let's talk about functions a function is a small section of code that is executed whenever we call it also known as invoking a function when we compile and run a c program we begin with invoking the main function so here's our task we need to sing three verses of happy birthday for some reason if we are only using the main function we could write it like this this will be the first verse of happy birthday and if i need to sing three verses i could just copy and paste this one section and then paste it two additional times then i'm just going to add a new line character at the end technically this would work but it's considered poor practice to repeat code more than once if you don't have to wouldn't it be better if we write this code once and then simply reuse it well we can by using a function so let's delete two of these verses and we will create a new function so outside of the main function let's declare a new function so for now we're going to type void and then a unique name for this function let's say that it's the birthday function followed by a set of parentheses and then a set of curly braces so i'm going to take any code i would like to repeat and place it within this new birthday function and if i need to invoke this function all i have to do is type the name of the function followed by a set of parentheses i like to think of the parentheses as a pair of telephones talking to each other that's one trick i used to remember that's how to call a function so follow the function name with the set of parentheses and when i invoke this function once we will execute any code within this function once if i need to repeat this code three times i will just have to call this function three times we are calling our birthday function three times and there we go we have invoked this birthday function three times and we have accomplished our goal of singing three verses of happy birthday so basically that's all what a function is it's some subsection of code that is executed whenever you invoke it also known as calling a function a benefit to using functions is that if you think you're going to use some code more than once you can stick it within a function and then to repeat that code you just call the function as many times as you need so yeah those are functions if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below and in the next video we will discuss arguments and parameters so yeah that's the basics of functions in c hey yeah what's going on people so let's talk about arguments and parameters i have a function named birthday which we discussed in the previous video this will print two lines of text happy birthday dear x you are y years old what i would like to do is replace x with a user's name and y with a user's age so here's how we can write a program like that so let's begin by within the main function declaring two variables a character array named name and assign this your first name and an age and this will be of the int data type and let's say that this will be age and make up some age i like to think that i'm still 21 years old okay so if i try and display a name and age you think this would work right so i'm going to use a format specifier then s to display a string and then i will display our name variable and with y let's display our age so let's use d for our format specifier to display an integer and we will display age now here's the problem you can see that we have some red underlines name is undeclared as well as age here's the deal functions can't see inside of other functions our birthday function is unaware of our name and age variables one way in which we can make our birthday function aware of these is to pass them as arguments when we invoke the birthday function so based on the last topic on functions i mentioned that when we call a function we type the function's name followed by a set of parentheses i like to imagine the set of parentheses as a pair of telephones and these two functions are talking to each other our main function needs to make our birthday function aware of our name and age variables so what we can do is pass these variables as arguments so between the parentheses we can add our variables separated with a comma so let's pass name and age so anything that you're passing to a function are known as arguments but we need a matching set of parameters within the function declaration so between this set of parentheses we will list our name and age variables but precede each with the data type that we're working with so we have name and age so age is an integer so precede the variable name with int and name is a character array so we're going to precede name with char and then add a set of straight brackets after so these are parameters parameters are what this function needs in order to be executed so this does work happy birthday dear bro you are 21 years old so with parameter setup you can only call this function if you pass a character array as well as an integer if i were to remove these arguments we can no longer call this birthday function error too few arguments to function birthday so when you call a function you can pass some arguments but you need a matching set of parameters and the names of these parameters don't necessarily have to be the same what's important is the order of the arguments and the data type so let's say name is x and age is y so let's replace that here as well and that would work too so yeah those are arguments and parameters arguments are what you're sending a function parameters are what a function expects when it's invoked and the benefits of arguments and parameters is that these functions can talk to each other because functions can't see inside of one another so if you have some variables within a function you can pass them to another function as arguments so yeah those are arguments and parameters if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments section down below and well yeah those are arguments and parameters in c hey what's going on people so the return statement the return statement returns a value back to a calling function here's an example i have a function named square square is going to accept one argument a double it's going to square that double and return the result back to the calling function so here's an example let's say we have double x and i'm going to call the square function and then pass in some value let's say 3.14 so when we call a function we can also return a value back to the spot in which we call a function so within our square function let's set double result equal to x times x effectively squaring it so to return a value back to the calling function we will use this return keyword followed by some value or variable i would like to return result however we need to list the data type of what we're returning within the function declaration right now it's void so if we're returning a double we will list double here if this was an integer we would return int if it was a character we would return char you kind of get the idea so result is a double so we need to change this from void to double and we will return this result back to the calling function so we're effectively stating that double x equals 3.14 squared and then let's print the result so printf the format specifier for a double is lf and we will print x and 3.14 squared is 9.859 now you could shorten this too we could just say return x times x instead of declaring a local variable return x times x and that would work the same so yeah that's basically the return statement you can place it within a function and return a value or variable back to the calling function and the spot in which you invoked that function but if you're going to return a value or variable within the function declaration you need to change void to the data type of what you're returning so yeah that is the return statement and you may have noticed within our main function we're returning zero zero is the exit status if this program runs successfully so instead of void with our main function declaration we have int because zero is technically an integer so yeah that's the return statement if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below well yeah that's the return statement in c hey sup people the trinary operator also known as the conditional operator it's a shortcut to using an if-else statement when assigning or returning a value here's the formula we write a condition followed by a question mark if this condition is true we return some value if true or if that condition is false we return some other value here's an example first we'll use an if-else statement and then later we'll switch to the ternary operator so let's create a function that will find the maximum of two integers and i'm going to assign that to int max and we will invoke a function find max but we'll still need to declare it so let's pass in two integers maybe three and four and then i'm going to display whatever max is okay so let's declare this function so we're returning an integer the name is find max and let's set up some parameters into x and int y so if we're using an if else statement if we need to return x if it's larger we can check to see if x is larger than y if so then return x else return y so this does work so the max between three and four is four so if i switch three to five well then the max is five so a shortcut to writing an if else statement like this if we're returning or assigning a value is that we could instead use the tenary operator so let's return and then we have a condition so this is our condition is x greater than y then we add a question mark then the value we're returning if true so if x is greater than y let's return x colon then our value if this condition is false and here within our else statement we're returning y and we no longer need this if else statement and that's all there is to it so we cut down on all that code and now just have one line of code so it's kind of like a shortcut and this works much the same so the maximum between five and four is five and if i change five back to three well then the max is for so yeah that's the ternary operator it's a shortcut to using an if else statement when assigning or returning a value you write some condition add a question mark like you're asking a question then list some value to return if this condition is true and then some other value if this condition is false so you just follow this formula so yeah that's the trenary operator if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's the canary operator nc hey everybody so let's discuss function prototypes a function prototype is a functional declaration without a body before we declare the main function it ensures that calls to a function are made with the correct number and type of arguments it has some benefits which we'll discuss later basically this is another way in which we can declare and define functions in the last few topics when we were declaring functions we were doing so before the main function so let's say void and we have a function named hello and there will be two arguments and ray of characters named name and int age and what i would like this function to do is print a message using our name and age so hello name you are age years old so what we're going to do is now move this function from before the main function to after the main function and let's declare some name and age variables so char name use your first name and int age make up some age now i'm going to invoke my hello function but pass in an incorrect number of arguments now here's one of the benefits of a function of prototype it's going to ensure that we have the correct number of arguments when we invoke a function so the correct arguments for our hello function are an array of characters and an integer what if i'm missing one of these arguments let's say we only pass in a name and then invoke this function so this is going to result in unexpected behavior and we do have a warning here conflicting types for hello but this program will still compile and execute so here's the result hello bro you are million five hundred twelve thousand three hundred and fifty two years old and if i run this again this will probably be a different number so this will result in unexpected behavior we're not ensuring that calls to a function are made with the correct arguments one way in which we can do that is to add a function prototype before the main function and to add a function prototype to a given function we will declare that function but not give it a body before the main function and then we will later add a body and define what this function is going to do so before the main function we will type the return type of this function void the name of the function hello and then add the data type and the order of arguments so we have a character array and an integer then end it with a semicolon so this is a function prototype it ensures that calls to a function are made with the correct arguments so now if i attempt to call the hello function with only one argument when two are required instead of a warning we'll receive an error and it states that there are too few arguments to function hello so this program will not compile and run successfully which is what we want because we made a mistake and if i were to add the correct arguments now well then this program is going to compile and run fine so here's some important notes regarding function prototypes many c compilers do not check for parameter matching that's why this program was still able to compile and run without a function prototype even though we were missing arguments and that can result in unexpected and unwanted behavior such as saying that i was over a million years old so a function of prototype causes the compiler to flag an error if arguments are missing you can write the functions before the main function that's okay too but a few advantages of using a function prototype is that it's easier to navigate a program when the main function is at the top of your file it also helps with debugging and it's commonly used in header files which is something we need to discuss in a future topic so yeah that's basically a function prototype we're going to define any functions after the main function now and before the main function we will declare a function prototype one function prototype for each function we have besides the main function and this ensures that we have the correct number and type of arguments which will prevent any unexpected behavior it's basically just another way to declare functions that you may run into in the future so yeah those are function prototypes if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are function of prototypes in c hey everybody so now that we know how functions work i thought this would be a good opportunity for us to learn about some useful string functions so there's a lot of string functions that are already written for us just include this header file at the top include string dot h so create two strings one named string one and the other named string two string one will be your first name string two will be your last name and then at the end of this program i am just printing string one using a printf statement so let's begin the first useful string function is string lower so whatever string you pass in as an argument this function will convert a string to lowercase so the first letter in my name is uppercase it's capitalized so after passing in string1 into this function my name is all now lowercase otherwise there's string upper that will convert a string to uppercase and my name is uppercase stringcat will concatenate as in append string2 to the end of string1 so we will append the second argument to the first argument so if i pass in string one then string two this will append my last name to my first name and these strings are now combined or i could append a given amount of characters from string two to string one so the third argument is a number if i append one character from string two to string one then this will take the c from my last name and append it to the end of my first name so that is the string and cat function there's also string copy and this one is actually fairly common so this will copy string two to string one if i print string one well it now displays code instead of bro this will remove the contents from string one and replace them with string two or you could copy a given amount of characters from string two to string one uh let's say that i'm going to copy the first character over so i'm copying the first character from my last name to my first name and my first name is now crow or i could set this to two and this will copy the first two letters over coo all right here's a few more so string set will set all characters of a string to a given character i'm going to set all of the characters from string 1 to a question mark all of the characters within my name are all question marks and string and set will set the first and characters of a string to a given character so i'm going to set the first character of my first name to an x so my name is now x bro and string reverse will reverse a string so if i reverse string one my first name is now orb so this next set of functions will return an integer so i'm going to declare a variable int result and this function is really common string length this returns the string length as an integer if i pass in string one this string has a length of three characters and then i'm going to print my result and this is an integer so the length of my first name is three characters this is a fairly common function the string compare function will compare all of the characters within two strings if they're the same they will return zero if they're different they will return a number beside zero so here's an if statement if result is equal to zero we will print these strings are the same else these strings are not the same so my first name is not equal to my last name these characters are different so this code will print these strings are not the same and let me get rid of that printf statement okay now if i make the strings the same then result is going to be zero these strings are the same and you can compare a given amount of characters too so currently i have these strings set to be the same characters so this will compare only the first character these strings are the same even if i change the other characters the first characters will still be the same so this function will return zero there are two additional versions of string compare and string and compare they are string compare i and string n i compare so these will do the exact same things except they ignore case sensitivity so yeah everybody those are just a few useful string functions there's still a lot more located within this header file but we would need to understand how things like pointers work which we have not discussed yet but i thought i would at least cover some of the basics so yeah those are a few useful string functions in c if you would like a copy of all these notes i'll post them to the comment section down below and well yeah those are a few useful string functions in c hey yeah welcome back so we have to talk about for loops a for loop repeats a section of code a limited amount of times here's an example let's say that we would like to count the numbers 1 through 10. so we can actually write a for loop to do that for us and here's how to create one type four a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces anything within this set of curly braces we can repeat a limited amount of times but before we do so there's a few statements we have to add to our for loop there are three the first is that we need some sort of counter or index and we can actually declare that within the for loop so we will declare an index int index and set the sql to some number let's say one so we will start at one and count to ten and then finish the statement with a semicolon now a common convention is that a lot of people will shorten index to i because it's easier to work with so this is the first statement there's two more and the second statement is a condition how long should we continue repeating this code so let's continue this for loop as long as i our index is less than or equal to 10 and then add a semicolon at the end so that is the second statement and the third statement is that we can increment or decrement our counter so let's take i and increment it by one after each iteration by using i plus plus so let's just test this so printf i'll just print the word test so this should print the word test ten times uh then we should add a new line character at the end that's much better okay now let's replace test with a format specifier we're displaying an integer and let's display i our index and this should count from one to ten yep just like that one through ten so with this third statement we can increment or decrement by one or a greater number so this time let's count by two so we can set this to i plus equals two and we will now count up by two starting from one one three five seven nine or how about three one four seven ten you can also decrement this time let's count from ten to one so let's set i to equal 10 and we will continue this as long as i is greater than or equal to 1 and we will decrement i minus minus so this will count from 10 to 1 and then stop or we could count down by two i minus equals two then we have ten eight six four two or even three or a greater number so yeah that's a for loop it repeats a section of code a limited amount of times there's up to three statements that we can add we can declare an index a counter so to say some condition that we check after each iteration and then some way to increment or decrement our index and then place any code you would like to repeat within a set of curly braces so yeah that's a for loop if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are for loops in c all right we're back at it again so let's talk about while loops a while loop will repeat a section of code possibly unlimited times we will continue some section of code while some condition remains true and it's possible that a while loop might not execute at all depending on what our condition is so here's an example let's create a program that will ask a user for their name if they attempt to skip that prompt then we will keep on asking them for their name indefinitely so here's how we can write a program like that using a while loop we'll need to begin with a character array let's say name and this will be 25 bytes and we will create a prompt using printf what's your name we can use scanf for user input but with names that may contain spaces i'm going to use fgets instead refer to the video on user input to learn more about fgets so i would like to assign my variable name set the size of the user input 25 to match what we have then type stdn for standard input then we just need to get rid of the new line character at the end of our user input so we can write something like this set our character array of name and within the straight brackets we will use the string length function pass in name -1 and we will set this equal to a null character and then at the end we will display the user's name printf let's say hello and then use a format specifier for strings which is s and we will display a user's name okay this is what this looks like currently what's your name i'll type my name hit enter and it says hello bro now what if i don't type in anything like i just hit enter what's your name i'm going to hit enter hello and then there is no name here how can i force a user to type in something well i could use a while loop and that will prompt a user to enter their name indefinitely so here's how to create a while loop type while parentheses curly braces and we need a condition what are we going to check we will continue this while loop while some condition remains true our condition to check to see if we have an empty string we could use the string length function pass in name and check to see if this is equal to zero if it is zero that means that somebody just hit enter without typing in anything so let's print a message to yell at them you did not enter your name and then let's copy this section of code and paste it to reprompt the user to type in their name and that's all there is to it so while this condition remains true we will execute this code forever so let's try it again okay what's your name i'm going to hit enter you did not enter your name what's your name no no no no okay i give up hello whatever your name is so yeah that's basically a while loop it repeats a section of code possibly unlimited times there's a lot of overlap where you could use either a for loop or a while loop and we execute some body of code while some condition remains true however a while loop might not execute at all if this condition is false to begin with so if the user actually does type in something well this condition is false and we do not execute this body of code so yeah that's a while loop it repeats a section of code possibly unlimited times if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are while loops in c hey everybody so let's talk about do while loops a do while loop is a variation of a while loop so a while loop first checks a condition then it executes a block of code if that condition is true so we may not even execute that block of code at all if that condition is false from the get go a do while loop always executes a block of code once and then we checking condition at the end if that condition is true we will continue another loop so here's what i'm thinking for a demonstration we'll create a small program where we will have a user type in as many numbers as they want as long as it's above zero and then we will find a sum so if we're writing a program like that we can first declare two variables int number i'll go ahead and assign these some values right away so we'll set number to zero and int sum equal to zero as well to keep track of the sum we'll first begin by creating a while loop so we will use a while loop and our condition is if number is greater than zero then we will continue to ask the user to type in some numbers if that number is zero or less then we stop so let's ask a user for a number enter a number above zero and then using scanf we will accept some user input and store this within number and let's check to see if number is greater than zero if it is we will take sum set this equal to sum plus number but you can just shorten the statement to plus equals number that's fine too and then at the end we will print whatever the sum is sum we're displaying an integer and we are displaying some so with our number i set this to zero and since our while loop is checking the condition first we're not actually going to execute this body of code so our program skipped this while loop and went straight to the printf statement so a while loop checks a condition first a do while loop will check a condition last so to change this to a do while loop we will take our condition and move it to the end just after the last curly brace and add a semicolon and then before the first curly brace we will add the word do so we will do this once and then check the condition to see if we would like to continue so now if i run this we get that prompt enter a number above zero and i can type in as many numbers as i want so one two three four five so we check the condition at the end so our condition is that if our number is greater than zero we will continue this loop so if i type in negative one we will exit and our sum is 15. so that's the major difference between a while loop and a do while loop a while loop checks a condition first then executes a block of code if that condition is true a do while loop always executes a block of code once then checks a condition if that condition is true then we continue again so yeah that's a do while loop it's a variation of a while loop and if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well that's the do while loop in c hey welcome back so nested loops a nested loop is a loop inside of another loop when you'll encounter them it's really situational so i don't really have one good example but what i'm thinking we'll do is use a nested loop for an exercise what i'm thinking is that we'll let a user type in a number of rows and columns and a symbol and print a rectangle of that given symbol but the user is going to specify a number of rows and columns so let's begin by declaring all of the different variables that we'll need intros and columns and char symbol we'll let the user type in a number of rows and columns enter number of rows then use scanf to accept some user input we are accepting an integer so use d for the format specifier address of operator rows then do the same thing with columns enter number of columns let's create our nested loops you can use either for loops or while loops it's just the concept of one loop inside of another so let's use for loops for our outer loop and inner loop the outer loop is in charge of keeping track of the rows the inner loop will be in charge of keeping track of the columns so i need this outer for loop to iterate once for every row that we have so we could write something like this int i set this equal to one i need to continue this for loop as long as i is less than or equal to rows and then increment i by one after each iteration so now let's create a nested for loop we will declare a loop inside of another loop and this inner for loop is in charge of the columns we should probably not reuse our index of i so let's create a new index and a common naming convention for an inner for loop is to use j because j comes after i in the alphabet so i will set int j equal to one we will continue this as long as j is less than or equal to columns then increment j by one for the time being until we let a user type in a symbol let's just print our index so let's use printf we're displaying an integer and let's display j and let's take a look at this okay enter number of rows how about 3 rows and five columns so here's our output we have the numbers one through five three times so to make this more of a rectangle a grid i'm going to add a new line character whenever we finish a row so printf newline character let's try that again enter number of rows three number of columns five so we have three rows and five columns basically speaking to complete one iteration of our outer loop we have to escape our inner loop first once this condition is no longer true then we will escape the inner loop and complete one iteration of the outer for loop but then once we begin in the next iteration of our for loop we're stuck back within our inner for loop again so that's kind of the concept now this time let's let a user type in a symbol and we will create a sort of rectangle enter a symbol to use then scanf we are accepting a character so use the c format specifier address of operator our symbol variable now we're going to replace j with our symbol and the format specifier for a character is c then let's try this again so how about three rows and six columns okay here's the issue so we have all of this empty space now when we entered our number of columns after hitting enter we have the new line character within our input buffer so our next scana function actually picked that up so what we need to do is clear our buffer and one simple way of doing that there's a couple different ways is that we can just use scanf again and we will read a character and that's one way to do it basically with this line we're just getting rid of the new line character after the last time we use scanf because that's still within our buffer okay let's try this one last time what about four rows and five columns enter a symbol to use uh how about the dollar sign there we go here's our rectangle it has five columns and four rows so yeah that's basically a nested loop it's a loop inside of another loop and when you'll encounter them it's really situational i thought this would be good practice to understand how they work to complete one iteration of the outer loop you have to first escape the inner loop and that may involve completing all iterations of the inner loop so yeah those are nested loops if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are nested loops in c hey people i have a super quick video for you today on the differences between the continue and break statements so when using either statements within the context of a loop a continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop a break statement will exit out of a loop entirely another place where you see break statements is when used within a switch after each case so here's an example let's say that we would like to count the numbers 1 through 20 but i would like to skip the number 13 because 13 is considered an unlucky number so if i were to write a program like that that would look something like this so let's use a for loop and i will set an index of i equal to one continue this as long as i is less than or equal to 20 and then increment i by one then let's print our index so printf we're displaying an integer and let's display i i'm just going to add a new line character after each iteration when we use a printf statement okay so this is what this looks like we have the numbers 1 through 20. so if i would like to skip the number 13 i can use a continue statement but we need to check to see if i is equal to 13 we can use an if statement so if i is equal to 13 then we will continue and let's take a look so we have the numbers 1 through 20 but we are missing 13 so a continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop now if this was a break statement this will break out of our loop entirely so once we reach 13 then we will exit out of this loop entirely so here we only have the numbers 1 through 12 and then we break we exit out of the loop so that's a quick demonstration of the differences between continue and break the continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop a break statement exits out of a loop entirely so yeah that's a super quick video on the differences between the continue and break statements if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah those are the major differences between the continue and break statements in c hey everybody let's talk about arrays an array is a data structure that can store many values of the same data type here's an example let's say i have a variable named price and i have the price of maybe one item in a fictional store of ours so by using an array we can actually store more than one value but it has to be of the same data type so i can turn this variable price into an array and i can do that by following the name of the variable and add a set of straight brackets and then any values i would like to add to this array i will surround with a set of curly braces and there we go we have turned our variable price into an array but i'm going to change the name to prices because i think it would be more descriptive because we can store more than one value now so we can add multiple values each separated with a comma so let's say we have another price that is 10 15 25 and maybe 20. now you may have noticed some parallels when we create a string it's really an array of characters so if i need a name we would say the data type is char and we will create a name array followed by a set of square brackets and i will set this equal to some amount of characters a string is really just an array of individual characters and with my name here i have three individual elements three individual values now if i need to access one of these values i need to use an index number so let's print one of these numbers so printf i'm going to use the format specifier for a double and i'm going to list my array name prices then follow this with a set of straight brackets then i need an index number so each spot within an array is known as an element so we have five elements within our array and to access one of these elements i need to list an index number the first element has an index number of zero because computers always start with zero so if i display prices at index zero this contains the number five i'm actually going to format this let's display it two digits after the decimal and i'll precede this number with a dollar sign much better all right so then if i display prices at index one that is technically our second number of ten dollars so prices at index two is fifteen three is twenty five and four which is our last element is twenty so arrays they have a fixed size we can't change the size after we compile and run our program another thing that you can do too if you do not know what values you would like to initialize your array with you can always just set a size let's say i would like a size of five elements but then i'll assign some values later so later on in our program we can say prices at whatever index let's say index zero i'm going to assign with five and i'll do the same thing for the other elements so prices at index one is maybe ten prices at index two is fifteen three will be twenty five and 4 will be 20. that's another way in which you can initialize an array you can always set a size and then add elements later another option is that you could combine the two we could set a size right away so maybe prices will have a size of 10 and we can right off the bat assign some values right away so we have five elements that are currently filled but then the other five are empty so there's a few different ways in which you can initialize an array so yeah that's basically an array it's a data structure that can store many values of the same data type initializing an array is much like creating a variable except you will add a set of straight brackets after and then you can either add some values right away or later on in your program but you need to list an index number of where you're placing a value within the array and then to access a value within your array you type the array name followed by an index number kind of like a parking spot number so yeah those are arrays in the next video i'm going to show you how we can iterate over the elements in an array using a for loop if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's an introduction to arrays in c hey welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you how we can loop through and print the elements of an array so i have an array of doubles named prices and i just made up some fictional prices to display one of these elements i can use a printf statement i will use the appropriate format specifier for the elements displayed within this array since this array contains doubles i will use the format specifier for a double then to access one of these elements i will type the name of my array followed by a set of straight brackets then an index number so the first element in an array is zero because computers always start with zero then if i need to display the other elements well i would have to manually type prices at index zero then one two three four so on and so forth so this does work if you have a couple elements but what if you have hundreds this method is not going to be practical a better solution is that we could make a for loop and this for loop will iterate once and display each element of this array so let's create a for loop for parentheses curly braces and we'll need an index int i i'll set this equal to zero then we'll need a condition for the time being let's set i less than five but later on we're going to replace five with something else and i'll explain that later and then we will increment i by one so then during each iteration let's use this print statement again and make one change instead of setting an index number let's use our index instead then i'm just going to add a new line character after each printf statement so here we go this for loop should iterate five times and it will display the elements within our array so we have 5 10 15 25 20. maybe i'll add a couple extra things to this format specifier let's display two digits and a dollar sign that's much better so this kind of resembles maybe a receipt of some sort like somebody just bought a bunch of items okay now here's one situation what if we add or remove elements from this array let's say that a user purchases one more item for thirty dollars now the way that this for loop is written it's not going to display this last element because we set this for loop to iterate as long as i is less than or equal to five it's not going to display this last element so we would need some way to update this condition a better solution instead of using a number here is that we could calculate the amount of elements within our array and loop that many times and one way in which we could do that is to use the size of operator so let me demonstrate the size of operator real quick it will return the size of an operand in bytes so let's print this so this will be an integer and we will use the size of operator and pass in our array of prices so this size is going to be in bytes so the size of our ray in bytes is 48 bytes we have six elements made up of doubles each double uses up eight bytes so six times eight is 48 so now let's use the size of operator instead size of prices but we are going to divide the size of our array by the size of one of these elements they're all going to be consistent because they all have the same data type so we will take size of prices divided by the size of one of these elements let's say prices at index zero so 48 divided by eight equals six we will iterate through this for loop six times and here's our array we have 5 10 15 25 20 30 and we can add or remove elements freely and there's no need to update our code because we may not remember to do that later on so yeah that's one way to loop through and print the elements of an array you can use a for loop then use a printf statement and for the index of your array you can use the index of your for loop then if you would like your for loop to calculate how many times it's going to iterate through this array you can use the size of operator pass in prices divided by the size of one of the elements and that will calculate how many elements are within your array so yeah that's one way to loop through the elements of an array if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to loop through and print the elements of an array in c hey everyone two dimensional arrays it's an array where each element is an entire array it's useful if you need a matrix grid or table of data let's begin by creating a simple one-dimensional array of maybe some numbers so the data type is int the array name will be numbers and let's initialize this array with a few numbers 1 two and three something simple so if i would like to store a grid or matrix of data these elements will be the first row and i can add a second row so separate each row with a comma then another set of curly braces and then you can add more values so let's say four five and six and we'll stop here with these separate arrays we will surround with a set of curly braces and preceding the first set of straight brackets we will add a second set of straight brackets so this is now a two dimensional array however with a two dimensional array we have to specify a maximum size of elements within each of these arrays let's say that each of these arrays will have a maximum size of three elements a piece so within the second set of straight brackets i will list three and you can although it's not necessary set a maximum amount of arrays within your two-dimensional array so let's say two because we have two separate arrays within our two-dimensional array now to better visualize how this is more or less a table of data i'm going to rearrange these so this may be a better visualization this first set of straight brackets is for the number of rows and the second set of straight brackets is for the number of columns so we have two rows and three columns within our two-dimensional array now you can declare a two-dimensional array but not assigned values quite yet but you'll need to set a maximum size so right now i'm just going to turn this into one giant comment and let's declare a two-dimensional array with two rows and three columns and here's how to assign some values we will type the name of the array followed by two sets of straight brackets we need a row number and a column number so the first column within the first row is going to be zero zero because computers always start with zero and let's assign this a value of one the second column within the first row would be zero one and let's assign two there then zero two and that will be number three so the first column within the second row would be numbers one zero and this will be four then we will follow the same pattern so where five was that would be one one and six is one two so this is another way to initialize an array you can set a maximum size and then assign some values later or you could assign all of the values right from the beginning if you know what they are okay now how can we display the elements of a two-dimensional array we'll have to use nested loops so let's create a for loop and i will declare an index of i set this equal to zero and for the time being i'm going to say i is less than the number of rows that we have so right now we have two rows but we're going to change this value later to something that's more flexible that will calculate the amount of rows that we have and then i will increment i by one now let's create a nested loop that's in charge of keeping track of the columns and let's use an index of j because we do not want to reuse i so set j equal to zero we will continue this as long as j is less than however many columns we have three a maximum of three and then increment j by one so during each iteration of the inner for loop let's display one of these elements so we will use the format specifier for an integer d is fine followed by our array numbers and then we have two indices so the row is going to be i and this will begin at zero and the columns is j this will also begin at zero so after each iteration of the inner for loop we will increase j when we finish the inner for loop we will increment i by one so by using nested for loops we can iterate over all of the elements of this array so i'm just going to add a space after our number and we should probably add a new line after each row so i'll add a new line let's test this here we go we have our table of two rows and three columns now there's one situation that we may run into what if we change the amount of rows and columns that we have so let's say that we add one more row our 2d array of numbers will have three rows and three columns row two column zero equals seven row two column one will equal eight and row two column two will equal nine so if i were to run this again well this last row is not going to be displayed so it would be better if we can calculate how many rows and columns are within our two-dimensional array and here's one way to do so i'm going to declare two new variables int rows and into columns and i will set the condition of the outer for loop to be as long as i is less than rows and the inner for loop will be j is less than columns now we just need to calculate what these numbers are going to be to calculate rows we can use the size of operator and then pass in the entire size of our two-dimensional rib and we're going to divide this by the size of one of our rows they're all going to have the same size so we can pass in our rain numbers and then specify one of the rows let's say the first row they're all going to be the same okay so that's how we can calculate the number of rows that we have now to find the number of columns we can copy what we have here and then just make a few changes so we will say the size of the first row row 0 divided by the size of one of the elements found within the first row so we can say zero zero and let's print the amount of rows and columns that we have just to test it so we have rows and columns i'm just going to add a new line character real quick okay so we have three rows three columns and here's our table three rows with three columns a piece so yeah that's basically a two-dimensional array it's an array of arrays where each element is an entire array it's useful if you need a matrix grid or table of data and in this example we made a table of integers just the numbers one through nine so there's a couple different ways in which you can initialize a two-dimensional array but you'll need two sets of straight brackets it's optional to set a maximum number of rows but it is necessary to set a maximum number of elements within each row and then to access one of the elements you use two indices one for the row one for the column so yeah those are two dimensional arrays if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are two dimensional arrays in c hey everyone in this video i'm going to show you how we can create an array of strings let's say we will have an array named cars so we will need a two-dimensional array so we need two sets of straight brackets and within the second set of straight brackets we will specify a maximum size for each of these elements let's say maybe 10 characters so a string is already an array of characters let's add our first string maybe we have a mustang so to add a second element we would separate the next one with a comma then we can add another string let's say we have a corvette and then one more how about a maybe camaro okay so with all of these different strings i'm going to surround with a set of curly braces and here we go we have an array of strings it's basically a 2d array of individual characters except each element is a string now one important difference with an array of strings is that we can't directly change one of the values let's say car's at index zero equals a tesla and then i'm going to try and run this so we can't directly assign a new value one way in which we can do so is to use the string copy function so if you're going to use the string copy function include this import string dot h okay so to update one of the values i will use string copy pass in my array and an index number followed by a string so let's say a tesla and this would work now to display an array of strings we can use a for loop and there's no need for a nested loop so we will create an index i set this equal to zero i would like to continue this as long as i is less than and we will calculate how many elements are within our array so we will use the size of operator pass in our array divided by one of the elements size of cars and maybe the first element of zero and then increment i by one during each iteration so then during each iteration let's display one of these elements using a printf statement let's display a string i'll add a new line after each printf statement and let's display our array cards at index of i so this should display tesla corvette and camaro in that order tesla corvette and a camaro so yeah that's an array of strings it's really a two-dimensional array of characters but it involves less steps because each of these strings is already an array and if you need to update or edit one of the values you can use the string copy function so yeah that's how to work with an array of strings if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to work with an array of strings in c all right what's going on people so in this video i'm going to show you how we can swap the values of two variables now you may be wondering why the heck do we need to know this so swapping variables is actually very common within sorting algorithms and when we reach the next topic on sorting arrays we'll need to learn how to do this so let's begin i have two variables x and y x contains the letter x y contains the letter y and let's print these values i'll use a printf statement let's display x and y x equals x y equals y so how can we swap these let's try x equals y and see what happens within both x and y the value is y what about y equals x well then both variables contain the character x so what can we do it seems like we're stuck what we could do is that we could introduce a third variable let's say char and let's name this temp because it's a temporary variable so we have a third variable to work with as temporary storage for some value so let's assign temp is equal to x and then we will assign x equals y and then lastly y equals temp and this should work let's try it yep x equals y and y equals x now this is a little bit different if you're working with strings so let's say these are character arrays and we'll pretend that these are maybe glasses holding some fluid x contains water and y contains maybe lemonade and let's make temp a character array as well but we need to declare a size let's say 15. okay so this isn't gonna work we're already receiving problems expression must be a modifiable l value so when working with arrays it's not enough to simply assign values we could use the string copy function so let's get rid of these and we will use string copy oh also make sure that you include this header file okay so we will copy the contents of x over to temp and it's the same procedure as before string copy y over to x and string copy temp over to y and then make sure you change these format specifiers to strings x did contain water now it contains lemonade y did contain lemonade and now it contains water when swapping variables i like to imagine my variables as glasses and they contain some fluid if we pour the contents of one glass into the other well then the contents will be pushed out and overflow so it would be wise of us to introduce a third glass that's empty to hold one of these fluids so then we can pour the contents of one variable into the other now here's one issue that you may run into when using the string copy function if the length of the second argument is less than the first argument this can lead to unexpected behavior i'm going to replace lemonade with soda and let's see what happens so x doesn't contain anything but y contains water one solution is that we can make these character arrays the same size let's say that they're both 15 and that should solve that issue so that's something you may need to take into consideration when using the string copy function if you're going to swap strings so yeah everybody that's how to swap the values of two variables if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and in the next video i'm gonna show you how we can sort the elements within an array and well yeah that's how to swap the values of two variables in c hey uh what's going on people so in this video we're going to write a small program to sort the elements of an array let's begin with an array of integers and then later we'll create an array of characters the data type will be int and let's name this array and assign some values make sure that they're not in order just make up some numbers that's fine looks good to me now let's calculate the size of our array because we'll need to know how many times we're going to iterate through our array so int size i will set this equal to the size of operator pass in our array this will calculate the size of our array in bytes and to find the number of elements we can divide this by the size of just one element so size of array divided by the size of array at index of zero size will equal the amount of elements within our array and just to keep this code more organized let's declare a function to actually sort all of this for us so we don't have to do that within the main function so let's declare a sort function the return type is void we're not returning anything and let's name this sort and there will be two parameters an array of integers and integer size and let's invoke this function we're invoking sort and then we need to pass in two arguments our array and a size within the sort function we'll need nested loops we can use four loops so the outer for loop will be int i set this equal to zero and we will continue this for loop as long as i is less than the size of our array minus one and then increment i by one and then we need an inner for loop so let's copy our outer for loop paste it and make a few changes so the index for the inner loop will be j and we'll continue this as long as j is less than the size of our array minus one then j plus plus here's what we're doing within our array so we will begin at our first index we're checking to see if the element on the left is greater than the element on the right if so we're going to swap these two values and we'll need the help of a temporary variable much like what we learned in the last topic so let's check to see if the element on the left is greater than the element on the right if it isn't we do nothing so we need an if statement if array at index of j is greater than array at index of j plus one we're adding plus one because we're checking the element directly next to the one that we're currently examining so if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right we will perform a basic variable swap so let's declare a variable in temp to temporarily store some value and i will set the sequel to array at index of j now i need to move the element on the right over to the element on the left array at index of j equals array at index of j plus one and then lastly whatever's within temp i'm moving that to the element on the right so array at index of j plus one equals temp and that's it so if you would like to optimize this you can set size minus i minus one basically this is a bubble sort so depending on the size of this number it's going to find a final resting place since 9 is going to be the largest it's going to be pushed all the way to the right because we will examine 9 against each of these numbers so once 9 is pushed all the way to the right all these other numbers that are less than 9 will be on the left so it's already partially organized and now we just need some way to display the elements of our array so let's declare a print function void and let's name this print array and these will have the same parameters an array of integers and into size and this is a basic for loop so for and i set this equal to zero we will continue this loop as long as i is less than the size of our array and increment i by one and i would like to display each integer and maybe i'll separate these with the space and we are displaying our array at index of i and all we have to do is invoke the print array function and then pass in our array and our size and let's take a look fingers are crossed oh yeah there we go our array is now sorted now if you would like this in descending order all we have to do is switch this if statement around from greater than to less than and our array is sorted in reverse order and we could sort an array of other data types too this time let's sort an array of characters so let's declare an array of characters this time and make up some characters so then to sort an array of characters let's change the data type of our array to characters and then when we display each character make sure that we're using the c format specifier because we were using d before and this should now be sorted yep so that's currently in reverse order so then to switch that around just change the sign all right there you go so yeah everybody that is a simple program to sort the elements of an array this is a basic bubble sort and if you're interested in learning more about sorting algorithms i do have a playlist on data structures and algorithms if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to sort a simple array in c okay everybody so let's talk about structs a struct is short for structure think of it as a collection of related members kind of like variables they can be of different data types unlike with arrays structs are listed under one name in a block of memory in order to refer to that struct we can refer to a variable name and then we have access to that block of memory that contains related members and lastly structs are very similar to classes in other languages if you're familiar with more than just c you'll probably know what a class is but there are no methods within a struct it's only members so we can actually use structs to mimic real world objects let's say that maybe we're playing a game and we need two players each player will have a name and a score these will be the members so to create a struct outside of our main function we will type the keyword struct followed by a tag name let's say we are working with players then we need a set of curly braces then end it with a semicolon so any members think of these like variables so let's say we have a character array named name and i'll give this a size of maybe 12. so we will declare these but not assign them we'll do that later and we have an int named score so each player is going to have a name and a score kind of like we're playing an arcade game now to assign some of these values we're going to create a type of variable and a player is going to be kind of the data type so we will type struct then the tag name which was player and then a variable name let's say we have player 1 and player 2. so with these structs you can reuse them so we have struct player player 1 and struct player player 2. so we can assign values to these members however if we have an array of characters we're going to use the string copy function so let's use the string copy function then to access one of the members you will type the name of that struct so let's say player one and then follow this with a dot the dot is a member axis operator so after typing the dot we have access to a name and score member so let's set the player's name equal to whatever your first name is now if you're not working with an array of characters such as an integer you can just access these directly so let's set player one's score two equal maybe four points and we also have player two but we have not assigned values to its members so this time let's assign player two's name and score so we can just copy what we have but change player 1 to player 2. player 2 let's say is bra and player 2's score is 5. now if i would like to display these members i can do so with a print statement so printf let's display our name first so i will use the s format specifier player one dot name and then i'll add a new line then to access player one's score well that's an integer so i will use the d format specifier player one dot score and then let's do the same thing with player two so player two dot name and player two dot score so we have our player one strucks name member as bro and score member set to four and then our player two struct has a name member of bra and a score member of five so yeah that's basically a struct it's a collection of related members think of these kind of like variables they can be of different data types unlike arrays and they are listed under one name in a block of memory so in this example we have player 1 and player 2. player 1 and player 2 refer to different blocks of memory which contain their own unique members if you're familiar with other programming languages they're very similar to classes but they cannot contain any methods so yeah those are structs if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are structs in c all right typedef typedef is a reserved keyword that gives an existing data type a nickname here's an example let's create a character array of 25 bytes and we'll say that this is user one so character user one and the size is 25 bytes and then make up some username okay so writing some of the syntax can be somewhat tedious what a lot of c programmers will do is that they will use this type def keyword to give some data type a nickname let's use this type def keyword to give a character array of 25 bytes some nickname so i'll do this outside of the main function we will type type def then our data type so this is a character array of 25 bytes and we need some sort of nickname so let's say that a character array of 25 bytes will be known as a user now i don't need all of the syntax now i can type my data type user and then some variable name let's say user one from this point forward if i need a character array of 25 bytes i can call that a user that's my nickname now one place where you see this used a lot is with structs this time let's create a struct at first we won't use the typedef keyword and then i'll show you the benefits later so let's say this is a struct and the tag name is user users will have let's say three members a character array named name of 25 bytes a password of 12 bytes and int id like an id number so to create a struct we would have to type struct then the tag name user and a variable name and let's assign some of these values i'll assign a name password and id looks good to me okay then if i need to create user two i would type again struct user some unique variable name and make up some values okay so with a strut if i would like to use the typedef keyword i will precede the struct keyword with typedef and i don't necessarily need this tag name and after the last curly brace here i will add my nickname i'll call this a user if we need to create a user struct we no longer need to use the struct keyword we can remove this and this should work so let's print some of these members and here are the two users that we created yeah so in conclusion typedef is a reserved keyword that gives an existing data type a nickname and it's mostly used for convenience if we use the typed up keyword when declaring a struct we no longer need to use that struct keyword to create a struct we can just use this nickname as the data type and then come up with some unique variable name so yeah that is the typedef keyword if you found this video helpful please be sure to give this video a thumbs up leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey everybody so in this video i'm going to show you how we can create an array of structs let's say we're working with students and we need to print each student's name and gpa so let's create a struct outside of our main function type struct and then a tag name for the struct let's say student so each student will have a name and a gpa so let's create a character array named name i'll set a maximum size of maybe 12 characters and a gpa that could be a float so float gpa now let's initialize some structs we type struct followed by the tag name and then some variable name to identify each struct so let's say we will have four students overall and i'll go ahead and assign some values right away when we initialize the struct so we need a name and a gpa so the first student let's say is spongebob and spongebob has a gpa of 3.0 so we can copy this and create a few more students so student one student two student three and student four next we have patrick patrick has a 2.5 then sandy sandy is smart so she has a 4.0 and squidward squidward has a 2.0 so we have four students now we will create an array so the data type of our array what it's containing will be struxx it will be struct student it's kind of like the data type so with an array you have to declare what you're going to be putting within the array struct students and then we need an array name so this will be students and then specify a maximum size if you need one but i'm just going to initialize this array with some students so let's add student 1 student 2 student 3 and student 4 and there we go we have an array of structs now if i would like to display each student's name i can use a for loop to loop through our array so for curly braces we will create an index into i set this equal to zero we will loop through this as long as i is less than and then we need to calculate how many elements are within our array so we have four elements but we can do that by using the size of operator passing our array and then divide this by the size of one of these elements size of students and then pick maybe the first element of zero after each iteration we will increment i by one so then within our for loop let's print each student's name so let's use the s format specifier to display a string and we will display our array at index of i whatever our counter is and we will use the member axis operator of dot so follow students at index of i with a dot then we have access to a name and a gpa so let's display each student's name and then i'll add a new line after each printf statement so there we go we have spongebob patrick sandy and squidward now let's display each student's gpa so let's copy this line we are displaying a float so the format specifier for a float is f students at index of i dot gpa then i'll get rid of that new line character and let's take a look to see what we have okay we can see each student's name and gpa but we may want to format this so after each student's name i'll add a tab and i'll allocate maybe 12 characters to display each student's name and then left justify it and then with our gpa let's display two digits after the decimal so i will add dot 2 so this should look better yeah that's much more organized so we have spongebob with the gpa of 3.0 patrick with 2.5 sandy with 4.0 and squidward with a 2.0 so yeah that's how to create an array of structs if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to create an array of structs in c well well well welcome back so enums short for enumerations they are a user-defined type of named integer identifiers a benefit is that they help make a program more readable either for us or for somebody else that's looking over our code so here's how to create some enums you can either declare these within the main function or outside of the main function let's do so outside of the main function so to create some enums type the keyword enum followed by a unique identifier let's say we're working with days of the week so let's say day curly braces and then end this with a semicolon so enums are constants and let's declare some constant names let's say the seven days of the week so separate each constant with a comma and we will just go through the days of the week here are the enumerations that we declared the days sunday through saturday the days of the week now each of these constants has an associated integer so beginning with your first constant this will have a value of zero then the next will have one then two then three then you continue on in that pattern but you can give these a unique value let's change it sunday to one because it's the first day of the week then monday will be two and then we will just continue with these now to use one of these enums we would type enum then our identifier name day it's kind of like a data type and then some variable name let's say today and then you can set the sequel to one of these constant names let's say that today is sunday so an important note with these enumerations they're treated as integers and not strings if i need to work with one of these enums we're going to treat them as if they were an integer so just for an example i'm going to print the value contained within today so this is going to be an integer so we will use the d format specifier and we will display today so since today is equal to sunday this has an associated integer value of one and if i display that this will print the number one if i change this to saturday well then it will print the number seven so an important note is that enums are not strings but they can be treated as integers now how does this make a program more readable so let's write an if-else statement that's going to check what today is first we'll begin with using the associated integer value so if today is equal to 1 or today is equal to 7 then that means it's either sunday or saturday and let's print a message let's say it's the weekend party time else we will print something else i have to work today so today is set to saturday that means that saturday has an associated integer of seven so if today is equal to one or seven well then we will execute this if statement it's the weekend party time i think i'm just going to add a new line real quick now if i set this to a different day of the week let's say monday well then i have to work today so the way that this is written now it's not too readable so instead of using an integer value let's use the associated name with each of these constants so let's replace one with sunday and seven with saturday and i'll change this to maybe sunday so this is a lot more readable especially if somebody else is reviewing your code they may not understand why today is equal to one or today is equal to seven but this makes a lot more sense oh so if today is equal to sunday or if today is equal to saturday then we print it's the weekend party time so that's a huge benefit with enums is that they help make a program more readable so to declare enums you type enum then an identifier and then you can list as many constants as you would like and you can give them an associated integer value too so yeah those are enums if you'd like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah those are enums in c hey uh what's going on everybody so in this video i'm going to show you how we can generate some random numbers in c just as a disclaimer these are pseudorandom numbers they are a set of values or elements that are statistically random so don't use these for any sort of cryptographic security now before we begin include these two header files at the top stdlib and time the first thing that we're going to do is use the current time to generate a seed which we need for random numbers so we can use the s rand function s for seed rand for random and then we will pass in the current time time function pass and zero so we will use the current time as a seed for random numbers and then the function that you need to generate a random number using this seed is the rand function so let's store our number within a variable maybe number one int number one and i will set the sequel to then invoke the rand function now the rand function will give you a random number between 0 and 32 767. so i'm guessing we probably don't need a number that large so depending on the range of numbers that we need we can use modulus and then the maximum number that you would like so if i'm rolling a six sided dice i can say modulus six so the modulus operator gives you the remainder of any division so technically this gives us a random number between zero and five because computers always start with zero but you can add an offset so if i need the numbers one through six i can just add plus one to the end and then maybe i'll surround this section with a set of parentheses just to make this more readable so generate a random number between zero and five add one that gives us a random number between one and six and let's just test that theory so i'm going to use printf and we are displaying an integer and let's display number one so we should have a random number between one and six and our random number is two and if i run this again this will be a different number probably yup six okay now if i need to generate a couple different random numbers i can just use this rand function again so let's say we are rolling three dice number one number two and number three and then i'll print these as well so number one number two and number three and i'll add a new line character after each of these print statements okay so this will give us three random numbers between one and six one three one three five six now it is important that we're generating a random seed let me show you what happens when i take this out so this will give us the same numbers over and over again six six five six six five and six six five so that's why it's important that we use a seed for random numbers now another thing too if you need a larger number you can just change this number for example i play a lot of dungeons and dragons so i may need to roll a 20-sided dice so i can just set this to 20. so 288 and let's try this again 12-5-4 so yeah that's how to generate some random numbers in c if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to generate some random numbers in c hey y'all what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a number guessing game in c so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey everybody so now that we know how to generate some pseudo-random numbers in c i thought this would be a good opportunity for us to create a number guessing game if we're working with pseudorandom numbers be sure to include at least these three header files at the top of your program so let's generate two constants min and max const int and a naming convention for constants is to make all of the letters uppercase so minimum will be the minimum number that we will generate when we generate a random number so let's pick a number between maybe one and one hundred so min will be one and max will be 100 but feel free to take the liberty to choose some other numbers and we'll need int guess to store a user's guess int guesses to keep track of the guesses and int answer okay now if we're working with random numbers we'll want to create a seed and to do that we can actually use the current time so use the s rand function and pass in time pass in zero so this uses the current time as a seed to generate some random numbers and if we need a random number between these two constants min and max this is what we can do so we will assign answer set this equal to call the rand function and use the modulus operator and set this to max and then we will add min as an offset so this will generate a random number between these two constants 1 and 100 or some other numbers if you have something different so this line of code will generate a random number between min and max now before we actually move on let's test this just to be sure that everything's working so let's print whatever the answer is so we're displaying an integer we are displaying answer and let's see what this is so my answer this round is 73 if i run this again it is 93. now if i change these values we will adjust the range in which some random numbers will generate so if i set min to 100 and max to 1000 that should change the range of numbers and this time i have 334 but i'll change this back to 1 and 100 okay so we know that we're generating a random number so let's move on let's create a do while loop so it's going to take at least one guess in order for somebody to guess the correct answer so do curly braces we'll add while and check a condition at the end and the condition is guess does not equal answer so let's create a prompt and ask the user to enter a guess enter a guess and we will use scanf to accept some user input so this is an integer and we are storing this within guess so address of operator guess now that we have our user's guess let's compare it to our answer so we'll use an if statement and check to see if guess is greater than answer so that means a user guessed a number that was a little too high so let's print a message to let the user know to hi and then we can use an else if statement else if guess is less than answer well then their guess was too low print too low so if our guess is not greater than the answer or less than the answer that means they must have got it right so within an else block let's print correct so then after our if else statements let's increase guesses by one guesses plus plus the very best possible score a user can get is one if they guess it on the first try so before we finish a while loop we will increment guesses by one so then once we escape our while loop let's print the user's final score so we will print the answer this is an integer and we are displaying answer and we will display the guesses it took so guesses and display the value found within guesses and this part isn't necessary but i like to add some text decorations so maybe i'll add a bunch of asterisks to make it look nice let's run it enter a guess i'll guess something right in the middle between so maybe 50. so that guess was too low so maybe 75 okay that was too high so our numbers between 50 and 75 how about 62 that's too low so it's between 62 and 75 how about 69 that's still too low so between 69 and 75 maybe 72 that's still too low so it's between 72 and 75 73 all right that was the right answer i'm just gonna fix one thing real quick uh let's add a new line here okay let's try this again okay until i guess i'll try 50 again that's too high maybe 25 that's still too high what about 12 2 low maybe 18 2 low 21 that's still too low 23 too low 24 and 24 was the correct answer all right everybody so i thought that would be a fun guessing game we could create for practice if you would like a copy of all this i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that is a simple number guessing game in c all right people so now that we know how to create an array of strings i thought this would be a good opportunity for us to create a quiz game so before we begin make sure to include these two header files at the top of your program so let's begin with a 2d array of characters and these will store our questions and i'm going to set a maximum size for each question to 100 bytes and we can go ahead and initialize this array with some questions so remember with strings each string is its own array so let's ask maybe three questions but feel free to pick any amount that you like and come up with any questions you would like as well or you can copy me i don't care what year did the c language debut then separate each string with a comma then just to make this more readable i'm going to go down to the next line so this is question two now who is credited with creating c and one more question what is the predecessor of c so now we have some questions we'll need some options this could be a separate 2d character array char options and i'll copy the dimensions from questions and we'll create four sets of options for each question this is the first set of options for the first question and then let's add a second set of options for the second question and a third set now we'll create an answer key this will be a one-dimensional array so char answers and the size will be three and i will set this equal to my answer key so the correct answers for my quiz are b a b so these will be individual characters all separated with a comma b a b so let's calculate the number of questions that we have so i will declare int number of questions and set this equal to sizeof operator pass in our two-dimensional array of questions and divide this by one of the elements because they all have the same size questions at index zero and let's declare char guess to store our guess and int score to keep track of the player's score so now let's begin this i will print the title quiz game then add a new line okay now we need to loop through all of the questions so let's use a for loop so we will have an index of i set to zero and i would like to loop through this as long as i is less than the number of questions that we have then increment i by one and to test this let's print our questions so printf we're displaying a string so use the s format specifier questions add index of i and then i'll add a new line character after each printf statement okay let's at least test this so we should cycle through our questions okay here are my questions what year did the c language debut who is credited with creating c what is the predecessor of c and this part isn't necessary but i'm going to add some text decorations i'll just display a bunch of asterisks i'll do that before and after the question and let's try that again oh then add a new line character that's a little bit better after our question let's display the possible options so we will need a nested for loop so four now this part's gonna be a little bit tricky we need to begin our for loop at every fourth string within our for loop let's set int j equal to i times four so during the first iteration i will be zero so zero times four is zero but during the next iteration of the outer for loop i is going to equal one so one times four is four so that way we will begin the inner for loop with every fourth string within our 2d array of options and the condition is going to be j is less than i times 4 and then we would like to display four strings this for loop will cycle four times beginning at every fourth string and then we need to increment j by one now let's print every option so this is a string i'll add a new line and we are printing options at index of j and let's test this just to be sure that it works okay so we have our question followed by four possible options now let's accept some user input after the nested for loop currently our program isn't going to wait around for any user input that's why i displayed all the questions and options okay we will create a prompt to have a user type in a guess guess and we will use scanf to accept some user input we are accepting a single character and use the address of operator guess now let me show you what happens when we run this real quick so i'm just going to type in anything let's say a okay so we skipped question two that's because after using scanf when we accept a character we have that new line character within the input buffer so we need to clear that so one way in which we can clear that is to use scanf again use the c format specifier and that's it so this will clear the new line character from input buffer so this should no longer just skip question two okay let's say a b c okay so we know we can accept some user input now now here's one thing what if somebody types in a lowercase character i think that should still count even though we're looking for an uppercase character so let's take our guess and use the two upper function to make it uppercase guess equals to upper then pass in guess so basically we're passing in our guess making it uppercase and reassigning it to our guess and let's write an if else statement to check our guess if it's equal to our answer so if else our condition within our if statement if guess is equal to answer at index of i remember that we're still within the for loop the outer for loop so we have that index oh that's answers plural if a user's guess is equal to the answer then let's print correct and then give them one point so printf correct and then increment our score score plus plus else we will print wrong and you can give the correct answer if you would like just do that within here now once we cycle through all of the questions we can display a user score so be sure to do that outside of the for loop the outer for loop that is so let's use printf and display final score so i'm going to display two values so the first will be the player score divided by the number of questions so we have two integers to work with and we are displaying score and number of questions and then if you want you can add some text decoration to make it look cool so i'm going to run through this quiz once and intentionally get one question wrong so what year did the c language debut that would be 1972 that's b who is credited with creating c uh let's say doc brown so d and what is the predecessor of c that would be b okay and my final score is two out of three so let's try that again and this time i will try and get one hundred percent so the correct answer is b a dennis ritchie and b and my final score is three out of three so yeah i thought that would be a simple quiz game in c if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's a simple quiz game in c hey everybody let's talk about bitwise operators these are special operators used in a bit level programming knowing binary is important for this topic so if you don't know how binary works i would recommend skipping to the next topic but if you're comfortable with binary well this video is for you so let's begin i'm going to discuss five different bitwise operators and or exclusive or left shift and right shift let's create three variables x y and z x will equal six y will equal twelve and z will store our result and we will set that to be zero so i'm going to give you the binary representation of each of these numbers so six is this number so we have eight bits that's a byte and this is the binary representation of the number six 12 would be this binary number and zero zero is easy that would be all zeros so let's use the and bitwise operator so what we're going to do is set z equal to x and y so imagine this imagine that we're aligning all of these bits in columns using the and bitwise operator we're going to look at our operands x and y if both of these are a one we will assign one to our result and let's begin with the first column on the right both of these are zeros so our result will stay at zero and with the next column we have one and zero and using the and bitwise operator both of these need to be 1 in order to assign one to our result so we will skip this column now with our third column these are both 1 so we will assign 1 to our result the next column is zero and one we skip it and the rest are just zero so this binary number is the binary representation of the number four so let's test that z equals x and y and let's print z and equals we're displaying an integer i'll add a new line and we are displaying z and let's see if this is for yep our result z is equal to four now let's move on to or so let's set this back to zero and we will set z equal to x or y or is represented by a single vertical bar and we will print or let's try and guess what z is going to be before we actually display it with the or bitwise operator only one of these bits needs to be one in order for us to assign one to the result so since these are both zero this will stay at zero this bit is one this one's zero so this would be one and for the next column of bits these are both one so that counts as well and we have a one in here so that is one and the rest are just zero so this is the binary representation of the number fourteen and let's see if z is equal to fourteen yep we got that right so let's set this back to zero now with exclusive ore that is represented by a carrot with exclusive ore only one of these bits can be won if neither or both of these bits are one we don't assign anything so both of these bits are zero they will stay a zero we have one of these bits as one and not the other so that counts as one now with this next column both of these are one and using exclusive ore only one of these can be one so since these are both ones we do not assign anything so we keep that as zero and with the next column only one of these is one so we will set this to be one within the result and this is the binary representation of ten and let's test that z equals x exclusive or y and we will print exclusive or equals z and let's see if that's ten yep z is equal to ten now here's left shift we will shift these bits so many spaces to the left using left shift so we will set z equal to x and then left shift which is represented by two left angle brackets a number of spaces let's begin with one so we have x equal to six what we're doing is shifting these bits one spot to the left and then adding zero at the end and this is the binary representation of the number 12. actually it's the same as y currently these binary numbers are the same and let's print that so shift left and z should equal 12 yep and if i shift left twice well then we are just moving these bits one more space and now this is 24. there you go so you probably noticed that there's a pattern every time we shift a binary number to the left it effectively doubles now let's right shift so let's copy this paste it and we will use two right angle brackets and this is shift right and let's set this to 6. if we're right shifting we shift these bits one spot to the right and this is the binary representation of the number three and if i print this after shifting right once our result z is three every time we shift right we're effectively cutting our number in half now if i shift right again we will shift these bits one more spot to the right and we are going to truncate this one at the end and this will give us one that is the binary representation of the number one so technically half of three is 1.5 but we can't store that 0.5 portion so it just gets truncated all right everybody those are just a few bitwise operators they are special operators used in bit level programming there's five that we discussed today but there is another known as the complement operator but that's a little bit more complex and i might save that for another video so yeah those are bitwise operators if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah those are some bitwise operators in c all right everybody so let's talk about memory memory is an array of bytes within ram and a memory block is a single unit in bytes within memory they're used to hold some value and a memory address is the address of where a memory block is located within ram i like to think of memory as a street with a bunch of different houses and each house is a memory block which can hold some value kind of like they're storing a person and a memory address is the house address on that street where that memory block is located so this would be a street address like one two three fake street so when we declare variable let's say we have char a when we declare a variable we are setting some amount of memory blocks aside to store some value so the memory block that this variable is using up has some memory address and if i assign this variable a value let's say maybe x well then if i was to go into my computer's memory and look for this address i would find this character so imagine we're walking down the street and we are looking for somebody's address so we're going house to house and we find a matching address if i were to open their front door i should probably knock first at least then i will find the character x so that's kind of an analogy i like to use when thinking about memory so let's declare a couple other characters we have char b i'll give this a value of y and char c and i'll give this a character of z okay so let's find the size of each of these characters so i'm going to use a printf statement i'm going to display an integer and the size of each of these characters is within bytes so i'm going to use the size of operator and pass in one of my characters so i'm going to pass in a and i'll do the same thing with b and c so the size of each of these characters is one bite and i think i'm just going to add a new line here much better okay now we can actually access the address of each of these variables so each of these variables is using one block of memory a single block of memory is a byte so within a printf statement i would like to display an address so the format specifier is p and i will use the address of operator then the name of one of my variables so i'll display the address of variables a b and c and then display each on a new line so here are the memory addresses for these three variables these addresses are in hexadecimal these are the street addresses of each of our memory blocks on our fictional street hey uh so this is bro from the future just a quick crash course on hexadecimal values with standard decimal values they use the numbers 0 through 9 but with hexadecimal you use the numbers 0 through 9 as well as a through f so that gives you a total of 16 different values for each digit so that's why there's a mix of numbers and letters so each of these variables uses one memory block they use one byte of memory so beginning with variable a this has this street address but if we go down to the next memory block you can see that there is just one change f goes down to e and then with variable c this address goes down by one so f e d these are contiguous memory blocks they're all next to each other but now if we switch to a different data type like a short we haven't used these in a long time well shorts use two bytes of memory as we can see here so these hexadecimal addresses are now going down by two e d c b a so each of these variables are using two memory blocks we need an even larger house even more memory blocks and they use up two memory addresses and then if i change these two integers well they're going to use up even more memory so integers use four bytes memory and these are the street addresses of these three variables and doubles use double the size of an integer doubles use eight bytes of memory and these street addresses are decrementing by eight if this was a fictional street with houses well doubles use up eight bytes memory so think of these like mansions they're using up a lot of space now what happens with an array i'm going to declare char a and declare an array this will be an array of characters to begin with so let's say character array b and i'll give this a size of one so i'm going to print the size of a and the size of b as well as their memory addresses our single character a uses one byte and this is the street address of this variable and our array b also uses up one byte and this is the street address of where this array begins if i set the size of this array to 2 well then my array is going to use 2 bytes and now it has a different address to accommodate the increased size of the array and if i change this to 3 it now uses 3 bytes of memory and it has a new address and if i change the data type of the array we'll have to take that into consideration so a short uses two bytes memory and we need three elements so that's a total of six two times three is six and if i change this to int and int uses four bytes so four times three is twelve and a double is eight so eight times three is twenty four so yeah that's kind of the basics of memory so memory is an array of bites within ram think of it like a street and a street contains houses each house is a memory block that can hold some value think of each value as a person living in that house and in order to find a person we have to know their address like a street address c refers to these variables by their street address but that's difficult for us to understand so we just refer to this memory address as a variable name because that's easier for humans to work with so yeah that's some basics of memory and c and in the next video we're going to discuss pointers so if you would like a copy of my notes here i'll post them to the comment section down below and well yeah that's the basics of memory in c hey yeah it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the basics of pointers in c so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm oh yeah we finally made it to pointers we're only about 40 topics in a pointer is a variable like reference that holds a memory address as a value to another variable array etc some tasks are performed more easily with pointers and here's a comprehensive list of a few of the benefits in this video we're going to more or less focus on building a solid foundation with pointers and understanding how they work so let's say we have a variable int edge and i'll give this some value a variable has a value and an address and let's display the value and the address of this variable using two print statements so first i'm going to display the address of this variable address of age then i will use the p format specifier to display an address in hexadecimal and we are displaying the address of age and ampersand is the address of operator address of age and i would also like to display the value of age value of age and this is an integer and we will display age so variables have a value and an address this is the address of this variable and the value at this address as you know there's tons of different things we can do with a value of a variable but there are things that we can do with an address as well so we can actually store this address within a separate variable a variable like reference and that is called a pointer so to create a pointer we will make sure these are of the same data type as the variable we're pointing to age is an integer so we will declare this pointer of the integer data type and the next step to declare a pointer is that we will use an asterisk this is the in direction operator and a common naming convention for pointers is that you type lowercase p the name of the variable you're going to point to but make the first letter uppercase and i'm going to set this equal to the address of age so the address of age and the value at this variable are the same and let's test that theory so this time i'm going to display the address of age and the value of ph and this will display an address so change the format specifier from d to p and i'm going to turn this line into a comment for now okay so these addresses should both be the same the address of age as well as the value stored within ph so our pointer has its own address but the value stored within it is an address and we can access the value at this address by using the indirection operator so this time i'm going to print the value of age and the value at stored address and to dereference a pointer you will type the pointer name ph appreciated with the indirection operator as my own personal nickname for the indirection operator i call it the value at address operator that's not any official name that's just how i think about it so we're extracting a value at the given address within this pointer so if i display the value of age and the value at the stored address using the indirection operator well both of these are going to be the same so we have 21 stored within our edge and after dereferencing this pointer we're extracting the value at this given address so you use the indirection operator when you declare a pointer as well as when you want to access a value at the stored address so with the data types of the pointer you'll want to make sure they're consistent c is a strongly typed language so if i change the data type of my pointer to char using my compiler i'll receive a warning initialization of char from incompatible pointer type int now the actual data type of a pointer is the same they use eight bytes to store an address so i'm going to print the size of our variable as well as our pointer so i'll change this data type back to what it was originally and this time i'm going to print the size of our age variable as well as the size of our pointer size of age and we're displaying an integer and this will be in bytes size of age size of pointer age and then i'm going to display a new line okay so the size of our age variable is 4 bytes it's an integer integers use 4 bytes so even though we declared our pointer as an integer the actual size of our pointer is going to be 8 bytes that's enough to store a hexadecimal address so just as good practice since c is a strongly typed language you'll want to be sure that the data type of your pointer is consistent with the variable that it's pointing to now here's one thing that we can do with pointers we can pass a pointer as an argument to a function so outside of my main function i'm going to declare a function void let's say print age first we'll do this with passing and integer so int age and i will display the value of age you are age years old and i will display my age variable then at the end we will pass in our variable print edge and i will pass in age for now i'm just going to turn all of these into comments okay so you know this works you are 21 years old you could also pass in a pointer too so i'm going to this time pass in pointer age and we need to change the parameter from an integer to a pointer so precede the parameter name with the indirection operator and i'll rename this parameter as ph in order to access the value of the address stored within my pointer i need to de-reference so i will use the indirection operator then type my pointer name ph and this will do the same thing as before so yeah those are pointers oh and before i forget you can declare and initialize a pointer in two steps but it would be good practice if you're declaring a pointer to assign a value of null since we already declared this pointer we do not need to use this indirection operator again when assigning a value so p h equals the address of age so it's considered good practice to assign null if you're declaring a pointer and not yet assigning a value so yeah that's basically a pointer it's a variable like reference that has a memory address as value to another variable array etc some tasks are performed more easily with pointers and to declare a pointer you use the indirection operator and if you need to access a value stored within a pointer you type the pointer name preceded with the indirection operator so yeah that is a quick intro to pointers if you found this video helpful please give this video a thumbs up leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right let's do this here's how we can write to a file in c let's create a file pointer the data type is file and i'll name this pf it's a pointer to a file and i will set this equal to then invoke the f open function we will pass in a name we would like to give our file let's name this test.txt but if you would like this to be a different file extension such as html well you can change it to that then uh we'll keep this as a plain text file just to keep it simple and to write to a file there is a second argument a mode so this could be w for right a for append r for read but we are looking for w for now so it is good practice at the end of your program to close any files that are open so we will use the f close function and pass in our pointer p f make sure to not dereference it now to write a line of text to our file we can use f print f pass in our pointer p f do not dereference it and then some string of text let's say spongebob squarepants so this file will be created in the same folder as my c program so after running this we have a new text file within the same folder and it says spongebob squarepants what if i run this again and write something different like patrick starr so if the mode is w then we will actually overwrite any existing data already within this file if we need to append a file we can use the a mode for append so this time let's append some text to the end of our document spongebob squarepants and you have to keep track of any new lines that you add too so if i run this again and this time i am appending some text well patrick starr is still there and we appended spongebob squarepants to the end of our file now if you would like to delete a file here's how i'm going to turn all of this into one giant comment let's use a little bit of file detection let's check to see if our file does exist within our if statement let's invoke the remove method and we will pass in the name or location to our file test.txt if we remove this file successfully it will return zero so if after invoking the remove function if this returns zero that's its exit code that means that file was deleted successfully let's print a message to let the user know that file was deleted successfully else we will print a different message printf that file was not deleted okay let's try this so here's my file within the same folder if i run this that file was deleted successfully and that file is no longer within the same folder you can see here that this says deleted and if i run this again we will not be able to locate that file because it's not there now you can write a file to a different location let's say i would like to write a file to my desktop i can set a relative file path or an absolute file path i'll use an absolute file path i'm going to get the file location of my desktop so i'm just going to click on one of these folders go to properties and copy this location so with my file name i'm going to precede this with an absolute file path then any backslashes might need to be double backslashes so this time if i write a file then this file will appear at this location on my desktop and here's that file test.txt and it says spongebob squarepants well alright everybody that is how to write append and delete files in c if you found this video helpful be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro alright people so in this video i'm going to show you how we can read the contents of a file someplace on your computer you can either place this within the same folder as your c program or someplace else i think it would be cool if we read a file from our desktops so i'm going to create a new file and this is going to be a plain text file and i'll write a poem i'll name this poem.txt here's my beautiful poem are red violets are blue booty booty booty booty rockin everywhere okay i'm going to save and then i'll need the file location of where this is located i'm going to right click go to properties and copy this file path and save it for later now to read a file on your computer we'll need to create a pointer the data type is file and i'll name this p f and i will set the sql to then invoke the f open function pass in your file mine is poem.txt so if this file is not within the same folder as your c program you'll need a relative or absolute file path since this file is on my desktop i could use an absolute file path so preceding my file name i will paste that location and then each backslash may need to be a double backslash because that is an escape sequence for a backslash character okay the second argument is the mode this time we are going to read a file so pass in r for the second argument then it's good practice at the end of your program to close any open files we will invoke the f close function pass in our pointer do not dereference it and we will need one more thing a buffer a buffer is going to act as a container an array of characters to hold one line of our text document one line at a time so let's declare an array of characters named buffer and i'll set the size to 255. our buffer is going to hold one line of our file one line at a time and to read a single line from our file we will use the f gets function and there are three arguments our buffer this is what we're inserting a line of text into a maximum input size i'll set this to be 255 to match our buffer and then a pointer to the file that we're opening and again make sure to not dereference it so this will read a single line of text and then let's print our buffer so we're printing a string and we are displaying whatever is currently within our buffer so after running this this will read a single line of text whatever's at the top roses are red now if i need to read all of the contents of my file i can place this section of code within a while loop so with our condition i'm going to move the f gets function within the condition if we reach the end of a file f gets will return null so let's continue this while loop while f gets does not return no if we do not return null then we will print whatever's within our buffer now if i run this this will display all of the lines from my file roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty booty rocking everywhere and if you would like you can add a little bit of file detection so before we reach our while loop let's check to see if that file even exists before we attempt to open and read it so let's check to see if our pointer equals no if it is null that means we could not locate this file so i'm going to print unable to open file and we'll create an else statement else let's read and print the contents of this file okay so let's say i get the file extension wrong let's say i'm looking for an html file named poem and i try and read this unable to open file but if we are able to locate this file we will open it and read the contents and then close this file so yeah everybody that is how to read the contents of a file line by line if you found this video helpful please be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro oh yeah what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a game of tic-tac-toe so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right let's begin so the first thing that you're going to need is to include these files at the top of your c program and we will create seven different function prototypes so the return type of this first function is void and the name of this function will be reset board our board is going to be a 2d character array and our second function is void print board which will print our 2d character array then with this next function this has a return type event and this will check free spaces if after invoking this function this function returns zero that means the game is over there's no more places to move and we will need void player move when it's the player's turn to move void computer move when it's the computer's turn to move char check winner so we have a few different win conditions to check and void print winner and there is one parameter a single character soap char so these are function prototypes we tend to declare these before the main function because they help with readability after the main function we will give each of these a body so copy and paste those functions and then give each a body and with the parameter for print winner the parameter is char winner now let's head back to the top of our program and there's a few global variables that we're going to declare we could declare these as local variables within the main function but this program is going to get really complicated then if we have to pass around pointers to a two-dimensional array so just to keep this simple i'm going to create some global variables there are some downsides to global variables so i tend to not to like to use these so we have a 2d array of characters named board it's our game board and let's create two constants constant char player a naming convention for constants is to make all of the letters uppercase and i will set this to a character of my choice i could be oh or i could be x or something else maybe i could be a dollar sign whatever uh i'll set myself to be an x and then let's create a constant for the computer constant char computer and computers will be o so within the main function we will declare a local variable char winner and i'll go ahead and set this to an empty space so if our winner is in empty space that means there currently is no winner if player wins then that would be an x if computer wins that's a no within our main function this is acting as a driver for our code so the first thing we'll do is reset our board so we are going to initialize all of the different characters within our two-dimensional board so let's head to this function so with our reset board function we need nested loops the outer for loop is for the rows the inner for loop will be for the columns int i set this equal to zero and i need to iterate this for loop three times one for each row that we have and then we need an inner for loop so change the index to j and for each index within our 2d array at index of i and j i will set the sequel to an empty space so when we call the reset board function each element within this 2d array of characters will be an empty space effectively clearing it so back within the main function after resetting our board let's print our board and fill in this function so you can get creative with this here's one thing that i'll use so i'm going to print a space a character a space a vertical bar space character space vertical bar space character these three format specifiers are placeholders the first character i'm going to display is our board at index of zero zero that is row zero column zero followed by board index zero one then board zero two and with the next printf statement let's display something like this a new line three dashes a vertical bar three dashes another vertical bar three dashes then a new line okay so let's copy these paste it once and we need to change these indices so with this third printf statement these indices will be one zero one one one two and then do this again so copy paste two zero two one two two then at the end i'll add a new line printf new line oh let me fix one thing okay so this is what it should be all right now back within our main function we're going to create a while loop and we'll surround our print board function within this while loop so our condition is if winner is equal to an empty space that means there currently is no winner and after invoking the check free spaces function the value returned does not equal zero so let's fill in this check free spaces function within the check free spaces function let's declare a local variable int free spaces and i'll initially set this to nine then we need a nested for loops and i equals 0 we will continue this as long as i is less than 3 i plus plus then create an inner for loop change the index from i to j and within the inner forward loop we're going to write an if statement and we are checking to see if our 2d array of characters bored at index of i and j does not equal an empty space if whatever spot we're on is currently occupied we will take our free spaces local variable and decrement it by one then outside of our for loops we will return free spaces if we return zero that means the game is over there's no more places a player can move so heading back to our main function it will be let's say the player's turn to move first so invoke the player move function and we'll need to fill this in with the player move function we will declare two local variables intex into y and we will ask a user to enter in a row number and a column number of where they would like to move to so using a printf statement we will enter row number one through three and then use the scan f function to accept some user input so this will be an integer and use the address of operator x so a user is going to enter in numbers one through three for which row that they need but with arrays they always begin with zero but a user is not going to know that so with whatever the user types in we will decrement x by one so this gives us rows zero through two technically then do the same thing with our columns enter column number one through three address of operator y then decrement y we will check to see if the coordinates that the user gave are occupied or not so using an if statement we will check to see if our board at index of x and y does not equal an empty space that means that this spot is currently occupied by another character so let's print something to let a user know invalid move else that spot is open so take our board at index of x and y set this equal to our player character so we're going to take all of this code and place it within a do while loop so write do while place your code that you just wrote within there and our condition is if our board at index of x and y does not equal an empty space if the spot that the player would like to place their character is currently occupied then we will ask them again to enter some coordinates uh then within our else statement we need to break out of this while loop okay so that is everything for the player move function so then heading back to the main function after the player moves we will check to see if there's a winner winner equals then invoke the check winner function and we will fill in this function next so find the check winner function and we need to check all of the different win conditions so first we will check each row using a for loop so this section of code we will check our rows we'll need a for loop to iterate three times one for each row int i equals zero continue this as long as i is less than three increment i by one so this if statement is going to get a little bit funky we need to check each set of horizontal elements so let's begin with board at index of i and zero so that would be the top left element and we are checking to see if the character here is equal to this character so board at index i and one and we're checking to see if board at index of i and zero is equal to board at index of i and two so here we're checking to see if this element is equal to this element and this element is equal to this element if they're all consistent we have a winner so we will return whatever character is within one of these elements let's say this one so return board at index of i index of zero return whatever character is within here this section of code will check all of the win conditions for each row but now we need columns so check columns and we can copy most of this so copy it and paste it then we just need to change these indices around so if board at index 0 i is equal to board at index of one i and board at index of zero i is equal to board at index of two i then we will return whatever character is within board index of zero index of one so this section of code will check for any column when conditions then next we have diagonals there's only two check diagonals so let's copy this section of code paste it so our indices are 0 0 is equal to 1 1. 1 1 is in the middle and board at index of zero zero is equal to board at index of two two if so then return zero zero then we have one more diagonal so copy this paste it and here are the elements if board at 0 2 is equal to board at 1 1 so 0 2 is the bottom left 1 1 is the middle and board at zero zero equals board at two zero that is the top right corner right here so if we have a diagonal we have a winner so return board at zero 2 let's say if after checking all of these different win conditions there is no winner then let's return an empty character that means there currently is no winner so then head back to the main function after invoking the check winner function let's write an if statement to see if the game is over so our condition is if winner does not equal an empty space that means there is a winner or after invoking the check free spaces function and the value returned is zero then we will break out of this while loop this is everything done for the player now we need to create a section of code within our while loop for the computer so copy this section of code and paste it and this time it will be the computer's move invoke the computer move function and we will need to fill in the computer move function within the computer move function the computer's move will be randomly generated and to generate some random numbers we'll need a seed so to create a seed to generate random numbers invoke the s rand function pass in time invoke it pass in zero and we will declare intex and into y we will generate two random numbers between zero and two now before we generate some random numbers let's check to see if we even have any free spaces available so our if statement is going to be check free spaces invoke it then if this is greater than zero then we will generate some random numbers and we'll do so within a do while loop so within this do while loop we will generate two random numbers between 0 and 2. x equals invoke the rand function modulus three then y equals invoke the rand function modulus three with our condition let's check to see if the spot generated is even open so board at index of x and y does not equal an empty space so we will keep on generating random numbers until there is an open space then escape this while loop so if we find an open space let's take our board at index of x and y set the sequel to our computer player this is all within an if statement else if there are no more spaces available we will invoke the print winner function and pass in an empty space this means that there is no winner it's a draw now let's fill in this print winner function this function is fairly easy if winner is equal to player then we will print you win else if winner is equal to computer then we will print you lose else if there is no winner then it's a tie it's a draw it's a tie within the main function we just have a few more things to add so outside of our while loop we will print our board and print the winner print board and print winner there is one argument whoever the winner is so let's run this once enter row numbers one through three uh let's say one and one so i moved here and the computer moved to row three column two uh let's say row three column three okay so i moved here and the computer is up here so i moved to row three column three and our computer is at row one column three uh then i'll move to the middle two two and it looks like i won this round so let's try this again and we will intentionally lose so one one two one one two two two and unfortunately it looks like i lost this time let's attempt to tie and it looks like it's a tie so it looks like this game is working so what if we would like to ask the user if they would like to play again we can easily place our code within a do while loop so within our main function let's create char response and we will create a do while loop so take all of this code after the do while loop beginning with reset board copy it delete it and then paste it within the do while loop at the top of our do while loop let's reset winner and response winner equals an empty space and response equals an empty space then heading to the bottom of our do while loop let's ask if the user would like to play again so after displaying the winner let's create a prompt printf would you like to play again y for yes and for no and i'm just going to clear our buffer by using scanf and accepting a character just in case there is a new line character within our buffer then we will use the scanf function and accept a character after clearing our buffer and we will use the address of operator response now just in case somebody types in lowercase y i would still like to count that as yes so i'm going to take our response set this equal to invoke the to upper function pass in response and with this condition we will continue playing while our response is equal to the character y and at the end let's print thanks for playing okay let's run this one last time all right i win would you like to play again i'll type in y for yes and we have a new game all right it looks like i win so this time i will exit by typing n thanks for playing so yeah everybody that is a game of tic-tac-toe if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below hey if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that

N1twTeNMdOE,C break vs continue 🥊,2021-10-06T21:06:13Z,hey people i have a super quick video for you today on the differences between the continue and break statements so when using either statements within the context of a loop a continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop a break statement will exit out of a loop entirely another place where you see break statements is when used within a switch after each case so here's an example let's say that we would like to count the numbers 1 through 20 but i would like to skip the number 13 because 13 is considered an unlucky number so if i were to write a program like that that would look something like this so let's use a for loop and i will set an index of i equal to one continue this as long as i is less than or equal to 20 and then increment i by one then let's print our index so prince f we're displaying an integer and let's display i i'm just going to add a new line character after each iteration when we use a printf statement okay so this is what this looks like we have the numbers 1 through 20. so if i would like to skip the number 13 i can use a continue statement but we need to check to see if i is equal to 13 we can use an if statement so if i is equal to 13 then we will continue and let's take a look so we have the numbers 1 through 20 but we are missing 13 so a continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop now if this was a break statement this will break out of our loop entirely so once we reach 13 then we will exit out of this loop entirely so here we only have the numbers 1 through 12 and then we break we exit out of the loop so that's a quick demonstration of the differences between continue and break the continue statement will skip the rest of a section of code and force the next iteration of a loop a break statement exits out of a loop entirely so yeah that's a super quick video on the differences between the continue and break statements if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah those are the major differences between the continue and break statements in c
Vh4krbTnTAA,C 2D arrays ⬜,2021-10-06T21:06:25Z,hey everyone two-dimensional arrays it's an array where each element is an entire array it's useful if you need a matrix grid or table of data let's begin by creating a simple one-dimensional array of maybe some numbers so the data type is int the array name will be numbers and let's initialize this array with a few numbers one two and three something simple so if i would like to store a grid or matrix of data these elements will be the first row and i can add a second row so separate each row with a comma then another set of curly braces and then you can add more values so let's say four five and six and we'll stop here with these separate arrays we will surround with a set of curly braces and preceding the first set of straight brackets we will add a second set of straight brackets so this is now a two dimensional array however with a two-dimensional array we have to specify a maximum size of elements within each of these arrays let's say that each of these arrays will have a maximum size of three elements a piece so within the second set of straight brackets i will list three and you can although it's not necessary set a maximum amount of arrays within your two-dimensional array so let's say two because we have two separate arrays within our two-dimensional array now to better visualize how this is more or less a table of data i'm going to rearrange these so this may be a better visualization this first set of straight brackets is for the number of rows and the second set of straight brackets is for the number of columns so we have two rows and three columns within our two-dimensional array now you can declare a two-dimensional array but not assigned values quite yet but you'll need to set a maximum size so right now i'm just going to turn this into one giant comment and let's declare a two dimensional array with two rows and three columns and here's how to assign some values we will type the name of the array followed by two sets of straight brackets we need a row number and a column number so the first column within the first row is going to be zero zero because computers always start with zero and let's assign this a value of one the second column within the first row would be zero one and let's assign two there then zero two and that will be number three so the first column within the second row would be numbers one zero and this will be four then we will follow the same pattern so where five was that would be one one and six is one two so this is another way to initialize an array you can set a maximum size and then assign some values later or you could assign all of the values right from the beginning if you know what they are okay now how can we display the elements of a two-dimensional array we'll have to use nested loops so let's create a for loop and i will declare an index of i set the sql to zero and for the time being i'm going to say i is less than the number of rows that we have so right now we have two rows but we're going to change this value later to something that's more flexible that will calculate the amount of rows that we have and then i will increment i by one now let's create a nested loop that's in charge of keeping track of the columns and let's use an index of j because we do not want to reuse i so set j equal to zero we will continue this as long as j is less than however many columns we have three a maximum of three and then increment j by one so during each iteration of the inner for loop let's display one of these elements so we will use the format specifier for an integer d is fine followed by our array numbers and then we have two indices so the row is going to be i and this will begin at zero and the columns is j this will also begin at zero so after each iteration of the inner for loop we will increase j when we finish the inner for loop we will increment i by one so by using nested for loops we can iterate over all of the elements of this array so i'm just going to add a space after our number and we should probably add a new line after each row so i'll add a new line let's test this here we go we have our table of two rows and three columns now there's one situation that we may run into what if we change the amount of rows and columns that we have so let's say that we add one more row our 2d array of numbers will have three rows and three columns row two column zero equals seven row two column one will equal eight and row two column two will equal nine so if i were to run this again well this last row is not going to be displayed so it would be better if we can calculate how many rows and columns are within our two-dimensional array and here's one way to do so i'm going to declare two new variables int rows and into columns and i will set the condition of the outer for loop to be as long as i is less than rows and the inner for loop will be j is less than columns now we just need to calculate what these numbers are going to be to calculate rows we can use the size of operator and then pass in the entire size of our two-dimensional array and we're going to divide this by the size of one of our rows they're all going to have the same size so we can pass in our rain numbers and then specify one of the rows let's say the first row they're all going to be the same okay so that's how we can calculate the number of rows that we have now to find the number of columns we can copy what we have here and then just make a few changes so we will say the size of the first row row 0 divided by the size of one of the elements found within the first row so we can say zero zero and let's print the amount of rows and columns that we have just to test it so we have rows and columns i'm just going to add a new line character real quick okay so we have three rows three columns and here's our table three rows with three columns a piece so yeah that's basically a two-dimensional array it's an array of arrays where each element is an entire array it's useful if you need a matrix grid or table of data and in this example we made a table of integers just the numbers one through nine so there's a couple different ways in which you can initialize a two-dimensional array but you'll need two sets of straight brackets it's optional to set a maximum number of rows but it is necessary to set a maximum number of elements within each row and then to access one of the elements you use two indices one for the row one for the column so yeah those are two dimensional arrays if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are two-dimensional arrays in c
Hzg3kCHJcxI,C reading files 🔎,2021-10-06T21:04:27Z,all right people so in this video i'm going to show you how we can read the contents of a file someplace on your computer you can either place this within the same folder as your c program or someplace else i think it would be cool if we read a file from our desktops so i'm going to create a new file and this is going to be a plain text file and i'll write a poem i'll name this poem.txt here's my beautiful poem roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty booty rockin everywhere okay i'm going to save and then i'll need the file location of where this is located i'm going to right click go to properties and copy this file path and save it for later now to read a file on your computer we'll need to create a pointer the data type is file and i'll name this p f and i will set the sequel to then invoke the f open function pass in your file mine is poem.txt so if this file is not within the same folder as your c program you'll need a relative or absolute file path since this file is on my desktop i could use an absolute file path so preceding my file name i will paste that location and then each backslash may need to be a double backslash because that is an escape sequence for a backslash character okay the second argument is the mode this time we are going to read a file so pass in r for the second argument then it's good practice at the end of your program to close any open files we will invoke the f close function pass in our pointer do not dereference it and we will need one more thing a buffer a buffer is going to act as a container an array of characters to hold one line of our text document one line at a time so let's declare an array of characters named buffer and i'll set the size to 255 our buffer is going to hold one line of our file one line at a time and to read a single line from our file we will use the f gets function and there are three arguments our buffer this is what we're inserting a line of text into a maximum input size i'll set this to be 255 to match our buffer and then a pointer to the file that we're opening and again make sure to not dereference it so this will read a single line of text and then let's print our buffer so we're printing a string and we are displaying whatever is currently within our buffer so after running this this will read a single line of text whatever's at the top roses are red now if i need to read all of the contents of my file i can place this section of code within a while loop so with our condition i'm going to move the f gets function within the condition if we reach the end of a file f gets will return null so let's continue this while loop while f gets does not return no if we do not return null then we will print whatever's within our buffer now if i run this this will display all of the lines from my file roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty booty rocking everywhere and if you would like you can add a little bit of file detection so before we reach our while loop let's check to see if that file even exists before we attempt to open and read it so let's check to see if our pointer equals no if it is null that means we could not locate this file so i'm going to print unable to open file and we'll create an else statement else let's read and print the contents of this file okay so let's say i get the file extension wrong let's say i'm looking for an html file named poem and i try and read this unable to open file but if we are able to locate this file we will open it and read the contents and then close this file so yeah everybody that is how to read the contents of a file line by line if you found this video helpful please be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
DplxIq0mc_Y,C pointers explained👉,2021-10-06T21:02:42Z,hey yeah it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the basics of pointers in c so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm oh yeah we've finally made it to pointers we're only about 40 topics in a pointer is a variable like reference that holds a memory address as a value to another variable array etc some tasks are performed more easily with pointers and here's a comprehensive list of a few of the benefits in this video we're going to more or less focus on building a solid foundation with pointers and understanding how they work so let's say we have a variable int age and i'll give this some value a variable has a value and an address and let's display the value and the address of this variable using two print statements so first i'm going to display the address of this variable address of age then i will use the p format specifier to display an address in hexadecimal and we are displaying the address of age and ampersand is the address of operator address of age and i would also like to display the value of age value of age and this is an integer and we will display age so variables have a value and an address this is the address of this variable and the value at this address as you know there's tons of different things we can do with a value of a variable but there are things that we can do with an address as well so we can actually store this address within a separate variable a variable like reference and that is called a pointer so to create a pointer we will make sure these are of the same data type as the variable we're pointing to age is an integer so we will declare this pointer of the integer data type and the next step to declare a pointer is that we will use an asterisk this is the in direction operator and a common naming convention for pointers is that you type lowercase p the name of the variable you're going to point to but make the first letter uppercase and i'm going to set this equal to the address of age so the address of age and the value at this variable are the same and let's test that theory so this time i'm going to display the address of age and the value of ph and this will display an address so change the format specifier from d to p and i'm going to turn this line into a comment for now okay so these addresses should both be the same the address of age as well as the value stored within ph so our pointer has its own address but the value stored within it is an address and we can access the value at this address by using the indirection operator so this time i'm going to print the value of age and the value at stored address and to dereference a pointer you will type the pointer name ph appreciated with the indirection operator as my own personal nickname for the indirection operator i call it the value at address operator that's not any official name that's just how i think about it so we're extracting a value at the given address within this pointer so if i display the value of age and the value at the stored address using the indirection operator well both of these are going to be the same so we have 21 stored within our edge and after dereferencing this pointer we're extracting the value at this given address so you use the indirection operator when you declare a pointer as well as when you want to access a value at the stored address so with the data types of the pointer you'll want to make sure they're consistent c is a strongly typed language so if i change the data type of my pointer to char using my compiler i'll receive a warning initialization of char from incompatible pointer type int now the actual data type of a pointer is the same they use eight bytes to store an address so i'm going to print the size of our variable as well as our pointer so i'll change this data type back to what it was originally and this time i'm going to print the size of our age variable as well as the size of our pointer size of age and we're displaying an integer and this will be in bytes size of age size of pointer age and then i'm gonna display a new line okay so the size of our age variable is four bytes it's an integer integers use four bytes so even though we declared our pointer as an integer the actual size of our pointer is going to be eight bytes that's enough to store a hexadecimal address so just as good practice since c is a strongly typed language you'll want to be sure that the data type of your pointer is consistent with the variable that it's pointing to now here's one thing that we can do with pointers we can pass a pointer as an argument to a function so outside of my main function i'm going to declare a function void let's say print age first we'll do this with passing and integer so int age and i will display the value of age you are age years old and i will display my age variable then at the end we will pass in our variable print edge and i will pass in age for now i'm just going to turn all of these into comments okay so you know this works you are 21 years old you could also pass in a pointer too so i'm going to this time pass in pointer age and we need to change the parameter from an integer to a pointer so precede the parameter name with the indirection operator and i'll rename this parameter as ph in order to access the value of the address stored within my pointer i need to de-reference so i will use the indirection operator then type my pointer name ph and this will do the same thing as before so yeah those are pointers oh and before i forget you can declare and initialize a pointer in two steps but it would be good practice if you're declaring a pointer to assign a value of null since we already declared this pointer we do not need to use this indirection operator again when assigning a value so p age equals the address of age so it's considered good practice to assign null if you're declaring a pointer and not yet assigning a value so yeah that's basically a pointer it's a variable like reference that has a memory address as value to another variable array etc some tasks are performed more easily with pointers and to declare a pointer you use the indirection operator and if you need to access a value stored within a pointer you type the pointer name preceded with the indirection operator so yeah that is a quick intro to pointers if you found this video helpful please give this video a thumbs up leave a

yD3MGmGtlWY,C quiz game 💯,2021-10-06T21:00:05Z,all right people so now that we know how to create an array of strings I thought this would be a good opportunity for us to create a quiz game so before we begin make sure to include these two header files at the top of your program so let's begin with a 2d array of characters and these will store our questions and I'm going to set a maximum size for each question to 100 bytes and we can go ahead and initialize this array with some questions so remember remember with strings each string is its own array so let's ask maybe three questions but feel free to pick any amount that you like and come up with any questions you would like as well or you can copy me I don't care what year did the C language debut then separate each string with a comma then just to make this more readable I'm going to go down to the next line so this is question two now who is credit did with creating C and one more question what is the predecessor of C so now we have some questions we'll need some options this could be a separate 2D character array Char options and I'll copy the dimensions from questions and we'll create four sets of options for each question this is the first set of options for the first question and then let's add a second set of options for the second question and a third set now we'll create an answer key this will be a one-dimensional array so Char answers and the size will be three and I will set this equal to my answer key so the correct answers for my quiz are b a b so these will be individual characters all separated with a comma b a b so let's calculate the number of questions that we have so I will declare int number of questions and set this equal to size of operator pass in our two-dimensional array of questions and divide this by one of the elements because they all have the same size questions at index0 and let's declare Char guest to store our guest and int score to keep track of the player score so now let's begin this on I will print the title quiz game then add a new line okay now we need to Loop through all of the questions so let's use a for Loop so we will have an index of I set to zero and I would like to Loop through this as long as I is less than the number of questions that we have then increment I by One and to test this let's print our questions so print F we're displaying a string so use the S format specifier questions add index of I and then I'll add a new line character after each print F statement okay let's at least test this so we should cycle through our questions okay here are my questions what year did the C language debut Who is credited with creating C what is the predecessor of c and this isn't necessary but I'm going to add some text decorations I'll just display a bunch of asterisks I'll do that before and after the question and let's try that again oh then add a new line character that's a little bit better after our question let's display the possible options so we will need a nested for Loop so four now this part's going to be a little bit tricky we need to begin our for loop at every fourth string within our for Loop let's set int J equal 2 I * 4 so during the first iteration I will be 0er so 0 * 4 is zero but during the next iteration of the outer for loop I is going to equal 1 so 1 * 4 is four so that way we will begin the inner four loop with every four fourth string within our 2D array of options and the condition is going to be J is less than I * 4 and then we would like to display four strings this for Loop will cycle four times beginning at every fourth string and then we need to increment J by one now let's print every option so this is a string I'll add a new line and we are printing options at index of J and let's test this just to be sure that it works okay so we have our question followed by four possible options now let's accept some user input after the nested for Loop currently our program isn't going to wait around for any user input that's why it displayed all the questions and options okay we will create a prompt to have a user type in a guess guess and we will use scan F to accept some user input we are accepting a single character and use the address of operator guess now let me show you what happens when we run this real quick so I'm just going to type in anything let's say a okay so we skipped question two that's because after using scan F when we accept a character we have that new line character within the input buffer so we need to clear that so one way in which we can clear that is to use scan if again use the C format specifier and that's it so this will clear the new line character from input buffer so this should no longer just skip question two okay let's say a b c okay so we know we can accept some user input now now here's one thing what if somebody types in a lowercase character I think that should still count even though we're looking for an uppercase character so let's take our guess and use the two upper function to make it uppercase guess equals two upper then pass in guess so basically we're passing in our guess making it uppercase and reassigning it to our guess and let's write an if else statement to check our guess if it's equal to our answer so if else our condition within our if statement if guess is equal to answer at index of I remember that we're still within the the for Loop the outer for Loop so we have that index oh that's ansers plural if a user's guess is equal to the answer then let's print correct and then give them one point so print F correct and then increment our score score Plus+ else we will print wrong and you can give the correct answer if you would like just do that within here now once we cycle through all of the questions we can display a user score so be sure to do that outside of the for Loop the outer for Loop that is so let's use print F and display final score so I'm going to display two values so the first will be the player score divided by the number of questions so we have two integers to work with and we are displaying score and number of questions and then if you want you can add some text decoration to make it look cool so I'm going to run through this quiz once and intentionally get one question wrong so what year did the C language debut that would be 1972 that's B Who is credited with creating C uh let's say Doc Brown so D and what is the predecessor of C that would be B okay and my final score is two out of three so let's try that again and this time I will try and get 100% so the correct answer is b a Dennis Richie and B and my final score is three out of three so yeah I thought that would be a simple quiz game in C if you would like a copy of this code I'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's a simple Quiz Game Inc
Lk-b45vrT8U,C array of structs 🏫,2021-10-06T20:57:10Z,hey everybody so in this video i'm going to show you how we can create an array of structs let's say we're working with students and we need to print each student's name and gpa so let's create a struct outside of our main function type struct and then a tag name for the struct let's say student so each student will have a name and a gpa so let's create a character array named name i'll set a maximum size of maybe 12 characters and a gpa that could be a float so float gpa now let's initialize some structs we type struct followed by the tag name and then some variable name to identify each struct so let's say we will have four students overall and i'll go ahead and assign some values right away when we initialize this struct so we need a name and a gpa so the first student let's say is spongebob and spongebob has a gpa of 3.0 so we can copy this and create a few more students so student one student two student three and student four next we have patrick patrick has a 2.5 then sandy sandy is smart so she has a 4.0 and squidward squidward has a 2.0 so we have four students now we will create an array so the data type of our array what it's containing will be structs it will be struct student it's kind of like the data type so with an array you have to declare what you're going to be putting within the array struct students and then we need an array name so this will be students and then specify a maximum size if you need one but i'm just going to initialize this array with some students so let's add student one student two student three and a student four and there we go we have an array of structs now if i would like to display each student's name i can use a for loop to loop through our array so for curly braces we will create an index into i set this equal to zero we will loop through this as long as i is less than and then we need to calculate how many elements are within our array so we have four elements but we can do that by using the size of operator pass in our array and then divide this by the size of one of these elements size of students and then pick maybe the first element of zero after each iteration we will increment i by one so then within our for loop let's print each student's name so let's use the s format specifier to display a string and we will display our array at index of i whatever our counter is and we will use the member axis operator of dot so follow students at index of i with a dot then we have access to a name and a gpa so let's display each student's name and then i'll add a new line after each printf statement so there we go we have spongebob patrick sandy and squidward now let's display each student's gpa so let's copy this line we are displaying a float so the format specifier for afloat is f students at index of i dot gpa then i'll get rid of that new line character and let's take a look to see what we have okay we can see each student's name and gpa but we may want to format this so after each student's name i'll add a tab and i'll allocate maybe 12 characters to display each student's name and then left justify it and then with our gpa let's display two digits after the decimal so i will add dot two so this should look better yeah that's much more organized so we have spongebob with the gpa of 3.0 patrick with 2.5 sandy with 4.0 and squidward with a 2.0 so yeah that's how to create an array of structs if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to create an array of structs in c
qLVrwCvVPGo,C sort an array 💱,2021-10-06T20:54:26Z,hey uh what's going on people so in this video we're going to write a small program to sort the elements of an array let's begin with an array of integers and then later we'll create an array of characters the data type will be int and let's name this array and assign some values make sure that they're not in order just make up some numbers that's fine looks good to me now let's calculate the size of our array because we'll need to know how many times we're going to iterate through our array so int size i will set this equal to the size of operator pass in our array this will calculate the size of our array in bytes and to find the number of elements we can divide this by the size of just one element so size of array divided by the size of array at index of zero size will equal the amount of elements within our array and just to keep this code more organized let's declare a function to actually sort all of this for us so we don't have to do that within the main function so let's declare a sort function the return type is void we're not returning anything and let's name this sort and there will be two parameters an array of integers and integer size and let's invoke this function we're invoking sort and then we need to pass in two arguments are array and a size within the sort function we'll need nested loops we can use four loops so the outer for loop will be int i set this equal to zero and we will continue this for loop as long as i is less than the size of our array minus one and then increment i by one and then we need an inner for loop so let's copy our outer for loop paste it and make a few changes so the index for the inner loop will be j and we'll continue this as long as j is less than the size of our array minus one then j plus plus here's what we're doing within our array so we will begin at our first index we're checking to see if the element on the left is greater than the element on the right if so we're going to swap these two values and we'll need the help of a temporary variable much like what we learned in the last topic so let's check to see if the element on the left is greater than the element on the right if it isn't we do nothing so we need an if statement if array at index of j is greater than at index of j plus one we're adding plus one because we're checking the element directly next to the one that we're currently examining so if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right we will perform a basic variable swap so let's declare a variable in temp to temporarily store some value and i will set the sql to array at index of j now i need to move the element on the right over to the element on the left array at index of j equals array at index of j plus one and then lastly whatever's within temp i'm moving that to the element on the right so array at index of j plus one equals temp and that's it so if you would like to optimize this you can set size minus i minus one basically this is a bubble sort so depending on the size of this number it's going to find a final resting place since 9 is going to be the largest it's going to be pushed all the way to the right because we will examine 9 against each of these numbers so once 9 is pushed all the way to the right all these other numbers that are less than 9 will be on the left so it's already partially organized and now we just need some way to display the elements of our array so let's declare a print function void and let's name this print array and these will have the same parameters an array of integers and into size and this is a basic for loop so for and i set this equal to zero we will continue this loop as long as i is less than the size of our array and increment i by one and i would like to display each integer and maybe i'll separate these with a space and we are displaying our array at index of i and all we have to do is invoke the print array function and then pass in our array and our size and let's take a look fingers are crossed oh yeah there we go our array is now sorted now if you would like this in descending order all we have to do is switch this if statement around from greater than to less than and our array is sorted in reverse order and we could sort an array of other data types too this time let's sort an array of characters so let's declare an array of characters this time and make up some characters so then to sort an array of characters let's change the data type of our array to characters and then when we display each character make sure that we're using the c format specifier because we were using d before and this should now be sorted yep so that's currently in reverse order so then to switch that around just change the sign all right there you go so yeah everybody that is a simple program to sort the elements of an array this is a basic bubble sort and if you're interested in learning more about sorting algorithms i do have a playlist on data structures and algorithms if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to sort a simple array in c
shLeCvDQYp4,C print an array with loop 🔃,2021-10-06T20:51:51Z,hey welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you how we can loop through and print the elements of an array so i have an array of doubles named prices and i just made up some fictional prices to display one of these elements i can use a printf statement i will use the appropriate format specifier for the elements displayed within this array since this array contains doubles i will use the format specifier for a double then to access one of these elements i will type the name of my array followed by a set of straight brackets then an index number so the first element in an array is zero because computers always start with zero then if i need to display the other elements well i would have to manually type prices at index zero then one two three four so on and so forth so this does work if you have a couple elements but what if you have hundreds this method is not going to be practical a better solution is that we could make a for loop and this for loop will iterate once and display each element of this array so let's create a for loop four parenthesis curly braces and we'll need an index int i i'll set this equal to zero then we'll need a condition for the time being let's set i less than five but later on we're going to replace five with something else and i'll explain that later and then we will increment i by one so then during each iteration let's use this print statement again and make one change instead of setting an index number let's use our index instead then i'm just going to add a new line character after each printf statement so here we go this for loop should iterate five times and it will display the elements within our array so we have 5 10 15 25 20. maybe i'll add a couple extra things to this format specifier let's display two digits and a dollar sign that's much better so this kind of resembles maybe a receipt of some sort like somebody just bought a bunch of items okay now here's one situation what if we add or remove elements from this array let's say that a user purchases one more item for thirty dollars now the way that this for loop is written it's not going to display this last element because we set this for loop to iterate as long as i is less than or equal to five it's not going to display this last element so we would need some way to update this condition a better solution instead of using a number here is that we could calculate the amount of elements within our array and loop that many times and one way in which we could do that is to use the size of operator so let me demonstrate the size of operator real quick it will return the size of an operand in bytes so let's print this so this will be an integer and we will use the size of operator and pass in our array of prices so this size is going to be in bytes so the size of our array in bytes is 48 bytes we have six elements made up of doubles each double uses up eight bytes so six times eight is 48. so now let's use the size of operator instead size of prices but we're going to divide the size of our array by the size of one of these elements they're all going to be consistent because they all have the same data type so we will take size of prices divided by the size of one of these elements let's say prices at index zero so 48 divided by eight equals six we will iterate through this for loop six times and here's our array we have 5 10 15 25 20 30 and we can add or remove elements freely and there's no need to update our code because we may not remember to do that later on so yeah that's one way to loop through and print the elements of an array you can use a for loop then use a printf statement and for the index of your array you can use the index of your for loop then if you would like your for loop to calculate how many times it's going to iterate through this array you can use the size of operator passing prices divided by the size of one of the elements and that will calculate how many elements are within your array so yeah that's one way to loop through the elements of an array if you would like a copy of this code i'll post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to loop through and print the elements of an array in c
b4DPj0XAfSg,C for loops in 3 minutes! 🔁,2021-10-06T20:48:11Z,hey yeah welcome back so we have to talk about for loops a for loop repeats a section of code a limited amount of times here's an example let's say that we would like to count the numbers 1 through 10. so we can actually write a for loop to do that for us and here's how to create one type 4 a set of parentheses then a set of curly braces anything within this set of curly braces we can repeat a limited amount of times but before we do so there's a few statements we have to add to our for loop there are three the first is that we need some sort of counter or index and we can actually declare that within the for loop so we will declare an index int index and set this equal to some number let's say one so we will start at one and count to ten and then finish the statement with a semicolon now a common convention is that a lot of people will shorten index to i because it's easier to work with so this is the first statement there's two more and the second statement is a condition how long should we continue repeating this code so let's continue this for loop as long as i our index is less than or equal to 10 and then add a semicolon at the end so that is the second statement and the third statement is that we can increment or decrement our counter so let's take i and increment it by one after each iteration by using i plus plus so let's just test this so printf i'll just print the word test so this should print the word test 10 times then we should add a new line character at the end that's much better okay now let's replace test with a format specifier we're displaying an integer and let's display i our index and this should count from one to ten yep just like that one through ten so with this third statement we can increment or decrement by one or a greater number so this time let's count by two so we can set this to i plus equals two and we will now count up by two starting from one one three five seven nine or how about three one four seven ten you can also decrement this time let's count from 10 to 1 so let's set i to equal 10 and we will continue this as long as i is greater than or equal to 1 and we will decrement i minus minus so this will count from ten to one and then stop or we could count down by two i minus equals two then we have ten eight six four two or even three or a greater number so yeah that's a for loop it repeats a section of code a limited amount of times there's up to three statements that we can add we can declare an index a counter so to say some condition that we check after each iteration and then some way to increment or decrement our index and then place any code you would like to repeat within a set of curly braces so yeah that's a for loop if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah those are for loops in c
wRNinF7YQqQ,Learn CSS in 1 hour 🎨,2021-09-08T14:00:20Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys everything you need to know to get started using css so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm okay let's do this css css is an acronym for cascading style sheets it's defined as a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as html i stole that definition from wikipedia i like to think of building a website very similar to building a house we need three things structure style and functionality we can use html for structure this would be like the skeleton the frame of our house with css we can add styles such as colors decorations lighting and with javascript we can add functionality in our house analogy this would be similar to plumbing heating electricity but in this video we're going to focus on style now to work with css you'll need a text editor i just so happen to be using vs code so let's jump over to that here we are within vs code or some other text editor that you prefer so you'll need an html document to work with if you don't have one just go to new file and then you can create one just make sure the extension ends with html there are three ways in which we can apply css properties to html elements inline internal or external external works the best especially if you have a large website we'll need some sample text to work with so let's create a title for this webpage using a pair of h1 header tags this is my website and let's create maybe four paragraphs as well so these are in pairs of p tags and we'll need some sample text if you need some sample text type lorem and then tab to generate some sample text so let's copy that line and paste it three additional times okay there we go so we can apply css inline so whatever element you would like to apply css properties to within the opening tag you would set the style attribute equal to some css properties within quotes let's say that i would like to change the background color of my webpage so within the opening body element i will set the style attribute equal to one or many css properties let's change the background color so type background color colon and then end it with a semicolon and then we will list either a color name like black you can use rgb values and these come in groups of three so black would be three zeros so depending on what values you have here this will change the color or there's hexadecimal values hexadecimal values are preceded with a hashtag and there are six digits that follow so black is 60 rows where white is six f's but you can always look up a color picker and then just copy the values after you find a color that you like it's a lot easier perhaps we would like a black background so i'll just keep this simple and use color names instead but you can use rgb values and hexadecimal values okay now i would like to make my h1 header tag white so i will set the style attribute equal to the color property this time color is for the font color background color is for well the background color so color white now with our paragraph tags let's apply more than one css property so let's set the style equal to and list whatever properties you would like to apply within double quotes and then separate each with a semicolon uh let's begin with the background color let's make this maybe gray and let's change the color to what about white then i'm just going to copy the style attribute and paste it for each of these paragraphs this is somewhat redundant but there's an easier way of doing this with internal style sheets to apply an internal style sheet within the head of your html document you'll need a pair of style tags whatever element you would like to apply css properties to you will list that element for example the body then follow that with a pair of curly braces then you will type the name of a css property like background color and set it to some value like black and then we no longer need this style attribute there we go you may need to save and refresh this time let's apply css to the h1 header tag via an internal style sheet uh so let's copy this value and get rid of it okay this time we would like to change our h1 header tags so list that here within our style element h1 curly braces list any css properties within the curly braces color white and we'll do the same thing with our paragraph tags so let's get rid of these so type p curly braces and then we will paste the css properties so you can apply more than one css property just place them within the curly braces so there we go and you can see that this is a lot less redundant instead of making all of the changes in line you can place them within an internal style sheet now the last method which i think is the best method is an external style sheet so we will create a new css file so i'm going to right click go to new file let's name this style.css i'm going to copy everything within my style element and then get rid of our style elements tags and within the style sheet we will paste everything that we just copied now we just need to link our html file with our css file and to do that within the head tag we will type link rel equals rel is an attribute that names a relationship of the linked document to the current document so rel will be stylesheet then set the href attribute equal to the relative file path of your css file they're right next to each other i only need to list the file name there we go we have applied css properties via an external style sheet and this is the preferred way of doing things so you can reuse this one style sheet for many different html pages so let's say that we create a new html document like page2.html by the way if you need to generate the body of your html document if you're using vs code you can type exclamation point and then tab let's create a really quick html document for page two this is page two and then i'll create two paragraphs let's say okay i'm going to open page 2 with live server and take a look page 2 does not have any css filing but we can reuse the same css file all we have to do is link our html file with our css file within the header element i am just going to make that link so this is really convenient if you have to make any changes to your website let's say that you need to make all of the pages on your website instead of the background color black let's say maybe gray well you can just make that change here and that one change will apply to all of your html documents so you only need to make that change in one place that's why external style sheets are really useful one unique feature of css is that we can target any specific element by id or a class that they may be in any element that has these names will have these styles but what if i would like maybe one of these paragraphs to have a different font color i can give one of these paragraphs a unique id so within the opening tag i will set the id attribute equal to a unique identifier let's say p1 because it's well the first paragraph so then to target that specific id i will type hashtag that id and let's set the color equal to what about tomato now for practice let's give each of these a unique id let's say p1 p2 p3 and p4 if we need to change p2's color to tomato well then we target p2 what about p3 just change the id to p3 and then p4 so you can target a specific element by id you just have to be sure to fill out that id attribute or you can target anything within the same class a class is like a group in this example let's say that all odd numbered paragraphs should be read all even-numbered paragraphs should be blue so i'm going to instead give these each a class you can keep the ids if you want to so type class equals the first paragraph will be odd class odd the second paragraph will be class even then odd and even so to target elements by a class you type dot the name of the class so anything within the odd class let's say we'll have a color of red and i'm going to get rid of this tomato color our first paragraph is within the odd class the same applies with our third paragraph and then i would like to make any elements within the even class blue color blue so our second paragraph is blue and our fourth paragraph is blue so yeah everybody that is a quick introduction to css it means cascading stylesheets we can apply css properties in one of three ways inline internal or external in this series we will be using external style sheets so yeah that's a quick introduction to css if

well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate how we can change font styles using css so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running hey uh let's get started with fonts to change the font family there is a font family property now with fonts sans serif fonts tend to look better on the web there is a generic sans serif font that you can use now what you commonly see with font families many people list more than one value for their font family and there's a good reason for this so i'm going to list two fonts one font that i'm fond of is consoles so in case a web browser doesn't support this font it will use the next best font available so people tend to list either two or three fonts for a font family these are sort of like contingencies in case the first one doesn't work now a good resource for open source fonts is fonts.google.com let's take a look at this so you can search for any fonts that you may want to use one font that i do like is press start to p if i would like to use this font i just need the style sheet so i will select the style otherwise you can download the family go to view your selected families and copy this link then within the head of my html document i will paste that link let's head back to our style sheet so i will change the header of my webpage so within my h1 header tag i will list the font family property and set this to the name of this font press start to p and you don't necessarily have to use this specific font you can really use whatever fonts that you like and if i take a look at my web page it now is using that font and just as a contingency if a web browser doesn't support this font i can list a backup let's list console us for the contingency then maybe sans serif so you can list more than one font family just in case the first one doesn't work then a web browser will use the second one if that doesn't work then the third one here's a couple other things you can do with fonts you can set the font style to italic you can change the font weight there's bold lighter you can select a value let's pick bold you can set a text decoration this is an underline uh let's pick underline and there's various adjectives you can add to your underline like wavy or dotted you can also select a color for the text decoration like maybe cyan so you can also change the font size as well let's pick maybe 18 pixels for the font size well ladies and gentlemen that is how to change the font of your web page using css if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey uh welcome back in this video i'm gonna show you how we can add borders to html elements so to create a border we need to set a border style well the default is none but let's set this to maybe solid for a solid line there's a couple other styles too like dashed dotted double ridge groove inset and outset we can change the border width by setting the border width property to some amount of pixels maybe five you can change the border color border dash color and pick a color i like gold let's stick with gold you can round to the corners by setting a border radius border dash radius the higher the number the smoother the rounding and i would like to add a little bit of spacing between my letters and my border so i can add some padding so we have a little bit of spacing between our text and our border now let's change our h1 header tag you can specify a border side such as top bottom left right border so we have bottom top left right i will set the border top style to maybe dotted i'll do the same thing with the bottom because i think it'll look cool and maybe the left side as well border left style let's make this i don't know double with the width color and radius you can also specify a side as well so let's change specifically the left border border dash left width and i'll set this to 10 pixels and i'll change the color to border left color i like silver let's pick that so yeah that's how to add borders to html elements whatever element you would like to add a border to you can set a given style and we covered a few of them solid is a very basic border you can change the width color radius and you can add padding and you do have the capability to change specific sides of the border such as top bottom left right so yeah everybody that's how to customize borders using css if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you a few useful things we can do with backgrounds using css so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey welcome back so in this video i'm going to show you how we can change the background color set a linear gradient and how we can set an image as our background so like we discussed in previous videos you can set the background color by changing the background color property and set this to some color of your choosing now another option is to set a linear gradient the property name is background and the value is linear gradient and within the parentheses you can add two or more colors perhaps sky blue and light green that's kind of nice but unfortunately this background repeats itself once it reaches the last element so we can actually change that with another property and to change that we can set the background repeat property to a value of no repeat here's another issue now we have all of this white space after our last element so there is another property if we would like to stretch this background background attachment and the value is fixed so we can resize this window add the background will adjust dynamically we can change the direction in which the colors head so we will precede our colors with two either top bottom left or right so two top would reverse these colors so green is at the top blue is at the bottom or to left or to right pretty cool right so this time i'm going to apply these colors to the h1 header tag as well as the ptag so the background of these elements is this linear gradient but not the background of the body of our html document i'm gonna change this color from light green to white for both and with the p tag let's say two left instead okay now this is how we can set an image as our background so find an image that you like here's a picture of central park and i placed this image along with my index.html file as well as my css file so i will set the background image to a value of url you can place an external url in here but since these files are right next to each other i only have to list the file name my background dot jpg but this is probably going to be a different name for you okay so this image is gigantic i'm going to copy background repeat and background attachment and i will set the background position to center but then i would like this image to expand and shrink based on the size of the window so there's one more property that we need and that is background size and we will set this to cover okay now if i resize this window this image will resize dynamically so yeah everybody that's a little bit about backgrounds using css you can set a background color you can set the background to a linear gradient and you can even set an image as your background so yeah those are a few things you can do to change the background using css if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey welcome back margins margins are the space around an element here's what we're gonna do we're going to create two boxes i'll use a div element and give this development an id of box one and let's do the same thing for box two but change one to two and within each box we will generate some random content so type lorem and then tab to generate some sample text and do the same thing for box two okay that's everything we'll need within our html document within our css document let's style both of our boxes so let's begin with box one and we'll just copy everything over to box two so i would like a border of five pixels solid a width of 250 a height of 250. let's change the font size to 22 pixels and change the background pick a background color that you like okay let's copy this and paste it for box two so change box one to box two and i would recommend picking a different color okay we have box one and box two margins are the space around an element you can see that we naturally have a little bit of margin between these boxes the body element of our document has about 8 pixels worth of margin and let's take a look at that so i'm going to style our body and add a border maybe 2 pixel solid this is the boundary of our body wherever this border is so we have 8 pixels of margin outside of our border we can actually get rid of that so that these boxes are touching the sides of the viewport by setting margin within our body to zero pixels and these boxes are now touching the sides of our viewport so margin is the space around an element but margin is easily confused with padding padding is the space between the content and the border for example i'll add 10 pixels worth of padding to box one this space between the content and the border is padding and i'll just casually increase the padding just so it's more visible this space between the content and the border is padding it's easily confused with margin now margin is the space outside of a border we can select margin top bottom left right let's begin with top margin top i'll set this to 50 pixels so we're saying at the top of this element add 50 pixels worth of margin this element along with any elements underneath it will be pushed down by 50 pixels likewise i can apply this to the left and this will push this element 50 pixels to the left same thing goes with the bottom any elements underneath this margin will be pushed by this amount and there's also margin right but there's nothing to the right of this element because it is a block level element if i need to apply some amount of margin all around an element i can just say margin then that amount 50 and then we don't need four separate lines this would do the same thing in one line you can use percentages instead of pixels so that way when you resize this window it resizes dynamically so if i were to set margin left to 50 this margin will use up as much space as 50 of the width of our window okay one trick if you need this element to stick to the right hand side of your window you can set margin to auto and the margin on the left hand side will be automatically calculated so it's going to push this element to the right this will all be margin and likewise you can do the same thing with margin right then this element will stick to the left-hand side because the margin on the right is taking up all the space on the right side of this element here's a trick if you set both margin left and margin right to auto then this element will stay horizontally centered in the middle of your document so yeah that's a little bit about margins and if you ever forget how margins work if you right click on an element then go to inspect there will be a diagram right here so it shows that our content is 250 by 250 any padding if there is any the width of the border and the width of the margin and here are the values so yeah that's a little bit about margins it is the space around an element so yeah those are margins if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey uh let's talk about the float property the float property positions an element to the left or right side of a container it's popular for wrapping elements around images in this brief example i have three images and two paragraph elements i think this would look a lot better if this text wrapped around these images so what i could do is that whatever element i would like to select i can apply a float property any elements that are floating are taken out of the normal flow of a document and all elements that follow after will wrap around them by setting my images to float left all images will gravitate towards the top left corner of my document it's as if we're reading them from left to right or we could float right then we're reading this right to left let me give you a different example images are inline elements here's a different example with block level elements this time we will create three boxes using a pair of div tags let's set the class equal to box we will have box one box two and box three and let's create some sample text create a pair of paragraph tags i'll type lorem and then tab to generate some sample text copy this paragraph and paste it two additional times let's say okay let's style our boxes so to select a class type dot then the name of the class so let's create some boxes the width will be 100 pixels the height will be 100. let's give this a border of 1 pixel solid change the font size to something readable like 40 pixels i'll text align center and let's change the color background select a color i'll pick tomato because i like tomatoes divs are block level elements after each element the entire width of our viewport is reserved to display this element so if i give our class box the float property it will be taken out of the normal flow of a document and all elements that follow after will also follow that pattern so they will float and wrap around any elements from left to right top to bottom if we're using left or this was float right it will be red right to left top to bottom if you would like a stopping point where your elements are no longer floating you can use the clear property so let's say with our paragraph tags i would like this text to stop floating i will use the clear property and set this to left if we're floating left or to the right if we're floating right or you can set this to both so yeah basically speaking with the float property it positions an element to the left or right side of a container and it's popular for wrapping elements around images if you need to stop floating you can use the clear property which is what we did here so yeah that is the float property if you found this video helpful you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey yeah let's talk about css positioning let's begin by creating two boxes i'll use a div element let's name this first box box one and create a second box box two let's also create a whole lot of paragraphs because we'll want a scroll bar so if you need some sample text you can type lorem and then tab okay so copy this line and paste it maybe like 10 times that should be good enough and let's copy all of these paragraphs and paste them underneath our boxes doesn't really matter how many you have we just need a lot of room to work with okay let's design these two boxes now that we have a lot of sample text let's begin with box one i'll give this a border of one pixel solid a height of 300 pixels a width of 300 pixels and pick a background color any color is fine now let's style box two and we'll make this smaller 100 by 100 and a different color i like tomatoes so there is a position property where we can format the layout of an element there's five that we'll discuss absolute fixed relative static and sticky static is easy that's the default any element that is positioned statically is in its normal state so there's no change here now relative we can move this element relative to some point of origin the point of origin of box one our blue box is the top left corner and there are offsets top bottom left and right if i would like to displace this element down and to the right by 50 pixels i can set the top offset to 50 pixels or some other unit of measurement and then offset it from the left by 50 pixels as well so this does create an empty vacuum of where this element was so think of this as a reserved space take a look at this what if i were to set top and left to an even greater number like 150 this element will cover other elements underneath so that's something you need to take into consideration or we could do the same thing with box two now box two is displaced and this corner the top left corner is the point of origin okay now let's discuss absolute positioning any element that is positioned absolutely will be taken out of the flow of the document so with box 2 let's set the position to absolute so you probably noticed that all of this text is running underneath this element it's as if our document is ignoring box two it's kind of like it's ethereal or a ghost or something and if i were to set a position i'll set the top to zero then this box appears at the top of our document and here's the reason why any element that is absolutely positioned will search for any parents that are positioned non-statically if it does not have a parent it will instead use the viewport we're setting the point of origin for box 2 to the top left corner of our webpage because it doesn't have any direct parents that are positioned non-statically now if i set top to 150 pixels then the point of origin is the top left corner still and it will be pushed down by 150 pixels and maybe to the left by 150 pixels as well what if i would like box 2 to be positioned in the center of box one okay what i'm going to do is make box 2 a child of box 1 by placing box 2 within box 1. however box 1 is positioned statically that's the default so i will set the position to maybe let's say relative and let's uh set top to 100 and left to 100 there box 2 is now within the center and the cool thing about this is that if i move box 1 box 2 will follow and stay in that same place it's positioned absolutely so let's set the left offset to maybe 250 there and box 2 is staying in the same place then maybe the top by 250 as well that's kind of the idea behind absolute positioning it searches for a parent that is positioned non-statically such as relative or some of the other positions i'm about to discuss if it doesn't find a parent it uses the viewport so we'll keep box 2 right there next we have fixed fixed will stay in position of your viewport so even when you scroll it's going to stay wherever you set it uh let's set this in the top right corner so top zero pixels and right zero pixels so this box will stay in the top right corner of my viewport so that is fixed and lastly we have sticky anything that has a sticky position will stick to an edge of your viewport when you scroll past so if i set this to top then this element is going to stick to the top when we scroll down past it but currently it's in its normal place but when i scroll past it will stick to the top of my viewport and then when i scroll up past it it will snap back into place or we can set this to the bottom when i scroll up past this element it will stick to the bottom then snap back into place or we could combine them both so if i scroll down past this element it will stick to the top if i scroll up past the element it will stick to the bottom so that is the sticky position so yeah everybody those are a few positions in css if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey pseudo classes a pseudo class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected elements what the heck does that mean so with elements elements can be in a special state like if you hover over them you click on them things of that nature so let's create a hyperlink for this first example let's create a hyperlink that will take us to google because i can't think of anything else at the moment so let's set the href attribute equal to the url for google by default this hyperlink is blue but we can actually change that type the element you would like to change the css properties of followed by a colon and then we have access to all of these pseudo classes so a pseudo class is a special state so anything that is a link let's change maybe the color color what about lawn green i guess anything that is using an a element that is a link is now lawn green so if i click on this link it takes me to google anything that's visited is also another state a pseudo class and the default color is purple let's change that to a colon the pseudo class is visited maybe gray for the color like it's been disabled so the color is now gray since we've already visited this link what if we hover our cursor over this link that is another state a hover color what about tomato i like tomatoes so by hovering my cursor over this link the state of this element is now hover and these css properties will apply when this element is within this state and there's another useful one for hyperlinks and that is active if we were to hold down our mouse over this element then let's change the color to what about i don't know yellow so with active if i hold down the mouse then this link is active it's within the active state now let's create a button this time button click me so anything that's a button we'll use the pseudo class of hover this time and let's change the color to light gray so by hovering my mouse over this button it's going to change the color let's make that background color actually background color if you have a navigation bar or menu bar setup it's actually fairly useful to have the background color change based on what the user is hovering over to let them know that they can select something let's change the active pseudo class four buttons as well uh let's say if we click on this then it will be white cool all right here's another we'll need a list it doesn't matter what kind of list i'll just make an unordered list and let's add 10 list item elements this next pseudo class is really useful it is the m child pseudo class so with these list items i would like to change the background of selected elements think of a child as an element within an element so these list items are all siblings and what we're going to do is change the background color of a few selected elements we will select our list item and say that the nth child will be will have a background color of yellow as if we're selecting something so place a value as an argument within these parentheses these list items are all siblings so let's say that the first child will have a background color of yellow so i will pass in a one or two three four five you get the idea this is really useful with javascript because you can place a variable within here and then increment or decrement to the variable so you can select a given item from a list i'm just going to turn this into a comment real quick now with this next one let's say that the color will be sky blue and i would like to apply this css property to all even siblings and let's do the same thing with all odd siblings and let's make the color what about powder blue so in this way we can alternate the highlighting of our elements so that they may be easier to read this next value is going to be somewhat strange it's a formula that we can pass in as an argument so what if i need every third element highlighted i would say 3n n is the current number that we're on so elements three six and nine are highlighted if we change this to four n every fourth element is highlighted five n is every fifth element you can place an offset too if i need this to start at one i would add plus one or plus two plus three plus four so yeah you can pass in a formula as an argument to the nth child pseudo class and this is useful if you need some sort of pattern so yeah those are pseudo classes it's a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element so yeah those are pseudo classes if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave random comments down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey let's talk about shadows there are two varieties of shadows we'll discuss text shadows and box shadows in this example i have a basic h1 element let's begin with text shadows with this css property there are three numbers and a color that follow the first three are in pixels and then pick whatever color you want for a shadow maybe gray the first number is for the positioning on the x-axis a positive number will result in the shadow being moved to the right a negative number to the left the second number is for the y axis a positive number will move your shadow below your text a negative number and your shadow will appear above the text and you can combine these two if i need the shadow to the bottom and to the right i will set these first two numbers to be positive the larger the numbers the greater the displacement of your shadow this third number is for the spread a higher number results in a further spread so if i set this to 15 we can barely see our shadow anymore maybe let's set that to five that's a decent looking shadow okay you can also add more than one shadow i'm thinking for this example we'll create a sort of fire effect around our text so maybe i'll set the color to be yellow and i would like the shadow to appear directly around our text so i will set the first two values to zero and the spread to five or some other number so this kind of looks like our text is glowing so separate each individual shadow with a comma and i would like a red shadow this time and i'll place this directly above our text and set a spread to maybe five yeah there we go that's not a bad looking effect okay now let's discuss box shadows it's the same values as before there's three numbers and a color except this shadow will appear around our entire element let's set this to black i would like the shadow to appear to the bottom right of this element so five five and a spread of five works that's not too bad remember with box shadows the entire element is going to have that shadow effect so you may want to consider setting width and height properties of your elements we can set this so that a shadow appears when you hover your cursor over this element but you need to use the hover selector so h1 colon hover so if i were to hover my cursor over this element then this shadow will appear so it's kind of like a 3d pop-out effect so yeah those are shadows we discussed text shadows and box shadows if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey yeah everybody in this video i thought we could do something a little bit different in this video i'm going to direct you to a useful resource in which you can use free icons for your websites the name of this website is font awesome this isn't a sponsorship or anything like that i just tend to like to use this website for free icons so there is a free version i'm going to start for free and you just need to set up an account so enter an email address and then create and use this kit then it's just a matter of verifying your email address to create an account after signing in you'll need to add your kits code to a project this is a small script so i'm going to copy this kit code and within the head of my html document i'm going to paste it and now we can search for some icons at the top menu of this website we'll go to icons and we can search a lot of these you do need a paid account but there's a lot of free icons as well so let's look up any free icons let's look for a home so click on an icon you can select a size and a background color and choose this icon click on start using this icon all you have to do is copy this html code and then someplace within the body of your document you can paste it and we now have that house icon so let's search for a few more how about twitter select a size and a background start using this icon copy the html code and then paste it okay one more how about youtube so again select an icon select a size select the background start using this icon copy this code and paste it okay let's style some of these elements let's change the color of our twitter icon so this portion here is the class name f a dash twitter so type dot for classes f a dash twitter and let's change the color property i think aqua is fairly close to the original logo color and let's do the same thing with youtube so dot fa youtube and i will change the color to red and you can add really any css properties we can also turn these into hyperlinks so i will surround one of these elements with a pair of a tags then i will set the href attribute equal to a url then when i click on this icon it takes me to youtube it wouldn't be a bad idea to play some of these within the header or the footer of your webpage so yeah those are font awesome icons and how to style them using css so if this video helped you out please be sure to help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey uh here's a few transformations that you may be interested in let's begin by creating a simple box i'll use a div element and assign this a unique id of box one and within this box we'll say hi within my style sheet i will select box one i'll give this a border of 4 pixels solid a width of 250 pixels and a height of 250 pixels as well let's change the font size to something larger like 225 pixels we will change the text alignment to center and change the background too pick a color that you like to work with transformations there is a transform property and you can select a transformation that you like let's begin with translate x you pass in an amount of pixels to translate your element on the x-axis if i set this to 50 pixels this element will be translated to the right by 50 pixels or a negative number for a left translation okay let's select translate y and do the same thing this transformation moves elements up or down on the y-axis or you could combine them both and that is just simply translate but you pass in two numbers between the parenthesis so this combines both an x and y translation we can rotate on the x-axis you pass in an angle like 180 degrees so that is a rotation on the x-axis there is also a y-axis rotation and a z-axis rotation we can scale on the x-axis scale x one is the default two means two hundred percent so this image will stretch twice as wide or three times as wide there is scale y and that will stretch on the y-axis or you could combine them both with simply scale if i set both of these values to 2 our image is twice as big we can skew on a given axis skew x and then pass in an amount of degrees like 45 degrees we can skew on the y axis or we can do both pass in two values within skew let's say 20 degrees for both there's also matrix matrix is a little more complex there are six values that we can pass in and they start in this order the first value is for scale x the second is for skew y skew x scale y translate x and translate y the first number is for scale x and the fourth numbers for scale y so i'm going to set this to one for one hundred percent so if these are both zero or at least one of them is zero then this image is going to disappear so matrix combines the following scale x skew y skew x scale y translate x translate y so using matrix you can add more than one transformation let's say i need this scaled twice as big and translated let's make that a little more drastic maybe 250 or i could skew this too so yeah those are some simple transformations whatever you would like translated just place this property within an element and you can select one of these based on what you need so yeah those are some simple transformations in css if this video helped you out you can help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate a few simple animations using css so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey y'all let's create some very basic animations i'll create a simple box i'll use a div element and give this element a unique id of box one and within this box let's say hi and within our style sheet let's set the box 1 element to have a width of 250 pixels same thing goes with the height let's change the background to maybe red i'll give the font a size of 225 and text align center to use an animation we first well have to create an animation and we can do that by using the key frames rule so at keyframes and then follow this with a unique name for your animation for this first example let's have this element slide into place from the right i'll name this my slide something unique two keywords that we can add to our animation are from and two and follow each with a set of curly braces from will be any properties you would like to apply to this element when you begin the animation the two keyword are the ending properties let's have margin left begin at one hundred percent so the margin on the left of our element is going to take up 100 of the width of our window and this animation will end with margin left being 0 there will be no margin on the left of this element this will be a gradual transition between these two properties but we have to set a length of time that this animation is going to take but before that we have to specify an animation by setting the animation property to the name of your animation mine is my slide and we need to set a duration animation duration let's say that this entire animation will take 5 seconds 5s and there we go with our keyframes there is a gradual change between these properties anything within from and2 we can repeat this animation as many times as what we would like animation iteration count you can set this to 1 2 3 or infinite so this animation will loop when you set the animation iteration count to infinite a couple other things you can do too you can add animation play state and the default is running but you can set this to paused and the animation will pause in place but let's keep that at running you can add a delay animation delay maybe we'll have this begin after one second so it's been one second then the animation begins i'll keep that at zero okay this next one is animation timing function so right now our animation is occurring linearly we could have this e is in so this accelerates but doesn't slow down ease out where we begin quickly and then slowly decelerate ease will do both it accelerates and then decelerates near the end or linear where it's a constant animation there is a shortcut where you can apply all six of these properties and just to demonstrate i will place all of these within one giant comment block so beginning in this order we begin with the duration this time let's say three seconds then the timing function linear a delay if you need one i will keep that as zero the iteration count that will be infinite the place date running then the animation my slide so this is a shortcut where you can combine all six of these separate properties you can also place this animation within a pseudo class in this next example i would like this element to only be animated while i have the cursor over this element so i can use a pseudo class for that so box one and the pseudo class of hover and i will place my animation within that pseudo class and then we should probably switch these margins around so that it slides to the right instead this animation will begin if i place my cursor over this image or we can set this to active it's going to play if i click on it box 1 colon active and then let's place our animation within it so nothing's happening until i click down on this image but once i let go the animation ends so you can combine animations with pseudo classes let's create a couple more animations how about a rotation let's name this my rotate so you can use percentages too you don't necessarily have to use both from and two let's say that once this animation reaches 100 i would like to apply the transform property and we will perform an x rotation of 360 degrees so let's set the animation to my rotate so that is an x rotation let's do this with y and let's get rid of that here is a y rotation and a z rotation let's change the opacity so at keyframes my opacity okay this time we will set this to 50 then your animation will have these properties revert to what they originally were when you began the animation so at fifty percent let's set the opacity to zero so this will fade out then fade in see if i set this to 100 this will fade out slowly and then snap back into place but if you set it to 50 there will be a gradual transition and then it's going to revert back after 50 let's change the scale of our element at keyframes my scale let's have our image shrink and then grow back in place using transform scale 0.5 to 0.5 so this will shrink and then grow and lastly let's change the colors this will be a challenge round keyframes my color change we'll go through the colors red orange yellow green blue and purple so let's have this begin at zero percent we will have the background color be red then at 20 this will be orange 40 will be yellow 60 will be green 80 will be blue and 100 will be purple actually since our element is beginning as the color red we don't necessarily need this specific portion okay let's try this my color change so we should be able to go through these colors and then it becomes red again at the end so yeah those are some simple animations in order to use an animation you have to create an animation so you use at keyframes and then come up with a unique animation name and then set some properties on what you need exactly so yeah those are some very basic animations in css if this video helped you out you can

6RuzhtsbSIg,Learn CSS borders in 2 minutes 🔲,2021-09-02T14:14:16Z,"Hey, uh, welcome back. In this video, I'm going to show you how we can add borders to HTML elements. So, to create a border, we need to set a border style. Well, the default is none, but let's set this to maybe solid for a solid line. There's a couple other styles, too, like dashed, dotted, double, ridge, groove, inset, and outset. We can change the border width by setting the border width property to some amount of pixels, maybe five. You can change the border color, border dash color, and pick a color. I like gold. Let's stick with gold. You can round the corners by setting a border radius. border dash radius. The higher the number, the smoother the rounding. And I would like to add a little bit of spacing between my letters and my border. So I can add some padding. So we have a little bit of spacing between our text and our border. Now let's change our H1 header tag. You can specify a border side such as top, bottom, left, right. Border. So we have bottom, top, left, right. I will set the border top style to maybe dotted. I'll do the same thing with the bottom because I think it'll look cool. And maybe the left side as well. Border left style. Let's make this I don't know double with the width color and radius. You can also specify a side as well. So let's change specifically the left border. Border dashleft width. And I'll set this to 10 pixels. And I'll change the color, too. Border left color. I like silver. Let's pick that. So, yeah, that's how to add borders to HTML elements. Whatever element you would like to add a border to, you can set a given style, and we covered a few of them. Solid is a very basic border. You can change the width, color, radius, and you can add padding. And you do have the capability to change specific sides of the border such as top, bottom, left, right.

xv-bBxaa7WU,CSS tutorial for beginners 🎨,2021-09-02T13:09:04Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys everything you need to know to get started using css so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm okay let's do this css css is an acronym for cascading style sheets it's defined as a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as html i stole that definition from wikipedia i like to think of building a website very similar to building a house we need three things structure style and functionality we can use html for structure this would be like the skeleton the frame of our house with css we can add styles such as colors decorations lighting and with javascript we can add functionality in our house analogy this would be similar to plumbing heating electricity but in this video we're going to focus on style now to work with css you'll need a text editor i just so happen to be using vs code so let's jump over to that here we are within vs code or some other text editor that you prefer so you'll need an html document to work with if you don't have one just go to new file and then you can create one just make sure the extension ends with html there are three ways in which we can apply css properties to html elements inline internal or external external works the best especially if you have a large website we'll need some sample text to work with so let's create a title for this webpage using a pair of h1 header tags this is my website and let's create maybe four paragraphs as well so these are in pairs of p tags and we'll need some sample text if you need some sample text type lorem and then tab to generate some sample text so let's copy that line and paste it three additional times okay there we go so we can apply css inline so whatever element you would like to apply css properties to within the opening tag you would set the style attribute equal to some css properties within quotes let's say that i would like to change the background color of my webpage so within the opening body element i will set the style attribute equal to one or many css properties let's change the background color so type background color colon and then end it with a semicolon and then we will list either a color name like black you can use rgb values and these come in groups of three so black would be three zeros so depending on what values you have here this will change the color or there's hexadecimal values hexadecimal values are preceded with a hashtag and there are six digits that follow so black is 60 rows where white is six fs but you can always look up a color picker and then just copy the values after you find a color that you like it's a lot easier perhaps we would like a black background so i'll just keep the simple and use color names instead but you can use rgb values and hexadecimal values okay now i would like to make my h1 header tag white so i will set the style attribute equal to the color property this time color is for the font color background color is for well the background color so color white now with our paragraph tags let's apply more than one css property so let's set the style equal to and list whatever properties you would like to apply within double quotes and then separate each with a semicolon uh let's begin with the background color let's make this maybe gray and let's change the color to what about white then i'm just going to copy the style attribute and paste it for each of these paragraphs this is somewhat redundant but there's an easier way of doing this with internal style sheets to apply an internal style sheet within the head of your html document you'll need a pair of style tags whatever element you would like to apply css properties to you will list that element for example the body then follow that with a pair of curly braces then you will type the name of a css property like background color and set it to some value like black and then we no longer need this style attribute there we go you may need to save and refresh this time let's apply css to the h1 header tag via an internal style sheet uh so let's copy this value and get rid of it okay this time we would like to change our h1 header tags so list that here within our style element h1 curly braces list any css properties within the curly braces color white and we'll do the same thing with our paragraph tags so let's get rid of these so type p curly braces and then we will paste the css properties so you can apply more than one css property just place them within the curly braces so there we go and you can see that this is a lot less redundant instead of making all of the changes in line you can place them within an internal style sheet now the last method which i think is the best method is an external style sheet so we will create a new css file so i'm going to right click go to new file let's name this style.css i'm going to copy everything within my style element and then get rid of our style element tags and within the style sheet we will paste everything that we just copied now we just need to link our html file with our css file and to do that within the head tag we will type link rel equals rel is an attribute that names a relationship of the linked document to the current document so rel will be stylesheet then set the href attribute equal to the relative file path of your css file they're right next to each other i only need to list the file name there we go we have applied css properties via an external style sheet and this is the preferred way of doing things so you can reuse this one style sheet for many different html pages so let's say that we create a new html document like page2.html by the way if you need to generate the body of your html document if you're using vs code you can type exclamation point and then tab let's create a really quick html document for page two this is page two and then i'll create two paragraphs let's say okay i'm going to open page 2 with live server and take a look page 2 does not have any css filing but we can reuse the same css file all we have to do is link our html file with our css file within the head element i am just going to make that link so this is really convenient if you have to make any changes to your website let's say that you need to make all of the pages on your website instead of the background color black let's say maybe gray well you can just make that change here and that one change will apply to all of your html documents so you only need to make that change in one place that's why external style sheets are really useful one unique feature of css is that we can target any specific element by id or a class that they may be in any element that has these names will have these styles but what if i would like maybe one of these paragraphs to have a different font color i can give one of these paragraphs a unique id so within the opening tag i will set the id attribute equal to a unique identifier let's say p1 because it's well the first paragraph so then to target that specific id i will type that id and let's set the color equal to what about tomato now for practice let's give each of these a unique id let's say p1 p2 p3 and p4 if we need to change p2's color to tomato well then we target p2 what about p3 just change the id to p3 and then p4 so you can target a specific element by id you just have to be sure to fill out that id attribute or you can target anything within the same class a class is like a group in this example let's say that all odd numbered paragraphs should be read all even-numbered paragraphs should be blue so i'm going to instead give these each a class you can keep the ids if you want to so type class equals the first paragraph will be odd class odd the second paragraph will be class even then odd then even so to target elements by a class you type dot the name of the class so anything within the odd class let's say we'll have a color of red and i'm going to get rid of this tomato color our first paragraph is within the odd class the same applies with our third paragraph and then i would like to make any elements within the even class blue color blue so our second paragraph is blue and our fourth paragraph is blue so yeah everybody that is a quick introduction to css it means cascading stylesheets we can apply css properties in one of three ways inline internal or external in this series we will be using external style sheets so yeah that's a quick introduction to css if you found this video

yHX-UwAnoqk,Learn HTML span &amp; div in 2 minutes 🏁,2021-09-01T12:49:52Z,hey welcome back in this video i'm going to explain the span and div tags let's begin with span span adds markup to text or portion of a document anything that i surround with a pair of spam tags i can apply markup or some effect too so in my example document i have a header and three paragraphs what if i would like this specific sentence to be i don't know red well what i could do is surround this sentence in my document with a pair of spam tags so i need an opening spam tag and a closing spam tag and that sentence ends right here and within the span tag i can change some of the attributes of this sentence um so i would like to change maybe the style i'll set the style color equal to red now you probably do want this closing tag if you do not have this closing tag your span will take up this entire section so basically that's what span is it adds markup to text or a portion of a document div is very similar except it divides a division of a document so what if i would like to change the background color of these three paragraphs well what we learned in the last video on colors is that we could set the style background color equal to some shade of gray maybe this value this does work and i could just copy this and paste it for each of these paragraphs or another way of doing this is that i can surround these three paragraphs with a pair of div tags so we need an opening div tag and a closing div tag and then i will apply this style attribute to the opening div tag and it will apply this attribute to anything between these div tags so yeah that's basically what the span and div tags do span adds markup to text or portion of a document div defines a division of a document so yeah that's span and div in html
6IQz_cF-Slk,Learn HTML colors in 3 minutes 🖍️,2021-09-01T12:49:24Z,"Hey. Uh, what's going on everybody? In this video, I'm going to show you how we can add color to a web page. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. All right. Now, here's how we can add color to a web page. We'll be talking a little bit about CSS, but we'll cover this more in depth in the CSS series. I thought this would be a good place for us to introduce colors because we'll be able to color things like buttons and forms and whatnot. Here's how to add some color to a web page. Within the opening tag of an element of your choosing, there is a style attribute. And within double quotes, we can add CSS properties. For my website, I would like to change the background color to black because I think it would look cool. So, within double quotes, list the CSS property you would like to change, background color. After the colon, you can either add a color name, RGB values, or hexadimal values. Let's just say the color black. There we go. We can no longer see my website. Let's change the font color of these individual H1 header tags. Again, it's the same process as before. Style equals within double quotes list the CSS property you would like to add. I would like to add color this time to change the font color. And I will pick red. There we go. This time let's use RGB values. So again, style attribute equals the CSS property you would like to change. To instead use an RGB value, type RGB parenthesis. Then I would recommend looking up a color picker and you can pick a color of whatever you would like. Uh what about blue? Perhaps that shade of blue. So RGB values are in a group of three, a triad. So I will copy these three numbers and paste them within the parenthesis of RGB. And this second H1 header tag is now that specific shade of blue. I tend to prefer to use RGB values or hexodimal values over color names because you have more variety. Now let's use hexodimal values. Style equals the CSS property of color. So hexodimal values always start with a hashtag. What about green? So, we'll have red, blue, and green. And I will copy this number. They are in groups of six. And well, yeah, it's green now. Cool, right? Okay. Now, let's change both the font color and the background color of this paragraph. Within the opening tag of this paragraph element, we will set the style attribute equal to any CSS properties within double quotes. Let's change the background color first. background dash color space. I'll set this to dark gray which is 2 two2 222. Then to add multiple CSS properties, separate each with a semicolon. And this time I will change just the color and I'll use the same shade of green. All right. Well, there we go. So yeah, everybody, that's how to add some colors to your web page. There's more advanced things we can do when we reach the video series on CSS, but what you can do for now within the opening tag of an element of your choosing, set the style attribute equal to whatever CSS properties you would like to add within quotes. So yeah, that's how to add color to a web page.

5mqHzWIzruM,C hypotenuse calculator program 📐,2021-09-01T12:37:50Z,all right welcome back everybody in this video we're going to write a small practice program to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle we'll need the help of our math.h header file because we'll need access to some useful math functions more specifically the square root function let's declare all of the variables that we'll need we'll need sides a b and c and these will be of the double data type a b c we'll ask the user to enter in sides a and b print f enter side a and then we will use scanf so the format specifier for a double is l f then i would like to insert a value within a so i need to use the address of operator then our variable a okay let's do the same thing for side b enter side b and store the user input within variable b the formula to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the square root of a squared plus b squared so we will set c equal to the square root function and within the parentheses we will say a times a plus b times b and then we will display c side c and the format specifier for a double is l f and we are displaying c and well let's try it so side a let's say is three side b is four that means side c is five so yeah i thought that would be a good practice program for us to get used to accepting user input if this video helped you out help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
REtiFfgj8SU,C circle circumference program ⚪,2021-08-27T15:11:56Z,hey everyone here's a quick program that we can make to calculate the circumference of a circle i thought this would be good practice for us now that we know how user input works let's declare all of the variables that we'll need i'm going to create a constant variable named pi and it's going to be of the double data type pi equals 3.14159 the reason that i'm making this a constant is that i don't want anybody else to be able to change the value of pi and let's declare but not assign a radius quite yet we'll have the user type that in and double circumference this will be calculated and displayed so we will need to prompt the user to enter in a radius i'll proceed this with a new line enter radius of a circle and then i will use scanf to accept some user input we need to list the format specifier of doubles which is lf comma address of operator radius then the formula for radius is 2 times pi times radius and then we will display our circumference using printf circumference then we need a format specifier we're displaying a double so the format specifier is lf comma circumference and let's run it enter well the radius of a circle uh let's say that our radius is 10 maybe this is 10 i don't know meters all right our circumference is 62.83 meters now why not take this a step further let's also calculate the area of the circle i wasn't planning on taking it this far but hey let's calculate that as well for practice so let's declare a double variable named area and we will calculate what areas the formula for the area of the circle is pi times radius squared pi times radius times radius then let's display the area so area we're using the double format specifier and area then let's add some new line characters to separate everything enter the radius of a circle let's say 10 meters the circumference is 62.83 meters and the area is 314.15 meters all right everybody that is a small program to calculate the circumference of a circle and i guess the area as well just because well why not so yeah if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
-kXZvKxs9oA,Learn HTML lists in 4 minutes 📋,2021-08-21T15:23:45Z,hey welcome back in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create lists in html there's three lists we're going to talk about unordered ordered and description lists let's begin with unordered lists to create an unordered list we need a pair of ul tags for an unordered list and between these ul tags we can create individual list items and we use a pair of li tags for each item we would like to add to our list so what's an example of an unordered list one thing that comes to mind is a shopping list like a grocery list because well i'm kind of hungry right now it's breakfast time let's say that we're going to bake a pizza and we need a list of ingredients we need pizza dough so add an item between this pair of li tags and we now have one bulleted item within our unordered list and let's create another item so we can just copy and paste this pair of li tags and create a new list item what about tomato sauce and then maybe cheese and toppings point being to create an unordered list you need a pair of ul tags and with each list item you would like to add to your unordered list you just place within a pair of li tags for list item an ordered list is very similar except we use old tags so we need an opening ol tag and a closing ol tag so by default each list item is going to be numbered so let's say that we have a to-do list to add a list item we need to use a pair of li tags perhaps this is a schedule of what we have to do in the morning we have to eat breakfast that could be one list item so to add another item we need another pair of li tags then maybe we need to take a shower so each of these is numbered and they're in ascending order and then we want to what about leave for work okay so yeah that is an ordered list the order of the list items does matter and we can change the type too within the opening oel tag there is a type attribute we can set each list item to a number a letter or roman numerals if i would instead like letters i can just set the type equal to a and our list items are now marked with the letter and we have description lists we need a pair of dl tags for description lists and instead of using an li tag for each list item we use a pair of dt tags for description term and d tags for description definition so for a term that is d t and then we add a definition to this term let's say we have a list of web dev languages for a term we need an opening dt tag and a closing dt tag and then we can add a definition to this term so that would be dd description definition between the opening and closing dd tags we can add a definition to this term let's say that this adds structure to a web page and then to create another term and definition pair we can just copy this let's add css this adds style to a web page then javascript this adds functionality to a web page with description lists each list item is a pair of terms and definitions the last thing i'm going to show you you can create a nested list within a list so let's say i would like to add a sub list of individual toppings to our unordered list within the list item we just create a new list let's say that i would like another unordered list so i need a pair of ul tags and what are some toppings we can place on our pizza so we need a list item what about pepperoni so we have a sub list going if you take a look on the webpage right now ah then maybe what about mushrooms next i like mushrooms and peppers i guess all right people those are how to create lists there's three types unordered ordered and description lists just use a pair of appropriate tags depending on the list you want to use so yeah everybody that's how to create different lists in html if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
SZfoOAv9tEo,Learn HTML text formatting in 2 minutes 💬,2021-08-21T15:06:21Z,all right welcome back everybody so in this video i'm going to show you all a few useful text formatting tags that you may be interested in we'll need some sample text to work with this is normal text we'll create additional lines of text so i'm going to surround this text with a pair of paragraph tags just so that when we add additional text they will be added to a new line let's copy this line and paste it nine additional times let's say there we go first set of text formatting tags that i'll show you is bold any text that you need to bold just surround that text with a pair of beat tags we need an opening b tag and a closing beats egg this is normal text and you can see that the word normal is bold uh let's change that to bold just so that it's more descriptive of what it does okay so any text you need bold just surround with a pair of b tags the next set of tags is italic surround any text that you need italic with a pair of eye tags this is italic text we have big this is big text we have small this is small text sub for subscript this is subscript text superscript the tag name is sup like you're saying sup to somebody this is superscript text we have inserted inserted is just underlined ins for inserted this is inserted text there is deleted deleted will create a line through some text this is deleted text and there's one more it looks like i miscounted there's also marked so we use a pair of mark tags any text that is marked is highlighted so yeah those are a few text formatting tags that i thought you should know if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
9E3I1URu6fc,C arithmetic operators ➗,2021-08-19T15:00:33Z,well well well welcome back so we need to talk about arithmetic operators because well this wouldn't be a full course without them so as you probably know arithmetic operators are well addition subtraction multiplication division and there's a few others too unique with programming such as modulus increment and decrement so let's go over a few let's say that we have int z and if we need to add two numbers we could say x plus y equals z and then display the sum which of course is seven so subtraction is well minus five minus two is three multiplication is an asterisk five times two equals ten okay now pay attention to this with division so 5 divided by 2 equals 2.5 right well that's where you're wrong it's 2 because we're storing the results within an integer and with integers we can only store whole numbers so we will lose that decimal portion it will be truncated there's a few things we'll need to change first we'll need to store the result within a float or a double and then let's display this percent f for a float okay another thing that we need to change too and that involves integer division if we're dividing by an integer we'll truncate that decimal portion there's one of two things we can do we can either change our divisor to a float or a double and that will solve that problem 2.5 or if we would like to keep this as an integer we can convert this integer to a float or double by preceding the divisor with float or double either one so if i would like to keep y as an integer and we divide x by y we will convert 2 into a float so 2.0 and store the result within float z and the result is 2.5 so if you're performing division with any integers you need to pay attention to integer division and you may need to cast your divisor as a float or as a double now we have modulus modulus gives you the remainder of any division five does not divide by two evenly int z equals x modulus y and if we display z so make sure to change your format specifier if you didn't the remainder of five divided by two is one if this was four four divides by two evenly and the result is going to be zero modulus gives you the remainder of any division it's actually pretty helpful to find if a number is even odd all you do is say modulus 2 or some variable containing the value of 2 either way and then we can increment or decrement a number by 1. if i need to increment x for some reason you'll see this when we get to the video on loops i could say x plus plus and then let's display x x incremented by one would be six and then let's decrement y y minus minus and y decremented by one equals one so yeah everybody those are a few arithmetic operators a lot of these are fairly simple you know addition subtraction multiplication and division do pay attention to integer division because that can throw off your program then there's also modulus increment and decrement if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
Hh_se2Zqsdk,Learn HTML images in 3 minutes 📷,2021-08-15T15:28:16Z,all right people here's how to add an image to a webpage find or download an image of your choosing i just so happen to have a picture of shrek within your folder containing your index.html file you're going to move or paste that image within the same folder and within the body element we're going to create a new element an image element within angle brackets type img for image this is a self closing tag and many elements have different attributes that we can change we need to change the source attribute of this image element the source attribute is src and we will set this equal to within double quotes the name of our image mine is shrek.png and then save what i like to do if i'm working with a webpage that has a lot of images i like to create a separate folder for my images this isn't necessary but if your image is located within a separate folder we need to find the file path relative to your index.html file so i'm going to create a new folder and let's name this images it will contain all the images from my webpage then i will move my image to my images folder so we can no longer locate this image we need to find the file path relative to the index.html file to look within my images folder i will precede the image name with forward slash the name of the folder images slash the name of the image and there it is personally if i'm working with a lot of images i like to place all of my images within one folder if you decide to do that as well you just need to precede the file name with the name of the folder that it's in here's my image but it's fairly massive we can change the width and height attributes if we need to i will change the height attribute height equals maybe 200 and that's a lot smaller hm maybe 300 that's a little bit better the height and the width will scale proportionately with each other but you can change them individually let's change the width width equals let's say 100 what we get is an extra skinny shrek and if i change this to maybe 600 well shrek is extra thick now so i will just only change the height attribute so that the width attribute scales proportionately now if somebody is visually impaired they may be using a screen reader to navigate a web page it would be good practice to add some alternative text that is read out loud by a screen reader so that is the alt attribute within double quotes i'll type a brief description of this image this is a picture of shrek so when you add an image it's considered good practice to add some alternative text you can also add a title too a title will be a small pop-up box that appears when you hover your cursor over an image to add a title set the title attribute equal to some text shrek is shrek see and then i'm going to save hover my cursor over the image and we can see a small pop-up box that has my title shrek is shrek see we can also turn an image into a hyperlink to turn this image into a hyperlink we need to surround our image element with an opening and closing a tag so open and close within the opening a tag there is an href attribute that we can set to a url of our choosing i think i'll set this hyperlink to the wikipedia page for shrek so just type in the url between these double quotes save then if i were to click on my image this will take me to the wikipedia page for shrek or some other url depending on what you type here so yeah that's how to add an image to a webpage within the body element you need to add an image element and then set the source equal to the image name if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
iLZOL-hmr7M,C format specifiers 🔧,2021-08-15T15:27:58Z,all right welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you while a few extra things that we can do with format specifiers using a format specifier within a printf statement we can define and format a type of data to be displayed to use a format specifier you use a percent sign then follow that percent sign with a certain character depending on the type of data you would like to display let's say that we have three variables maybe we have an online store or something like that so let's say that these are of the float data type and we'll have three items for sale item one and make up some price let's say that the first item is five dollars and seventy five cents and we have item two and this will be ten dollars even and then we have item three and this will be one hundred dollars and ninety nine cents so let's display item one item two and item three with a printf statement printf and within a string let's say item one colon space then i'll add a dollar sign wherever you would like to insert a value or variable you will use that format specifier the percent sign so after my dollar sign i'll add item one so that would be percent then for floats you need f and then after the string add comma item one then let's just make sure that this works so we're going to be formatting this output what if we don't want all the zeros we can set the decimal precision of a float or double after the format specifier add a dot and the amount of digits you would like to display if i would only like to display two digits after the percent i will add point two and this will only display two digits for the amount of cents that we owe okay now let's do the same thing for items two and three so item two item two item three item three okay then let's add a new line character because i forgot so new line new line and new line much better another thing that we can do with format specifiers is that we can set a minimum field width so just add a number after the percent sign let's say that i would like to allocate eight spaces worth of room to display my number so after the percent sign but before the decimal add how many spaces you would like to set for the minimum field width let's say eight and let's see the new output okay there we go however it's all right aligned if you would like this left aligned you would use a negative sign after the percent to left align all this this would be negative whatever number you would like to allocate so the number is left justified but we still have all of this room after so that's what a format specifier is it defines and formats a type of data to be displayed so place a format specifier within a string use a certain character for the type of data you would like to display you can set decimal precision for floats and doubles you can set a minimum field width to display your output if you would like to line things up like you can see here and you can left or right align your output so yeah those are format specifiers if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
Vtckgz38QHs,Learn Quick Sort in 13 minutes ⚡,2021-08-13T14:11:31Z,hey uh it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the quicksort algorithm in computer science yep so uh sit back relax and enjoy the show all right quick sort here's how quick sort is going to work we need an array or some other type of collection i have a simple unordered array what we do is that we'll pass our array as an argument into a quick sort function after passing our array as an argument to the quick sort function we need to pick a pivot there's different variations of quick sort we can either pick a pivot at the beginning the middle or at the end but with most standard quick sort algorithms we will set the pivot to be at the end of our array what we're trying to accomplish is that we need to find the final resting place of our pivot where is this value going to be and taking a look at this that would be right about here but we don't know that yet so to find the final resting place of this value our pivot here's what we can do we will declare and use two indices j and i j will begin at the start of our array i will be one less than the beginning of our array and that's going to be important later and we'll need the help of a temporary variable so we can swap some values all we're doing is checking to see if the value at j is less than our pivot if it's greater than our pivot or equal to our pivot we ignore it eight is greater than five we ignore this value and then increment j by one so during that last iteration i did not come into play yet but it will this round again we check to see if this value is less than our pivot which it is what we do now is increment i then what comes next is that we swap these two values i and j and we'll need the help of a temporary variable so take the value at i assign it to temp take the value at j assign it to i take the value within temp assign it to j then we can move on to the next iteration increments j we check to see if the value at j is less than our pivot which it is if that is the case we increment i swap these two values we'll repeat this process until j reaches our pivot then we can move on to the next step this here's the next step after our index j reaches our pivot we now know where the final resting place of our pivot is gonna be it's i incremented by one so we will increment i then swap the value at index of i with the value at our pivot our pivot is now within the correct place an easy way to tell is that all elements to the left of our pivot should be at less than our pivot but they're not necessarily going to be in order and that's fine they'll be organized later all elements to the right of our pivot should be greater than or equal to our pivot and like i said before they probably will not be in order the important thing is that elements to the left should be less than our pivot elements to the right should be greater than that's how we know the pivot's in the correct place now the next step we're going to create two sections two partitions the first partition will be all the elements from the beginning of our array up until our pivot but not including the pivot and our second partition will be all the elements after our pivot until the end of our array quicksort is a recursive algorithm we need to pass these partitions as arguments into the quick sort function remember that the quick sort algorithm is a recursive divide and conquer algorithm but unlike with merge sort with merge sort we create new subarrays with quick sort we will be sorting these arrays in place but we need to keep track of the beginning and ending indices of these partitions and then it's just a matter of repeating the same steps over again but we're going to instead use these partitions sections of our array i'll give you a quick demonstration of what the quicksort algorithm is going to look like to completion [Music] [Music] and that ladies and gentlemen was your visual representation of the quicksort algorithm let's code our own quick sort algorithm just to solidify our understanding of this topic all right people let's create a quick sort function you'll need an array to work with place some random numbers within that array and then some way to iterate and display the elements of your array i'm just using a symbol for each loop so after running this of course our array is not yet sorted so before we display the elements of our array let's invoke a quick sort function which we still need to declare defined there will be three arguments our array and the beginning and ending indices of our array so that would be zero for the beginning then to find the ending you can just say array dot length minus one let's declare this function private static void quick sort and let's rename some of these parameters we have our array of integers named array and this will be the starting index and this parameter will be the ending index so we have indices start and end now the base case this will use recursion will be if end is less than or equal to start then we will return and this is our base case eventually we won't be able to divide our array any further so that's when we stop and return with our quick sort function we'll need the assistance of a helper function that we will name partition let's copy our function declaration paste it and make a few changes so this will return an int the location of our pivot and the function name will be partition and the parameters are the same at the end of our partition helper function we'll return i i will be the location of our pivot but we'll get to that later okay so within our quick sort function we'll need to find the location of where to pivot int pivot and the partition function will be in charge of that partition is going to sort our array and find the pivot so all elements to the left will be smaller than our pivot all elements to the right will be larger so pass in our array we're sorting our array in place there's no need to create any sub-arrays we'll just pass in our original array as well as the start and end after we figure out where our pivot's going to be we can pass in each partition recursively back into the quick sort function so again we will invoke quick sort pass in our array the start of our left partition and the ending of our left partition and that is where pivot is minus one we do not want to include our pivot and then we will need to use quick sort on the right partition change start to pivot plus one because the pivot is already in place and then the end of our array in this variation of the quick sort function we will say that pivot is at the end it will always be at the end to begin with int pivot equals array at index of n we'll need two indices i and j we'll create index i equals start minus one and then we will iterate through our array and this is where we will declare int j our second index int j equals start and we will continue this for loop as long as j is less than or equal to the end of our array minus one then increment j by one what we're going to check is if array at index of j is less than our pivot if one of these elements is less than our pivot we want it on the left hand side of our pivot any numbers larger than our pivot should be on the right hand side so we will increment i by 1 and do a basic variable swap and we'll need the help of a temporary variable int temp equals array at index of i array at index of i equals array at index of j lastly array at index of j equals temp this is just a basic variable swap once all elements that are less than our pivot are on the left hand side and all elements that are larger than our pivot are on the right hand side what we will do now is increment i by one and then insert our pivot into its final resting place with another basic variable swap so let's copy this code then paste it and make a few changes intent equals array at index of i that's the same array at index of i equals array at index of end array at index event equals temp and that's it and then make sure you return i at the end that is the location of our pivot then after running this our array is now sorted via the quick sort algorithm in conclusion the quick sort algorithm moves smaller elements to the left of a pivot we recursively divide our array into two partitions and pass those partitions as arguments recursively into the quick sort function the runtime complexity of the quicksort algorithm actually varies in its best and average cases it runs in big o of n log n however in its worst case it can run in big o of n squared this is rare and it occurs if the array is already sorted or close to being sorted but most of the time it will run in big o of n log n and the space complexity of the quicksort algorithm is big o of log n this is due to recursion it uses more space than bubble sort selection sort and insertion sort even though it sorts in place that's because the quick sort algorithm uses recursion we're adding frames to the call stack which takes memory so yeah that is the quick sort algorithm if you found this video helpful please be sure to

aIQk1O08zpg,C variables 💰,2021-07-16T14:06:30Z,"Hey, uh, it's your bro. Hope you're doing well. And yeah, we're doing stuff with variables today in C. So, sit back, relax, and well, enjoy the show. Welcome back to another video. So, variables. Variables are allocated space in memory to store a value. We refer to a variable's name to access the stored value. That variable now behaves as if it was the value that it contains. But to create a variable, we first need to declare a name for a variable and then precede it with the type of data that we are storing. Creating a variable is done in two steps. Declaration and initialization. So we need to first declare a variable to allocate some space in memory to store a value. So we need to preede our variable name with the data type of what we plan on storing within this variable. If I need to store a whole integer, we would preede our variable name with int int for integer. And let's say that this is variable x. So this step is declaration. We are creating space in memory to store a value. And to actually store a value, that step is initialization. So we would take our variable name x in this example and set it equal to some value. So we declared that this variable is an integer. We can only store whole integers. Maybe the number 1 2 3. So this is initialization. Or you could combine these steps together. And let's create int Y. inty equals 321. This is both declaration and initialization. So creating and storing a variable takes two steps. Declaration and initialization. And in order to create a variable, you have to preede the variable name with the data type of what you plan on storing within that variable. int for a whole integer. But there's other data types, too. Let's create some more variables. What about int age? With variable names, you're not limited to only just x and y. You can really name it whatever you want within some limitations, but make sure that the variable name is descriptive of what it does. So age is going to store an age. Let's say that I am 21 years old. So this is an integer, a whole number. If we need a number containing a decimal portion, that would be a float for floatingoint number. So, one example of a variable that could contain a floatingoint number is a GPA, grade point average. Let's say that my grade point average is a 2.05. So, this is a floating point number. It's a number that contains a decimal portion. We can also store single characters with the char data type like you're pronouncing Charizard. And this will be a letter grade, let's say. Now to store a single character, we have to place it within single quotes when we initialize it with my grade variable. What about a C? Like my average grade is a C. Remember everybody, C's get degrees. So char stores a single character. Now C isn't an object-oriented language. So there is no string data type because strings are technically objects. So if we would like to store like somebody's name, we need a series of characters. So we can create what is called an array. And to create an array, we would follow our variable name with a set of square brackets and then assign this equal to some string of text, some series of characters. Place your series of characters within double quotes and we can store more than one character. So this data type would be technically an array of characters. I'll create a whole separate video on arrays. This is basically how you can emulate a string. It's really just a whole combination of single characters. There's still a lot more data types than just these four. I thought I would cover just some of the more basic data types just because in this video we're going to focus more on variables than data types. I'm planning a separate video just dedicated to data types because there's way more data types than just these four. There's bytes, there's doubles, there's longs, etc. Now, how can we display the value stored within a variable within a print f statement? Here's how we have to use what is referred to as a format specifier. Let's say we have a print f statement and I would like to display my age within a message. So let's create some text. You are age years old. If I would like to display the value contained within my age variable, wherever I would like to insert that value, I will place a format specifier which is represented by a percent sign and then follow this with a secret character that represents the data type of what we're inserting. So if I need to display my age variable, I will use a percent sign as a placeholder followed by D for decimal. and then after my string of text outside of the double quotes add then the name of the variable you would like to insert at this placeholder. So at this location I will insert age and then let's try this. You are 21 years old. So let's try that again with a different variable. Let's say let's go with name. I'll add a second print f statement. print f and then let's say hello. And I would like to insert my name here. So use a percent sign as a placeholder. It's a format specifier. Then to display a character array, that would be s for string. And then add, name. Oh, then we may need to add a new line character to the end of these because I forgot. Let's try that again. Hello, bro. You are 21 years old. Okay, let's display our grade. print f then within quotes your average grade is then to display a character variable that would be percent C for character then outside of our double quotes add the name of the variable we would like to insert at this location so comma grade think I'm just going to space these out a little bit okay then I will add a new line character to the end of Okay. Hello, bro. You are 21 years old. Your average grade is C. Then to display a float, that would be percent F. Print F. Your GPA is percent F. Then I'll add a new line character. So follow this with comma the name of the variable GPA. Okay, your GPA is 2.05. So later on we'll discuss more about format specifiers. There's ways that we can format how our variables are displayed. I just realized that I misspelled average twice. So yeah, those are variables. They are allocated space in memory to store a value. We refer to a variable's name to access the stored value. That variable now behaves as if it was the value that it contains. But to declare a variable, we have to state what type of data that we are storing within that variable. So yeah, those are variables.

8FmE_-QXg3Y,C# getters &amp; setters 🔒,2021-07-03T14:03:54Z,all right we have a lot to talk about today getters and setters but before i explain what these are let me explain the situation we have a class car and we have one field within our car class speed so when we construct a car object we need to pass in something for the speed maybe this is miles per hour kilometers per hour doesn't really matter so let's say that somebody takes our car object and changes the speed to like whatever this number is 100 million actually let's make that a billion how can we prevent people from doing this because currently our car is going way too fast so one way in which we could do that is to change this field from public to private but then we can't access it at all another way is to set up getters and setters and this adds security to our program via this concept called encapsulation so we need to first set up a property for this field the property name is the same as the field name except it's capital so type public if you're returning something list the data type then speed and then let's make this capital then add a set of curly braces a property combines the aspects of both fields and methods and it shares the same name with the field so it's kind of like something in between a field and a method and it contains accessors a get and set accessor now to first assign a value we'll need to change our constructor instead of assigning the field speed we will assign the property speed so this has a capital s let's create a get accessor first when we would like to get the value of speed whatever is contained within speed we will use this get accessor so type get curly braces and we will return speed and then we'll need to assign this with the set accessor then make sure you have that semicolon at the end so by using this get accessor this will read whatever values within our field then we'll need a set accessor if we would like this to be writable set curly braces so what we'll do here is set speed equal to value so value is kind of like a parameter properties combine the aspects of both fields and methods so when we assign a value to speed well then this value is going to be this so it's kind of like an argument and a parameter and within our set accessor we can actually set up like some code or some rules or something so if somebody attempts to change the speed we could write an if statement like if value is greater than let's say 500 then we will limit this let's change speed equal to 500 then else speed equals value now car.speed is inaccessible due to its protection level so we need to access instead of the field the properties so that's speed with a capital s and then if we're going to display the value of speed we'll access the property instead of the field so if we attempt to set our speed equal to 1 billion well we will access this set accessor and then it's going to be limited to 500 then so if we attempt to change our speed to 1 billion it will be limited to 500 and then we can still display the value and access it because by having a getter and setter this is both readable and writable so yeah those are getters and setters they are accessors found within a property a property combines the aspect of both fields and methods and if you have a private field you can also set up a property that has getters and setters for more security so yeah those are getters and setters in c sharp
06BrbJm7Sho,C# abstract classes 👻,2021-07-03T14:04:07Z,all right what's going on abstract classes abstract is a keyword that we can apply to classes properties and methods but in this video we're going to focus on abstract classes now you can apply the abstract keyword it's a modifier to a class and that indicates that this class is missing components or is an incomplete implementation so let's take a look we're using inheritance here so i have a class vehicle vehicle has a speed field as well as a go method and there's three children classes car bicycle and boat and these are complete implementations so car has four wheels and a max speed of 500 bicycle has two wheels a max speed of 50 and boat has zero wheels and a max speed of 100 i just made up some numbers for the max speed i can create a car object bicycle object and boat object just fine these are complete implementations but unfortunately i can also create a vehicle object vehicle vehicle equals new vehicle so vehicle is incomplete it's missing a number of wheels and a max speed so imagine that we're having a race and somebody decides to pick the vehicle but we want somebody to pick a specific implementation of a vehicle like a car bicycle or boat i would like to prevent people from creating generic vehicle objects so this is kind of like imagine somebody picks the invisible vehicle and like a racing game or something one way in which i can prevent people from instantiating vehicle objects because it's not finished it's an incomplete implementation is to precede this class definition with this abstract keyword so if i precede class with abstract i can no longer create a vehicle object cannot create an instance of the abstract type or interface vehicle so that adds a little bit of security to our programs if there's a class that you do not want to be able to instantiate objects from you can just precede that class definition with the abstract keyword and you cannot create an object from that class and that's basically what the abstract modifier does we can indicate that a class we can also apply this to properties and methods as well but that's a video for another day so when we precede a class definition with abstract we are indicating that that class is missing components or is incomplete so we should not be able to instantiate objects from this class which adds a little bit of security so yeah that's the abstract keyword if you found this video helpful help me out by smashing that like button leave a random comment down below and well yeah that's the abstract modifier in c-sharp
EvSyka9vJho,C# inheritance 👪,2021-07-03T14:04:00Z,all right what's going on people inheritance so inheritance is this programming concept of one or more child classes receiving fields methods etc from a common parent kind of like how people inherit genes from their parents well with programming we can kind of do something similar parent classes can have children classes and anything that the parent class has the child classes now have so here's an example let's create a parent class named vehicle not any kind of specific vehicle just a generic vehicle class class vehicle and there will be one field let's say public and speed and i'll set this equal to maybe zero and let's create a method public void go all vehicles can go somewhere and all we'll display is this vehicle is moving we can inherit this speed field and this go method from the vehicle class so this vehicle class is going to have children so let's create a car class a bike class and a boat class so type class car then to inherit from another class type after the class name colon and then the parent in which you would like to inherit from so car is going to be the child class vehicle will be the parent class so car will have access to its own speed and go method and then you can add anything additional within the car class like number of wheels public and wheels and i'll set this to 4 for all car objects now let's create a bicycle class it's the same process as before class bicycle and this will inherit from the vehicle class as well but let's change wheels to two and then let's create a book class class boat and here it's from vehicle wheels zero because well it's a boat okay so let's instantiate a car bicycle and boat object so let's do that here car car equals new car bicycle bicycle keep on spilling bicycle wrong bicycle equals new bicycle and boat boat equals new vote so if we take a look at this car object car dot there is a speed field as well as a go method even though there's nothing within this car class besides wheels so since car is the child class and vehicle is the parent class car has access to a go method and a speed field even though there's nothing within here except a wheels field and of course car objects do have a wheels field as well which we stand within the car class so let's just test these i'm going to display car dot speed car dot speed followed by car dot wheels and i will have this car use its go method car dot go all right so our car speed is zero that's because we set it to be zero within the vehicle class this car has four wheels which we stated within the car class and this car class has a go method that states this vehicle is moving so i bet the same thing applies to our bicycle and boat object so let's copy these three lines of code change car to bicycle bicycle.speed bicycle.wheels and bicycle.go and the same thing applies to both boat.speed boat.wheels boat.go so all three of these different types of vehicles each have a speedfield a wheels field and a go method so the point of inheritance is that we can reuse code i mean we could just copy these fields and methods and then paste them within each of these classes but imagine that you have hundreds of different classes and we need to change like go to start well it's a lot easier just to make that change in one place than having to manually go through all of our classes so yeah that's kind of the benefit of inheritance we can keep anything that these classes have in common within a common parent class and these classes can simply just inherit these fields and methods so yeah that's inheritance if you liked this video be sure to smash that like button drop a random comment down below and well yeah that's inheritance in c sharp
Z70AwnYYJOc,C# auto implemented properties 🔐,2021-07-03T14:04:52Z,all right everybody we have to talk about auto implemented properties this is an intimidating name but don't worry it's actually fairly simple they are shortcuts when no additional logic is required within a property you do not have to define a field for a property and you only have to write get and or set inside the property here's an example i have a class car and what if we would like a model field and property so that might look something like this make sure to not make your field public for this example so this will be a string named model for a model of car and i would like to set up a property that has get and set accessors so that would be public string model with a capital m curly braces and then i need a get and set accessor all we'll do within the get accessor is return model and that's the field and a set will be model our field equals value and within my constructor i will set this dot model property make sure that you have capital m equals model whatever our parameter is so if you're not doing anything else within your getter and setter there's actually a shortcut to all of this and that's by using an auto implement property so this is what we'll do we're going to instead get rid of all this and type public string model with a capital m curly braces get semicolon set semicolon and this will do the same thing however it's a lot less to write so if there's no additional logic that you need besides you know setting the value and getting the current field well you can just use an auto implemented property and this will do the same thing let's test it so let's create a car object car car equals new car then pass in a model of car let's say a porsche this time and then i would like to display the car's model car dot model property with a capital m so there will still be a model field but it's hidden and of this car's model is a porsche so that's like a shortcut you can do an auto implemented property is a shortcut when no additional logic is required in the property you do not have to define a field for a property and you only have to write get and or set inside the property so yeah that is an auto implemented property if you liked this video please give it a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro

WFzLcZk137s,C# nested loops ➿,2021-07-03T14:02:09Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to use nested loops to create a program to draw a rectangle for us made out of a certain symbol that we choose so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right welcome back so nested loops a nested loop is a loop that's inside of another loop there is an outer loop and an inner loop and both of these combined are nested loops so the uses they vary they're used a lot in sorting algorithms so i thought let's create a program where we will draw a rectangle we'll have the outer loop in charge of counting the rows and the inner loop in charge of counting the columns and we will let the user choose a symbol that they would like to create their rectangle of so we'll need to accept some user input so console.writeline let's ask how many rows how many rows actually let's make this a write statement okay and then we will store this within int rows equals then we will need to convert some user input convert 2 and 32 because user input's always a string then within the parenthesis console.read line okay let's ask for columns so let's copy this paste it how many columns int columns then let's ask the user for a symbol to use what symbol or character and let's use a string i guess you can use a char as well string symbol and we do not need to convert this because it's already a string okay we'll have an outer loop in charge of counting the rows and the inner loop is in charge of counting the columns so for then we need our index by the way it doesn't matter if you use a while loop or a for loop it's just the concept of having a loop inside of another loop i just so happen to be using a for loop for the outer loop and a for loop for the inner loop so int i equals zero we will continue this as long as i is less than our rows because we're letting the user choose how many rows then we will increment i by one during each iteration now we need an inner for loop and let's just copy this now one naming convention with the index of the inner for loop since i is already taken what people usually use for an index for the inner loop is j because j comes after i i guess so into j equals zero j is less than columns then j plus plus okay now what we'll do within the inner for loop is display our symbol so console dot right make sure you use right and not right line we will display our symbol so this inner loop is in charge of the columns the outer loop is a charge of rows basically how this is going to work is that once we enter our outer for loop we will immediately enter our inner for loop in order to complete one iteration of the outer for loop we have to finish all iterations of the inner for loop and once we finish all iterations of the inner for loop we can complete one iteration of the outer for loop and during the next iteration we have to do it all over again so on the next iteration we would have to complete all the iterations for the inner for loop so this will display a rectangle made out of a certain symbol however there is one thing missing and i'll show you how many rows let's say four how many columns five and what symbol uh what about the i don't know that sign all right so this ended up in one long row so after we complete our iterations for the inner for loop we should probably move down to the next row kind of like a typewriter we finish one line then we move down to the next row so let's use an empty writeline statement just to move down to the next line so if we try this again okay four rows five columns let's use an at sign there we go there's a rectangle we have one two three four five columns and one two three four four rows so basically a nested loop is really just a loop that's inside of another loop when you'll encounter it it really varies but they're used a lot in sorting algorithms and this was a small program just to practice working with nested loops all right so if you want a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below if you liked this video give it a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and that is an example of nested loops in c sharp
IxBMVztdlr4,C# variables ✖️,2021-07-03T14:00:55Z,hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain variables in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show do you all remember back in middle school when we learned about algebra we had to solve an equation to find the value of x and x as some representation of a number well with programming we can create our own variables but we are not limited to just numbers we can store characters words and even these things called booleans which are either true or false so i'm going to show you all how we can create our own variables in c sharp creating a variable takes two steps declaration and initialization to create a variable we first have to declare what type of data we'll be storing if we need to store a number we'll type int short for integer and we'll need a unique name for this specific variable so let's just call this x and then end the statement with a semicolon because with programming semicolons are kind of like periods when you finish a sentence okay so this step was declaration and i'll just add a note here so this step is declaration and now to assign a value we will initialize this variable so to assign this variable x a value type x equals and then some value let's say one two three then semicolon okay so we now have a variable named x and this step is initialization now you can combine these two steps so to do that we would say int let's say y this time equals 321 semicolon so we have two variables x and y so this step right here is both declaration and initialization now these variables behave as the value that they contain so let's display some of these so within a console console.writeline statement i'm going to display x and then with a second rightline statement i will display y so console.writeline y and we have one two three three two one now you can use these for like math two we could say like int z equals x plus y and then display whatever z is console.writeline z and the result is 444. so these names for these variables really aren't descriptive x y and z we can give some more unique names that describe what kind of value that these variables contain so let's say int edge and i'll assign this variable age a value of 21 and then i can display my edge within a writeline statement or use it for something so let's say console console.writeline and then i can display a message along with my age so let's say your age is so this part is within quotes to display the value of my age i will add plus edge make sure age is not within quotes because then we're printing a string literal and not the value contained within edge so this should display your age is 21. so there's more data types than just int this time let's use a double a double is really just a decimal number it's like a floating point number but with more precision there are floats in c sharp but i don't really think they're that important for beginners so with a double we can store a decimal number and int only stores a whole integer so if i try to display like 21.5 and then display it this is what happens so we'll run into a build error so with int we can only store whole integers but with a double we can store something that includes a decimal so let's say we have a double height and i'll assign this a perfectly average height of 300.5 centimeters i guess and now since this variable is initialized we can use it for something we can change the value or we can use it within a message so let's use console.writeline and i'll display my height within some sort of message let's say your height is space plus height plus another string let's say cm 4 centimeters then let's try it okay your age is 21 your height is 300.5 centimeters so a double variable can store a decimal number unlike with integers they only store whole numbers now the next data type is boolean and to declare a boolean variable we type bool then a variable name so booleans can only store true or false so this might be good if you need something that only has like two options like a light switch it's on or it's off if somebody's online that could be true if they're offline that's false or maybe somebody is alive let's say bull alive either true or false but the last time i checked i am alive so i'm going to say that is true and then we can use this boolean variable for something so let's use this within a console.writeline statement console.writeline and what should we say are you alive plus alive are you alive that is true so if i change this to false this would display are you alive that is false so that is a boolean variable it's only true or false so for practice i'll encourage you to try and type something besides true or false like the word pizza we can't shove a whole pizza into a boolean variable it can only be true or false so let's change that back okay the next data type is char it's a character a single character what about symbol char symbol and we need to place this within single quotes so let's say our character is the at sign and then let's display it console.writeline your symbol is plus symbol your symbol is at sign so make sure that this is within single quotes when you assign a value so with chars we can only assign a single character if i attempted to add like a different symbol too well this wouldn't work then see we're getting an error here so that's where strings come in with a string we can store a series of characters and to declare this we type string with a capital s string let's say name string name and this value is within double quotes so type whatever your first name is and then we can use our name for something let's display a message that says hello whatever your name is console.writeline hello plus name okay hello bro your age is 21 your height is 300.5 centimeters are you alive false your symbol is at sign let's say that we have a username and i'll say string username equals symbol plus name and then i'll display this console.writeline your user name is colon space quotes plus user name whatever you typed here okay your username is at bro those are variables they're containers for values but you can store more than just numbers you can store boolean values characters and strings and a string is a series of characters so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well those are variables in c sharp
b8BUFfgyjK4,C# output 💬,2021-07-03T14:01:01Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all a few different ways in which we can format output in c sharp so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody here's a few different ways in which we can format output in c sharp as we covered in the last video to display something to our console window we would type console.writeline then you need a set of parentheses then a semicolon at the end you place your message within the parenthesis this is known as a method and we have a semicolon at the end the semicolon is kind of like the period at the end of a sentence when we finish a statement in programming we end it with a semicolon so to display a message within double quotes you would type something so this is known as a string literal we're literally printing something to our console so we kind of covered this in the last video this will display the word hello now there's another way in which we can display output that is just right console dot right parentheses semicolon and within quotes let's display something else what about hey now let's take a look at the difference between the two all right we have hey immediately followed by hello all in the same line in the last video we used two right line statements each string literal had their very own line but in this case it's all one line so with writeline after you finish your string literal it's going to hit enter like we're hitting the enter key and we'll move down to a new line right doesn't do that so you have two different ways in which you can display output to the console window right and right line write does not hit the enter key after the end it doesn't create a new line and right line does so you can use either one depending on what you need now there is a shortcut to create a writeline statement you type c then hit tab twice and that will auto generate a right light statement for you okay so the next topic to cover is comments we can add a comment to our code and this will not be displayed as output so to write a comment within your code you need two forward slashes and you can see that the color of our text changed to green so i'm going to tell you this is a comment and this has no effect on our output this comment will not be seen all we see here is hey and hello you can also write a multi-line comment you would type forward slash asterisk this is a multi-line comment then to end a multi-line comment you would end it with asterisk then forward slash again and last but not least we have escape sequences we can add an escape sequence to a string to format our output so let's create a writeline statement and type whatever your name is okay now to create an escape sequence we need to add a backslash followed by a certain character depending on what character you select it's going to have a special effect on your string so if i typed backslash t that will add a tab escape sequence before displaying my name all right so we have a tab before my string so let's change this to maybe a backspace i'll add that here so backslash b that will add a backspace and my name is now br code alright so we can also do new line backslash and for new line so my first name is on one line and my last name is on a second line now you may have noticed that there's all this garbage at the end of my console window when my program is done running so one way in which we can hide that at the end of our program type console.read key so basically this will prevent our program from ending until we type a key and it should be hidden now so if i hit the enter key well then my program is going to finish running all right everybody so those are a few ways in which we can format output in c sharp if you can give this video a thumbs up drop a random comment down below and well those are a few ways to format output in c sharp
u8Xam9EsqXQ,Learn Recursion in 8 minutes 😵,2021-06-21T14:00:11Z,well howdy y'all we're talking about recursion now recursion is when a thing is defined in terms of itself i stole that definition from wikipedia really doesn't make too much sense a thing is defined in terms of itself so basically with recursion we apply the result of a procedure to a procedure a recursive method is one that calls itself and this can be a substitute for iteration there's a lot of overlap where you could use either recursion or iteration with recursion we divide a problem into sub problems of the same type as the original and recursion tends to be used within advanced sorting algorithms and navigating trees some of the benefits of recursive code is that it's easier to read and write and it's easier to debug but the disadvantages is that it's sometimes slower and uses more memory let's begin with a very simple example let's create a method to simulate walking we'll do this both iteratively and recursively then take a look at the differences between the two so let's write an iterative walk method so we will need to invoke this method and then we will pass in the amount of steps that we would like to walk like five steps and then we'll need to declare this method private static void walk and i'll change i to maybe steps just so that it's more descriptive now let's use an iterative approach so iteration is the repetition of an internal process so we can use a for loop that will repeat a process and let's say that int i equals zero we will continue this as long as i is less than steps and then let's increment i by one during each iteration and then during each iteration i will print you take a step and really that's it and after running this code we have walked five steps now let's write the same method recursively recursion is the repetition of a procedure iteration is the repetition of a process so with recursion we need a base case that's what we do when we would like to stop and a recursive case what do we do when we would like to continue so our base case is going to be if steps is less than one then we will return and if you only have one statement within your if statement you don't really need these curly braces so i'm just going to omit those all right then we will print you take a step so this is our base case this is what we do when we would like to stop then our recursive case is what we're going to do when we would like to continue we will invoke the walk method within itself but we will pass in steps minus one and this is our recursive case and this will do the same thing however it's just written a little bit different now one thing that you should know is that programs have a data structure called a call stack a call stack keeps track of the order in which our program needs to function so with the main method we call the main method first and that's added to the bottom of our call stack so in order to complete our program we have to complete the main method and get to the end of it however when we took an iterative approach we invoked the walk method and that was added to the top of our stack remember that video on stacks it's a lifo data structure last in first out we have to take care of anything at the top of our stack first and then work our way down with a recursive approach we're adding multiple frames onto our call stack because one we're calling the main method then we're calling the walk method passing in five is an argument then we're calling the walk method again passing in four as an argument then three then two then one then zero then we return and we have to solve this in a lifo order last in first out we begin at the top and remove frames from the top until we reach the end so that's why using recursion is sometimes slower and uses more memory we're adding more frames to the call stack there's more methods that we have to keep track of now check this out what if we take 1 million recursive steps we're going to call this walk method a million times and that's going to be a problem and we ran into an exception let's take a look at this so we encountered an exception a stack overflow error it's kind of like that one website when working with recursion it is possible to run out of memory although this is sometimes slower and uses more memory recursive code tends to be easier to read and write and easier to debug for a small method like this i would probably stick with an iterative approach just because it already is fairly simple but it's going to really come in handy when we get two topics on advanced sorting algorithms so let's try something a little more complex let's create a program to find the factorial of a number so let's create a factorial method and we'll write this recursively so let's find factorial what about 7 and then we'll need to define this method and we no longer need our walk method so if we're taking a recursive approach finding the factorial of a number let's say that i is num so we'll need a base case if num is less than one we will return one this is our base case then we need a recursive case we will return num times factorial then pass in num minus one and then eventually we'll hit our base case because num is going to be zero and this is our recursive case oh then change void to int because i forgot okay then let's display factorial seven within a print line statement factorial seven and the factorial of seven is five thousand forty so you can see that this was fairly easy to write it only took two lines of code by the way i found a great example of recursion on its wikipedia page and that's by the process of creating refreshed sourdough so the recipe calls for some sourdough leftover from the last time the same recipe was made i thought that was a fairly descriptive example of recursion let's move on to level three let's create a recursive method to find a base raised to a given power let's create a power method and we need a base and an exponent let's find it two to the power of eight and then we'll need to define this method private static let's change void to int i to base and j to exponent we need a base case and a recursive case the base case will be if exponent is less than one we will return one this is our base case our recursive case will be return base times invoke the power method pass in base and exponent minus one and this is our recursive case and then we will need to display the result system.out.printline two to the power of 8 which is 256. all right everybody so that's recursion it's when a thing is defined in terms of itself we apply the result of a procedure to a procedure and a recursive method is one that calls itself and this can be a substitute for iteration we divide a problem into subproblems of the same type as the original and recursion is commonly used within advanced sorting algorithms and navigating trees some of the advantages is that recursive code is easier to read and write and easier to debug however it's sometimes slower and uses more memory so yeah that is recursion if you learn something new be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and well yeah that's recursion in computer science
8mJ-OhcfpYg,Learn Insertion Sort in 7 minutes 🧩,2021-06-08T14:00:42Z,what's going on people it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to discuss the insertion sword algorithm in computer science as always sit back relax and well enjoy the show all right everybody insertion sword now what we do with insertion sort is that we begin at index 1 we take the value found within move it to some temporary storage like a variable named temp to temporarily hold it we examine elements to the left if any elements are larger than what's within temp we shift those elements to the right so 6 is larger than 1 we shift it to the right if it's less than whatever's within temp we stop or until we run out of elements so we have run out of elements we take this value found within temp and place it at this opening here that was the first iteration let's move on to iteration two take this value place it within temp examine the elements to the left if this element is greater than temp then we shift it to the right it's not so we stop here and place this value back where it came from so that was the second iteration iteration three take this value place it within temp examine the elements to the left if they're greater than four we shift them to the right seven is larger than four shift it to the right six is larger than four shift it to the right one is not larger than four so we stop here take whatever's within temp this value four and insert it here into this opening so that was the first three iterations we repeat this process until we run out of elements so i'll speed up the footage so we are currently on index [Music] four [Music] [Music] so [Music] and that is your visual representation of the insertion sword algorithm i like to think of it like a jigsaw puzzle we have some pieces that are connected they fit together and we will move whole sections of pieces together to make room for a piece that fits so let's create our own insertion sword algorithm in java now we'll need to create an array let's create an array of integers int array and make up some numbers put whatever numbers you want within here uh maybe nine how about a one and an eight and a two and a seven three six five four that sounds good to me okay then let's display the elements of this array we'll use a for each loop for and i in array we will display each element within this array with a print statement so let me get rid of that print ln and just have print so i will print i i think i'm going to add a space afterwards i didn't do that in the previous two videos so i think i better do that okay let's just run this just to test it nine one eight two seven three four and before we display the elements of our array let's invoke a function which we still need to declare called insertion sort so insertion sort then we will pass in our array as an argument and we'll need to declare this so i'm going to cheat and create this automatically so outside of our main method create a method named insertion sort private static void insertion sort there is one parameter an array of integers okay now the first thing we'll do is create a for loop to iterate over each element of our array but it begins at one not zero so that would be four then we will set int i to equal one not zero pay attention to that we will continue this as long as i is less than array dot length and we will increment i by one during each iteration now we need to take our value found within i and place it within temp so let's declare a temporary variable named temp int temp equals array at index of i and now we'll create a variable named j int j equals i minus one so this will keep track of what value we're comparing to the left of whatever i is so then we need to create a while loop we will continue comparing values to the left of i and our condition is going to be while j is greater than or equal to zero and array at index of j is greater than temp so if we need to shift an element to the right we would say array at index of j plus 1 equals array at index of j so that will shift an element to the right then we will decrement j by one j minus minus and the last thing to do is to insert the value found within temp into that opening so that would be array at index of j plus one equals temp and that's all there is to it so let's run this oh yeah one two three four five six seven eight nine well people in conclusion the insertion sort algorithm compares elements to the left and it will shift elements to the right to make room to insert a value the insertion sort algorithm has a runtime complexity of big o of n squared it runs in quadratic time it's decent with small data sets but bad with large data sets and using insertion sort tends to be preferable to both bubble sort and selection sort it uses less steps than bubble sort and in the best case scenario insertion sort can run in ofn linear time compared to selection sort which the best case scenario is of n squared all right people so that is the insertion sword algorithm if you can destroy that like button leave a random comment down below and well yeah that's the insertion sword algorithm in computer science
30MKAcoffIo,LinkedLists vs ArrayLists 🤼‍♂️,2021-05-10T14:09:32Z,hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to run some tests on both array lists and linked lists in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's begin we'll need both a linked list and an arraylist so linked list the data type will be integers and i will name this linked list equals new linked list again the data type is integer add a constructor boom we got ourselves a linked list and now we'll need an arraylist change linked to array this will be named arraylist make sure to pay attention the capitalization equals new arraylist and we'll need to keep track of the time we'll need a start time and time and elapsed time and these will be of the long data type we'll be working with nanoseconds so a long is preferable to an end a long is really just a really long integer think of it that way so we have start time end time and elapsed time okay and now we'll need to populate both our linked list and our arraylist and we can do that with a for loop we'll need a large sample size maybe one million elements that'll be good so int i equals zero we'll continue this as long as i is less than a million and i believe that's about a million yeah we're good okay then increment i by one during each iteration so i'm going to add i to both my linked list and my arraylist so we can add primitives because java has an autoboxing feature so even though these are integer objects we can still add primitives and be sure to add to our arraylist as well so arraylist.ad i okay let's move on now we'll keep track of the time we'll need to assign the start time of value and end time of value before and after our operation so let's say that start time equals and we can get the current time of our jvm by using system dot nano time method and let's take a look so this returns the current value of the running java virtual machines time source in nanoseconds so we will get the start time after we do something i'll just add a note here do something then we will get the end time so end time equals system dot nano time method and to calculate the elapsed time that will be elapsed time equals end time minus start time and then we'll probably want to display this so let's do that system.out.printline and let's say linked list i'll add a tab too plus elapsed time plus ns4 nanoseconds and let's just run this to test it so this portion of code really took right between here took 400 nanoseconds okay let's actually do something now so let's get the first element within our linked list linked list dot get zero and let's see how long this takes okay 13 200 nanoseconds now with an arraylist let's copy everything that we have for our linked list and change linked list to arraylist and be sure to do that here as well array list and let's compare these so we are getting the index of zero for both our linked list and arraylist and we will compare them and it appears that our arraylist is slightly faster our linked list took 11 800 nanoseconds and our arraylist took 6700 so it looks like getting the first element of our linked list is going to be a little bit slower than our arraylist this time let's get something right in the middle of our linked list and arraylist so i'm going to turn this line to a comment and we will get the index of 500 000 so that's right in the middle and do the same thing with arraylist as well so arraylist dot get 500 000. and let's see how long this takes okay so our linked list took way longer than our array list our linked list took 7.5 million nanoseconds compared to our arraylists 6900 nanoseconds okay so that's still way longer with a linked list now let's try something near the end of our linked list and array list what about the last element linked list die get 999 999 so that is the last index in our linked list and array list we have one million elements and this is exclusive and the first element has an index of zero so let's do the same thing with arraylist die get 999 99999 and here are the results our linked list took 63 000 nanoseconds compared to our arraylist 17 000. now the reason that our linked list took less time to retrieve and index at the end is because this linked list is a doubly linked list so we can begin at the head and work our way towards the tail or begin at the tail and work our way backwards to the hud so since this index is right at the end it's actually going to be very easy to retrieve this index whereas in the middle is actually going to be the worst possible spot for a linked list because we can start at either end but it's still going to take the same amount of time to get to the middle so it appears that accessing an element from an arraylist is always faster than a linked list and that's to be expected because with an arraylist we have a random access of elements unlike with a linked list we have to begin at one end of our linked list and traverse our linked list until we get to the index that we're looking for now let's add or remove an element from our linked list and array list maybe just remove because it's going to take really the same amount of time so linked list dot remove and let's remove the first element so index zero and do the same thing with arraylist array list dot remove index zero and let's take a look again okay so it appears that our linked list was actually faster this time 17 000 nanoseconds compared to 2.2 million nanoseconds of an arraylist and the reason that our arraylist took longer is because we need to shift all elements to the left after removing an element so we had to shift one million elements after removing the first element now let's remove something near the middle so let's remove index number five hundred thousand so linked list dot remove five hundred thousand and do the same thing with the arraylist be sure to comment this line out arraylist dot remove 500 000. and here are the results so it looks like our linked list took a lot longer this time 7 million nanoseconds compared to 1.6 million nanoseconds for an arraylist so with our arraylist there were less elements to shift this time because we were right in the middle but with our linked list we still had to navigate to the middle to remove one of these elements and then let's remove the element at the end of both our linked list and our array list linked list that remove 999 999 and do the same thing with arraylist arraylist.remove 999 999. and this time our linked list is just slightly slower than our arraylist adding or removing elements near the end of an array list is actually fairly easy the closer that we insert or delete near the end the less time it's going to take because we have to shift less elements and with a linked list well this is a doubly linked list so accessing the last element doesn't really take too long if it's near the middle it's going to take forever actually so it seems that in most situations an arraylist is going to be better than a linked list however if you have to do a lot of inserting or deleting especially if it's a large data set a linked list might be better but it seems that an array list is going to be more flexible for most applications so that is linked lists versus array lists if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's linked lists versus arraylists and computer science
tCVo7NzCO4k,JavaFX FlowPane 🌊,2021-03-18T14:00:32Z,
CNLHTrY3Nh8,JavaFX TreeView 🌳,2021-03-17T14:00:04Z,yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate the tree view control in java fx so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay tree views a tree view is a control that displays hierarchical data in a tree-like structure so this control is found underneath the controls drop down menu just drag and drop it place it anywhere and i'm going to give this tree view a unique id let's call it tree view now when we select tree items from our tree view we still need to populate our tree view but we would like to invoke a method whenever we select an item so underneath the code drop down menu go all the way down to on context menu requested and we can call a method when we select an item so we'll need to place a method name here and here on mouse clicked now that will take care of setting up our tree view control however we still need to populate our tree view with data and this data is known as tree items and these tree items will be arranged in a hierarchical structure so let's save and then head to our controller class as always refresh your fxml document and we need to declare a select item method so let's do so within our controller class public void select item okay and let's run it currently we just have an empty tree view with no data within it so we need to populate our tree view with data and possibly one of the best places to write that code would be within our initialize method but we need to implement the initializable interface so controller implements initializable interface and be sure to add any unimplemented methods and i'm just going to move this to the top because i like it at the top okay let's use some fxml injection to inject our tree view private tree view tree view at this point we need to create tree items to add to our tree view let's begin with a root item so let's declare a tree item and we're going to list a generic data type of strings if you're working with files you'll probably list files here but let's just work with strings because they're easy so let's call this tree item root item equals new tree item and we are going to pass in the text of this tree item let's say files like it's some sort of big directory of some sort okay then we need to add this root item this tree item to our tree view and let's take care of that near the bottom so at the bottom we'll type tree view dot set root and pass in a tree item we will pass in our root item now when we run this we should have our tree item within our tree of view of files now here's the plan we're going to create more tree items and add these tree items as children to our root item maybe think of these like branches if files is the root we'll have a root branches and then leaves so let's create more tree items i'm just going to copy this to save some time and paste it let's create a branch item i'll call this branch item one and what type of file should we have let's say we're working with pictures let's create maybe two more branches so branch item one two and three these will be kind of like different folders so we have a folder for pictures how about videos and music now we need to add all of these branches to our root item and here's how type the name of your root item dot get children followed by dot add or add all and we will pass in branch item one two and three now after running this within our files tree item we have pictures videos and music but why stop there these children can have their own children so let's create more tree items so let's copy all these and paste them let's call these leaf item then give them a number so one through six would be good okay so within pictures let's say we have picture one and picture two within videos we could have video one and video two and within music music one music two now we need to add these leaf items to each branch item so it's kind of the same process as before really okay we have branch item one two and three okay within branch item one let's add leaf item one and two and we can get rid of that okay within branch item two we'll have leaf item three and four then within branch item three leaf item 5 and 6. and that should be good for this example so we're adding a bunch of leaves to our branches and adding the branches to our root it kind of resembles a tree that analogy so let's try it so we have files then pictures videos and music now when i select one of these tree items we will invoke this select item method but we need to get the current value of the tree item that we select here's how we'll declare a tree item to store the current tree item that we select so type tree item list your generic type that you're working with we're just working with strings for this example let's call this item equals tree view dot get selection model followed by dot get selected item so whatever item that you select we will store within item and let's display the value system.out.printline item dot get value method now there's one issue that we're going to run into now here's the problem if i was to navigate through my tree view by clicking these arrows we will encounter a null pointer exception however if i was to click on these tree items this will work as intended we will get the current value of each tree item that we select now the reason that we ran into a null pointer exception is because when we select these arrows we are still invoking the select item method after invoking the select item method if there's no item to get we will store null with an item then by calling the get value method of item this will cause a null pointer exception so let's check to see if item does not equal null with an if statement before calling the get value method so let's write an if statement if item does not equal no then we will call the get value method of item and let's try it again now if i was to navigate through this tree view we do not run into that null pointer exception and we can select each tree item from our tree view and get the current value stored within you can also add icons to each of these tree items i'll just show you one for files but you can copy the process for the rest so within my source folder i have this png file named folder icon and it's about 25 by 25 pixels so you'll need something small now when you construct a tree item you can also pass in an argument for a new image view so after we create files let's pass in a new image view and then within the constructor of our new image view i will pass in a new image and list the file name or the file path this is folder icon dot png next to this tree item i have the intended image that i would like to use so to add an image to a tree item when you construct your tree item you can pass in a new image view then an image then the file name or the file path here's one last trick for you all so to initially hide this root item and display each of these children we can use the set show root method of tree view so type treeview dot set show root and we can pass in false now when we display this tree view the root item is hidden and all of its children are instead displayed so that's another option available to you too well everybody that is the tree view control it is a control that displays hierarchical data in a tree-like structure if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this to the comment section down below but yeah that is the treeview control in javafx
XKHEtdqhLK8,Python Full Course for free 🐍,2021-02-15T15:00:12Z,hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to help you get started with python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm i'm gonna tell you why you need to learn python it's the easiest programming language to learn as well as being the most popular in the world right now and according to glassdoor the salary for new python developers in the united states is 64 000 if any of this sounds good to you well then let's get started if you need to download python go to python.org downloads and click this yellow download python button open when done check add python 3.9 or another version to path install now and then give it a little bit it states here that setup was successful so let's close out of this our next step is to download an ide that's an acronym for integrated development environment think of it as software that helps us write other software one ide that i recommend is pycharm you can find it at jetbrains.com pycharm go to download if you would like to pay for a professional version you can click this download button but since i don't like to pay for things i'm going to use the free community version at this point we just have to follow the standard installation procedure click next you can pick a destination folder but i'll keep the default next if you would like a desktop shortcut then check this i would also recommend updating the path variable next install and then give it a minute or two then after finishing i have a desktop shortcut so i can just click on this to run pycharm let's create a new project name this project whatever you like i'm going to name this project hello world and i recommend not creating a main dot pi welcome script right now i'll show you how to do that manually and let's create if you need a python file to work with this is how to create one go to file new python file and i'm going to name this main and then click python file all right ladies and gentlemen we now have an empty python script that we can use to begin coding now if you checked this box create a main.pi welcome script and then created a new project then your main python file will probably look a little something like this but that's completely fine we can just delete this i don't know about you guys but the font is very small for me so let's change that we can change that by going to file settings editor font and you can increase the font size let's say 25 you can also change the font too what's a good one uh how about that then click apply and okay much better we can actually see something to run a python script just click the screen play button in the corner alternatively you can go to the run tab and then go to run okay so this box that appeared at the bottom this is referred to as a terminal window this will display any output that your program has and this line at the end process finished with exit code zero that just means that there were no errors in this program so currently this program doesn't do anything but let's change that let's print something let's print a message so to print a message to the terminal window type print and then add a set of parentheses and then you can type a message but it has to be within quotes either double quotes or single quotes it doesn't matter so let's think of a message i don't know i love pizza then let me run this and in my terminal window it says i love pizza to print another line just add another print statement print and then your message within quotes it's really good and well what do you know it printed i love pizza it's really good so ladies and gentlemen you just wrote your first python program by the way you can change the font as well as the font color of your terminal window by going to file settings then go to editor color scheme console font and console colors let's change the font let's say i would like whatever this font is then click apply let's change the font color too by going to console colors for any output you can click number two and select a color let's say i would like bright green that should be decent and for anything else let's say this will be a dark color so i can barely see it so then let's click apply and okay oh yeah that's much better well everybody that was your very first python program i'll post any useful links and timestamps for this video in the comments section down below but yeah welcome to coding with python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how variables work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right let's do this a variable is a container for a value it behaves as the value that it contains it's much like in algebra lessons back in the day where we had to solve for whatever value x was and then we can reuse x and it behaved exactly as that value well with programming we can do that plus we can assign variables of different data types so they are not limited to just numbers we can assign whole words numbers and even these things called booleans which are either true or false but i'll get more in depth into data types a little bit later on in this video so let's create a variable and this is how to do so we need a unique name for this variable let's say name name equals some value now the first data type that we'll cover is strings a string is a series of characters so to create a string we can either use single quotes or double quotes in python and we can assign this a value of whatever your own name is so i will assign this variable name a value of bro now this variable will behave exactly as if it was this value this name and then we can reuse this variable for something so let's print whatever our name is print name and this will print whatever your name is to the console window now when you print your variable make sure you don't put it within quotes because what we're doing then is literally printing the word name as you can see here so if you need to use your variable for something make sure it's not within quotes now we can combine our string variable with another string so within our print statement let's print a string literal such as hello space plus name so we are combining strings and then we're printing the results to the console window so this will print hello bro now you can actually check the data type of a variable so i'm going to turn this line into a comment so what you'll do is take the name of the variable surround this with a set of parentheses and then precede the set of parentheses with the type function and this will print the data type of this variable to the console window and you can see that it says class str short for string a string is a series of characters a name is a good example of a string a series of characters so that is how to check the data type of a variable just use the type function now you can actually combine variables together as long as they're of the same data type so let's change our name to maybe first name and we'll create a second variable called lastname now a common naming convention with variables if it has two words separate each word with an underscore it's not necessary but it's common practice for python and honestly i sometimes forget about that but don't tell anybody so let's create another variable called last name last name equals whatever your last name is and then let's create a third variable called full name full underscore name and let's combine first name plus last name and let us display full name along with hello plus full name now these two names were combined together to create a whole new variable actually what i think i'll do is add a space within my variable so i'm doing a bunch of string concatenation i'm combining the variable first name plus a space character plus last name so the result is hello whatever your first name and last name is so that is a variable of the string data type it is a series of characters now with strings we cannot normally use these for any sort of math that's where the next data type comes in for the time being i just turned all of these lines into comments and we are going to move on to the int data type short for integer this time let's create a variable called age and we will assign this a value of whatever your age is let's just say that i'm 21 now when you assign a value of the int data type make sure that it is not within quotes because then technically it would be a string then and you can see that the color scheme for this number actually changed so if this was a string we would treat it different than an int data type because with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math so we now have a variable called edge and we can actually increase or decrease or do whatever we want with the edge let's increase our age by one let's say it's our birthday to do so we would say age equals age plus one and then let's print our edge to the console window print edge and you can see that it says i am 22. now there's a shorthand way of writing this what you'll do is type age plus equals one so that's kind of like a shortcut and this would work the same too now let's print the data type of our inch variable because we can within a print statement i will print the edge and add my edge variable to this type function and this will print the data type of my edge variable to the console window and i will turn this line into a comment just so that it doesn't get in the way now if i were to print the data type of my age variable as you can see it is of the int data type short for integer it only stores a whole integer number now what if this was a string so what i'm going to do is surround my value within a set of quotes and i will turn this line into a comment so that it does not get in the way you can see that the data type of my age variable is now a string and with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math so let's attempt to increase our age variable by one and we ran into an error a type air can only concatenate string to string not end now the point being is that it's important to use the appropriate data type because with strings we cannot normally use them for any sort of math you'll want to use a data type of a numeric value an int or a float which we'll discuss a little bit later now here's a situation to consider what if we would like to display our edge variable along with a string literal much like what we did with this line involving a string literal such as hello plus the user's full name so let's attempt to do so and this is not going to work and i'll explain why so within our print statement let's say something such as your age is plus edge now we're going to run into a type error that's because we attempted to use string concatenation with a string literal and a variable of a different data type a variable of the int data type in order to display our edge along with the string we would need to convert our edge variable to the string data type and one way in which we can do that is by type casting and we'll cover this more in the next video so we're going to surround our age variable that is of the in data type with a set of parentheses and precede this with str short for string and this will convert our variable to a string that will allow us to display it with another string now if we were to run this program this way this will now display your age is and in this case 22 so if you need to display a variable of a different data type along with the string you would just need to use a stringcast to convert that data type to a string but we'll cover this more in the next video on typecasting so that is the int data type it stores a whole integer number and the next data type is the float data type and i'm going to turn these lines into comments and we can move on now the float data type is a numeric value that can store a number that includes a decimal portion an int data type cannot store a decimal portion that's why it's in short for integer it only stores a whole number this time let's say we have a height and i will assign this a perfectly normal height of maybe 250.5 centimeters so this decimal portion is important that's indicating that this is a floating point number a float for short so let's print our height to the console window print height and this will print whatever my height is and now let's check the type of our height using the type function so within a print statement i'm going to add my height surround this with another set of parentheses and precede this with the type function and the data type of my variable height is a float short for a floating point number a numeric value that contains a decimal portion and now for practice let's print our height along with a string literal so let's create a string literal such as your height is plus height but guess what we're going to do some type casting so surround height with a set of parentheses and precede this with str so that we convert height to a string so that we can use string concatenation within this print statement and this will print the message your height is 250.5 actually let's add centimeters to the end so plus cm and there we go and that is what a floating point number is float for short it is a numeric value that contains a decimal portion now the last data type that we're going to cover is the boolean data type it is a variable that can only store true or false let's say we have a variable called human if we were to assign this a boolean value this would be either true or false and we can print whatever this value is let's print whatever human is and this will display false now the reason that you may want to use booleans instead of strings even though you can still store a string representation of the word false or true is that these are very useful when we get to if statements we can check to see if some statement is true so that is a good use of boolean values now let's check the data type of my human variable so let's print type human and this will print to the console window bool short for boolean now make sure you're not putting this within quotes because then it's technically a string and they behave differently now the data type is a string and you may have noticed as well that the font color has changed between strings and boolean values so that's another good indicator now what if you need to display your value along with a string using string concatenation well guess what we're going to typecast again so let's print something r u a human so we need to use string concatenation so i will convert my boolean variable of human to a string and i have been programmed to inform you that yes i am in fact a human that is true well everyone that is the basics of variables it is a container for a value and they behave as the value that they contain there are four basic data types strings which store a series of characters inc which store a whole integer floats which are floating point numbers a numeric value with a decimal and booleans which only store true or false and they're very useful with if statements so that is it for variables if you would like a copy of all this code i will copy and paste all of this to the comments section down below but yeah that is how variables work in python hey people what's going on it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain multiple assignment in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show well then since you clicked on this video i should probably explain what multiple assignment is now multiple assignment allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time using one line of code here's an example of us using standard assignment let's say we have a variable name and i will set this to a value of my name but you can use your name for this example let's say edge equals 21 and how about a variable called attractive i think i'm going to set this to true okay so we have a bunch of variables and then we can print the value of these variables with some print statements so let's print name age and attractive so we have name age attractive and as you would expect this prints bro 21 and true now another way in which we could write the same code is to use multiple assignment and this allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time using one line of code so i'm going to turn all of these lines into comments and this time we will only use one line of code but to do this we're going to list all of our variables separated with a comma so that would be name comma edge comma attractive and we will set them equal to those values but in the same order separated by commas so that would be bro comma 21 comma true and this would do the same thing only using one line of code here's another example let's say we have four variables spongebob patrick sandy and squidward and let's pretend that they're all around maybe 30 years old at least it seems like they're around 30 years old but i could be wrong i'm not too familiar with spongebob lore so let's set them all equal to 30. now we could write this using four lines of code or we could use multiple assignment to write the same thing using one line of code so if all of these variables are all equal to the same value there's a little bit of different syntax here so let's begin with the first variable of spongebob equals patrick equals sandy equals squidward then we're going to set them all equal to 30 and this should work just fine using only one line of code well everybody that's pretty much it for multiple assignment it allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time using one line of code i will post all of this code in the comments section down below and well yeah that's how multiple assignment works in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate some useful string methods in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's do this in this video i'm going to be explaining and demonstrating a few useful methods available to us for strings now let's create a variable called name for this example and you can use your own name if you want so we now have a variable called name and for my first example let's print the length of our name variable so to do that we can surround our name variable with the length method and this will print and return how long the length of our string is and for me the length of my name variable is three for three characters if i were to increase the size of my name well then that's going to change to a so that is the length method and i'm just going to turn this line into a comment and let's move on so next we have the find method i just copy and pasted print name so i can reuse it name dot and actually if you have intellisense setup if you add dot after your variable you'll get a suggestion or a few suggestions of different methods and other features that you have access to so let's find find which is uh screw this i'll just type find find then we can find the first index of where this character is let's say i would like to find where capital b is well that is at index zero because computers always start with zero so this first character would be zero then r would be one and then o would be two for this example all right so that is how to find a character within a string moving on so let's capitalize our name and i should probably make this lowercase so name dot capitalize and this will make my name capitalized but if there's any spaces and then additional words it's not going to capitalize that only the first letter and your string next we have upper this will make your string all uppercase name upper and now it is uppercase guess what's next lower name dot lower and i should probably make this capital again and everything is lowercase we're making some good progress today next we have is digit this will return true or false depending on if our string is a digit which it's not so this will print false if i changed my string to a bunch of numbers like 1 2 3 then this will return true let's change that back and move on next we have is alpha are these alphabetical characters oh make sure you add the parentheses afterwards my bad false because we added a space within here now it's true so you can use is alpha to check to see if your string contains only letters alphabetical letters next we have count we can count how many characters are within our string i would like to count how many o's are in here and this should return two that's right okay we're almost at the end we can replace characters within our string so we use the replace method and we pass in two arguments the character we would like to replace and the character we would like to replace our character with i would like to change all o's to a's and now my name is brock hod oh you guys are gonna like this next one this isn't technically a method but it's a really neat feature so one thing that we can do that's available to us with python is that we can display a string multiple times by multiplying that string by a given number so let's say i would like to display my name three times i can just take my string variable then add times three and this will print my name three times bro bro bro like i said not technically a method but it's a useful feature that you might be interested in that's related all right everybody so that is a few useful methods available to us for strings if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah those are a few useful methods available to us for strings hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about typecasting in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right welcome back everybody i have a super quick video for you guys today on the subject of typecasting now typecasting is the ability to convert the data type of a value to another data type here's an example that i've written already i'm just going to paste it i have three variables for this example x y and z x contains one this is a whole integer into for short y contains two point zero this is a floating point number float four short you can tell it's a float because it ends with a decimal portion and z contains a string of three a string is a series of characters and you can tell it's a string because it's surrounded with a set of quotes and remember with strings we cannot normally perform math on strings so i have three print statements for x y and z and as you would expect they contain the values of one two point zero and three now let's begin by converting both y and z to the integer data type via typecasting in order to perform typecasting on a value or variable type that value or variable and surround this with a set of parentheses whoops i missed and then pre-save this with the data type you'd like to convert this value or variable to i would like to convert y to an integer and then you can use this for whatever you need so i'm going to replace y within my print statement with y after we typecast it as an integer and this will display 1 2 not 2.0 it's the whole integer of 2 and then 3. so this is not a permanent change if you need to make this as a permanent change to y you'd have to reassign it so let's say y equals y and then we're going to typecast y so let's round this with a set of parentheses and precede this with the data type we'd like to convert y2 so now y is a whole integer and then we will print y without typecast this time and our result is one two three now z z is storing a string and with strings we cannot normally perform any math on strings for example within my print statement i will state z times three you would think that the result would be nine right well you're wrong it's going to print three three times if you need to convert a string to a int or a float you would just have to typecast it so this time let's type cast z as an integer z int and we will type cast z as an integer so then if we have z times three the result is now 9 instead of 333 so that's the basic formula for type casting now let's convert these to floating point numbers but let's include x as well because x is feeling left out so let's convert x to a floating point number so float parenthesis and we will surround this with x and display x and actually let's convert y and z to floats as well because why not the results are now 1.0 2.0 and 9.0 remember that we multiplied z times three and then if we need to convert these values to a string we would use the string cast so the results now are 1 2.0 and 333 now you might be thinking to yourself when would you need to convert an integer or a float to a string here's a situation let's say within our print statements we need to print these variables along with another string so within our print statement let's say x is plus x we would like to display these together and let me copy this and do the same thing for y we'll say y is plus y you cannot normally display a string along with an integer or a float because we're using some string concatenation so this will result in a compilation error can only concatenate string not int to string so that's a situation in which you might need to use typecasting to convert an integer or float to a string so let's display x and y as strings via typecasting so we'll surround x and y with a set of parentheses and precede this with the data type we'd like to convert these values to we would like to convert x and y to both strings and now this will compile and run just fine well everybody that's the basics of typecasting if you would like a copy of all my code i will post everything in the comments down below if you found this video helpful don't be afraid to help me out by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can accept some user input in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show ladies and gentlemen this is where the fun begins in this video i'm going to explain how we can accept some user input in python and we do so by using the input function and then we type in our input to the console window but it would probably be good practice to let the user know what we want them to type in exactly so let's ask for somebody's name within quotes inside the input function i'm going to type what is your name and now our program will wait for us to enter in some user input so you can use your own name for this example i'm going to type bro now to submit some user input you just type or press enter now you can see that my process finished with exit code zero that means the program is done running so we should probably do something with this value we can actually assign it to a variable so we can use it elsewhere in our program so to do so we precede input with a variable like name works name equals input and when we accept some user input we will assign it to this variable that we called them and now we can do something with it so let's print a message involving our name variable that we have so how about hello plus name now when i run this program we can accept some user input and then do something with that input such as display message that says hello bro and then you can type in whatever you want for your name let's say i'm dude what is your name dude hello dude now this next part is very important when we accept user input it is always of the string data type a series of characters what if we need to accept a number well you can but you can't normally perform any math on it because it's of the string data type we would need to cast it as either of the integer data type or of the float data type so here's an example of why we can't perform any math on a string let's say we have a variable called edge age equals input and let's ask how old somebody is how old are you now i will add one to somebody's age let's pretend it's their birthday age equals age plus one this will add one to their age now let's try and run this what is your name bro how old are you let's say that i'm 21. okay we ran into an error a type error can only concatenate string to string with what i mentioned previously we cannot normally use strings for any sort of mathematical equation or operation we'll want to cast it to the integer or the float data type so let's cast our user input to the integer data type and we will surround our user input with a cast surround your input with a set of parenthesis and precede this with int and now we can use this user input in a mathematical operation so let's try it even though this won't display age yet so what is your name bro 21 and our program finished with an x a code of zero there were no problems now let's attempt to display this edge so i will print u r plus age plus years old we're doing some string concatenation here what is your name bro how old are you 21 all right we ran into a type error again can only concatenate string to string you cannot normally display a variable of the integer data type along with strings because we're doing string concatenation we're adding strings together we would need to convert this variable back to the string data type so we can cast it we'll surround our edge variable with a cast now this is what's going to happen we will accept some user input it will be of the string data type and then we will immediately cast it to be of the integer data type so that we can treat it as a number instead of a character and then if we need to display this edge we will need to convert it back to a string so that we can use some string concatenation and display all of these strings together and now let's try this theory so what is your name bro how old are you let's say i'm 21 hello bro you are 22 years old here's a situation what if we enter a number that contains a decimal portion so let's try this again let's say i'm 21.5 years old well now we ran into a different issue a value error invalid literal for int with base 10 that means if we cast a string as an integer it can only be a whole number a portion that does not contain a decimal and that is where the float data type would come in it is a data type that can contain a decimal portion for this example let's create a third variable called height and we will ask for somebody's height input we'll create a prompt that says how tall are you and we will cast this to be of the float data type so that our string our user input can contain a decimal portion and then we can treat it as a number instead of a series of characters and i think i will delete this line we won't really need it anymore and then let's print their height along with a message u r plus then height but we need to cast this back to being a string so we'll surround our height with a cast plus let's say cm tall all right let's test this what is your name bro how old are you let's say i'm 21 how tall are you let's pretend that i'm 250.5 centimeters tall i'm adding the 0.5 just to test to see if this will accept a floating point number hello bro you are 21 years old you are 250.5 centimeters tall not really all right everybody so that is the basics of user input in python normally with user input it will give you a value of the string data type if you need to use that value for any sort of math you'll probably need to cast it to be of the integer or the float data type so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's how to accept user input in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to demonstrate a few useful functions related to numbers in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay let's begin in this video i'm going to be demonstrating a bunch of useful functions related to numbers and a bunch of these functions are located within the math module now let's create a variable for this example let's say pi equals 3.14 just the first few digits of pi is fine for this example and now here's a bunch of useful functions that you guys would probably be interested in the first is round round is a built-in function and all we do is type round then add a set of parenthesis and then we can pass in a value or a variable as an argument and the round function will round that number for us so pi rounded to the nearest whole integer is you guessed it three now we can round a number up by using the seal function of the math class seal short for ceiling so let's print our result and in order to access this function within the math module we would type the name of the module dot and here's a bunch of functions that we have access to so we are looking for seal and it's actually at the top here for me and at seal we'll round a number up to the nearest whole integer so pi rounded up is four then on the flip side we can round a number down by using floor and that is also located within the math module so let's type math dot floor and pi rounded down would be three up next i have the absolute value function but it's abs for short abs will give you the absolute value of a number so the absolute value of pi actually let's make this negative 3.14 the absolute value will tell you how far a number is away from zero so if you pass in a negative number it will give you a positive number so that is abs short for absolute value next we have the pow function pow will raise a base number to a power let's raise pi to the power of two so we pass in two arguments a base and an exponent pi to the power of two is nine point eight and some change so that is the pow function next we have square root so this is located within the math module we'll type math dot s q r t short for square root and the square root of pi is let's find out oh i guess we can't pass in pi uh let's round a different number like 420 oh i guess that's because i made pi negative okay so the square root of 420 is 20.4 and some change so that is the square root function all right we have two left we have the max function the max function will find the largest of a varying amount of values so let's create three variables for this example let's say x equals one y equals two and z equals three we can use the max function to find the largest of these values so within a print statement let's use the max function and pass in all of the different values or variables that you would like to compare so i would like to find the largest value between x y and z and the result in this example is three now the min function will find the lowest so min and then pass in your values or variables so i would like to find the minimum value between x y and z and in this case it is one well everybody those are a few useful functions that you guys might be interested in if you guys would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah those are a few useful functions related to numbers in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain string slicing in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right then let's talk about slicing slicing can be used to create a substring by extracting elements from another string the same principle can also be applied to different collections as well but in this video we're going to be focusing on slicing strings now to slice a string we can either use the indexing operator which is a set of square brackets or by use of the slice function to create a slice object this is a little more complex we'll discuss the slice function near the end of this video so with slicing there are three optional arguments three fields that we can fill in depending on where and how we want to slice our string a starting index a stopping index and a step let's begin with the starting index now for this example let's say we have a string variable called name and this will store a value of whatever your own full name is yes i legally change my name to bro code you can use your own name for this if you want so what i would like to do is to create a substring based off a sliced portion of my full name so what i would like to do is create a substring based off of just the first part of my name just bro so let's begin by creating a substring maybe i'll call this first name equals now to slice a string type in a string or the name of a variable that contains your string and follow this with the indexing operator and like i said we'll discuss the slice function a little bit later so we need a starting index and a stopping index but we'll begin with the starting index where do we want to begin our slice so computers they always start with zero so the first character in your string will have an index of zero i would like my slice to begin at index 0 so i'll list that for the starting position the starting index so let's test this just to be sure it works i'll just print first name and let's see if this prints capital b which it does so following that same pattern the next character within my string would have an index of one that would be r then the next index two would be o and three should be an empty space all right so that is the starting index within string slicing if we would like to slice an entire portion of our string not just one letter we need a stopping index as well and both of these fields are separated with a colon so let's say i would like to slice the first three characters of my string so this would have an index of zero one two and this isn't going to work as you would imagine and i'll explain why so you would think that indexes 0 through 2 would give us three letters right but it only gives us two so this first index is inclusive the stopping index is exclusive so if i want the first three characters the first three letters in the string i would need the starting index to be zero and the stopping index to be three and now this should print my first name and not anything else there is a shorthand way of writing this too so if you were to leave this first index blank for start well python is going to assume that this is zero the beginning of your string so this would be no different than what we had previously just having colon three now let's try and create a separate substring for a last name so last name name now we need a starting index and a stopping index so we need the starting index at least so this would be zero one two three four four colon and where do we want this to stop zero one two three four five six seven and remember that this is exclusive so we're going to place eight here and now i would like to display last name and this should just display code and a shortcut is that if you were to leave stop blank but you still have that colon this is a shorthand way of writing i would like every character starting at index four and everything after until the end so there would be no change to this as well you can write it either way okay so we still have to discuss step step is an optional field that we can set a value to so step is how much we're increasing our index by between starting and stopping so it is entirely possible to create a substring that will count only every second character after the first normally step is one by default but if we were to set that to two we're going to count only every second character so let's try this maybe i'll create a new variable called funky name because i really don't know what else to call this for this example let's say funky name equals name and i'm going to count only every second character including the first so the indexes would be zero colon eight for my example but if you're using your own name that's probably going to be something different so the default first step is one and if i were to display funky name as it is currently this will just display my full name but if we set step to two this will only display every second character including the first so funky name is now for me at least b o c d now if step was three this will print only every third character including the first where it's b space d a shorthand way of writing this is that you could leave start and stop empty but the important thing is to have these two colons python is going to assume that if you leave your starting index empty you're referring to index 0 the beginning if your second index your stopping index is empty python will assume this will be the very end of your string so just having two colons and then step three would be no different than what we had previously or this next part i'm going to explain how we can reverse a string in python so let's create a new substring variable called reversed name equals name i would like to use the entire string so i can just use two colons python will fill in the rest so for the step this is going to be negative one it's kind of like we're counting backwards and we're going to create a new sub string based off my name but in reverse so if i were to print my reversed name this is now edok orb i think that's how you pronounce it so that's how to reverse a string in python using slicing now let's move on to part two of this video i'm going to be explaining the slice function and we can use the slice function to create a slice object which is actually reusable so that's somewhat convenient let's take a different scenario this time let's say we have a website url website equals http colon2forwardslashes google.com but use whatever website you want what i would like to do for this program is remove and create a substring based off the website name and not anything else i would like to exclude the http portion as well as the dot-com portion of this website url so let's break it down step by step our first step is to create a slice object so i will name the slice object as slice slice equals and i will invoke the slice function so within the parentheses of the slice function we can add up to three values a start a stop and a step exactly the same as what we did with indexing however with the slice function we separate each of these values with a comma instead of a colon but it works the same way so we would like our substring to begin where the name of the website begins so we would like our start to be zero one two three four five six seven so i will pass in seven for where my substring will begin and now each value within the slice function will be separated with a comma instead of a colon like what we did with the indexing operator now for the stop index that's going to be a little bit tricky and let me explain why one issue that we're going to run into is that not all website names are consistent with their length they can really vary so it is not possible for us to use the same stopping index for each of these website urls so one way in which we can account for that is to use what is called a negative index each character within a string has a positive index as well as a negative index and a negative index works almost exactly the same way except the character most on the right begins with a negative index of minus one and the character on the left of that would be negative two negative three and negative four it's as if you're counting backwards so with indexing we can use some combination of positive and negative indexing so i would like my substring to end where this dot is so this would have a index of minus one minus two minus three minus four and remember that this is exclusive so i would like my slice to begin at index seven and a negative index of four for the stopping position so that will give me just the website name and remove the http portion as well as the dot com portion of my website url and now we have a slice object and we can reuse this so to apply your slice object type in the name your string index operator and place your slice right within here and let's print this so print our website and apply the slice to it and now this should give us just the website name and now let's test this with maybe another website i'll rename this as website one and let's create website2 and let's try a different website name for goodmeasure so let's try wikipedia so we can reuse our slice object and we will apply our slice to website two this time and this should remove the url portions http as well as com all right everybody so that is slicing strings in python you can either use the indexing operator or the slice function to create a slice object if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how string slicing works in python hey what's going on people it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain if statements else if statements and else statements and python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people let's talk about if statements an if statement is a block of code that will execute only if its condition is true it's a very basic form of decision making with programming for this example let's create a prompt where we will ask a user for their age and depending on what their age is we will print a response so let's say age equals input and then we will add a prompt how old are you now this will return a string so we should probably cast this as an integer data type so we now have a variable called age where we will accept some user input let's check somebody's age with a variety of if statements so let's check to see if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 18 so to create an if statement type if and then some sort of condition if age is greater than or equal to 18 to finish this if statement add a colon at the end now pay attention to this if i move down to the next line you'll notice that my cursor is now indented any indented code underneath an if statement is the block of code for that if statement so if this condition is true we will execute some block of code if it's false we'll skip over it so if somebody's age is greater than or equal to 18 let's print you are an adult and let's try this program how old are you let's say i'm 21 so my condition when we get to the if statement is going to check to see if this condition is true if it is true we're going to execute this block of code if it's not we skip over it so how old are you let's say i'm 21 i'm going to hit enter and my if statement is true so we execute this block of code which prints you are an adult so what if this condition is false let's say i'm 12. well then we're just going to skip over this block of code and continue on with the rest of the program if you would like your program to take some other course of action if this condition is false we can add an else statement so after the if statement add else make sure you get the indentation right you don't want this within the block of code for the if statement so if this condition is false we can take some other course of action so if somebody's age is less than 18 let's print you are a child so let's try this again i'm going to enter that i am 12 years old not really but let's just pretend i am so this will now print you are a child if this condition is false perform this block of code for the else statement so with if statements we can check more than one condition before reaching the else statement by using an else if statement and we add that after an if statement so it's shortened to e l i f for else if so let's check to see if somebody's age is less than zero for some reason so let's print you haven't been born yet so with if statements we start at the top we first check the if statement if this is false we move down to the next statement to check then we check our else if statement if this is also false then we resort to the else statement the else statement is sort of like a last resort if all conditions evaluate to be false then we execute the else statement so let's try this how old are you let's say i'm negative 1 years old you haven't been born yet so with if statements we always begin with an if statement and we check that condition if that condition evaluates to be false then we will skip this block of code and move down to the else if statement if there is one it's optional if this condition is also false then we will use our else statement as a last resort if there is one if there is no else statement then we just skip over all of this then and continue on with the rest of the program so you can add more than one else if statement so let's check something else let's check to see else if age is equal to 100 so if you need to check to see if a value is equal to a particular value make sure you use double equal signs this is the comparison operator for equality if you use just one equal sign that's the assignment operator and python thinks you're attempting to set age equal to 100 so if you want to check to see if age is equal to 100 then use double equals so let's check to see if somebody's age is equal to 100 so let's print you are a century old now pay attention to this if i were to run this program how old are you let's say i'm 100. so this is printing you are an adult that's because we first check our if statement and well we're 100 years old and 100 is greater than or equal to 18. so we print this block of code we execute this block of code and then we skip everything else even though age is equal to 100 within our else if statement so the order of your if statements does matter so let's change this around let's add this to the very beginning and this will be our if statement and we will set age is greater than or equal to 18 to be an else if statement so we're first going to check to see if age is equal to 100 if not we will check to see if age is greater than or equal to 18 and we just follow that order so let's try this again how old are you i am 100 years old you are a century old so we first check our if statement if this condition is true we will execute this block of code if it's false we just go down the order till we reach our else statement well everybody that is the basics of if statements we have if statements else if statements and else statements so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that is how if statements work in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well in this video i'm going to explain logical operators in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody let's talk about logical operators these are used to check if two or more conditional statements are true so we'll be discussing the and as well as the or logical operators there's also a third one called not but that works a little bit different and i'll explain why so let's create a program to demonstrate this let's create a program where we will ask somebody for the temperature outside and then depending on the temperature if it falls within a certain range we will print a message so we'll need to use and as well as or logical operators to do this so here i have a prompt temp for temperature equals input what is the temperature outside so i'm going to cast this as an integer data type so what if we want to check to see if our temperature is within a certain range we can use the and logical operator to check two or more conditional statements this is how we might do that let's check if temp is greater than or equal to zero zero degrees celsius and we can check another condition too if temp is less than or equal to 30 degrees celsius so we need to add a colon at the end to finish this if statement and let me just fix some of the spacing okay so with the and logical operator in order for this entire condition to be true both conditions must be true this needs to be true and this needs to be true so if our temperature is equal to or above 0 as well as being less than or equal to 30 that means our temperature falls within a certain range so let's print a message such as the temperature is good today print go outside all right let's try it so what is the temperature outside let's say it's 20 degrees celsius well the temperature is good today go outside this condition is true 20 is greater than or equal to zero and temperature is less than or equal to 30. let's try a different temperature like negative 20 degrees celsius so it's really freaking cold outside right now as you can see nothing happened because our first condition was false our temperature is not greater than or equal to zero but our temperature is less than or equal to 30 so our second condition is true but our first condition was false and in order for this entire statement to be true since we're using the and logical operator both conditions must be true in order for this statement to be true now let's discuss the or logical operator we can check to see if our temperature is below or above a certain range so let's write else if temp is less than zero or temp is greater than 30. so that means it's going to be either very cold outside or very hot outside so let's print a message the temperature is bad today print stay inside all right let's try this again what is the temperature outside it is negative 20 degrees outside the temperature is bad today stay inside so with the orological operator as long as one of these conditions is true then the entire statement is true it doesn't matter if one of them is false as long as one of them is true then the entire statement is true last but not least we have the not logical operator this works a little bit different from the and as well as the or logical operator because we can check one or more conditional statements instead of two or more conditional statements so what the not logical operator will do is that it'll take a conditional statement if it's true it's going to flip it to false if it's normally false it's going to flip it to true so for this example we have another way in which we could write this although it's a little more complex so if our statement is true what we can do is that we can flip it to false using the not logical operator if it's normally false we can change it to true so what we'll do is surround one or more conditional statements with a set of parentheses and precede everything within the parentheses with the not logical operator so if the statement is normally true it's going to become false using the not logical operator if it's normally false it's going to be true then let's do the same with the else if statement so surround one or more conditional statements with the not logical operator so now these roles are going to be kind of reversed so let's try this again what is the temperature outside it is negative 20 degrees outside the temperature is good today go outside so what we should probably do is kind of reverse these rolls so i'm just going to swap everything within these if statements with each other and now this should work the same as it did before but we just wrote it a little bit different what is the temperature outside it is 15 degrees outside 15 degrees celsius the temperature is good today go outside so with the not logical operator you can surround one or more conditional statements with the not logical operator and what this will do is flip it from being false to true or from true to false well everybody that's the basics of logical operators in python if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of logical operators in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain while loops in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show so while loops a while loop is a statement that will execute its block of code as long as its condition remains true later on in this video for this example we're going to create a program where we will prompt a user to enter their name if they attempt to skip that prompt then we will continually ask the user to enter their name and they can't continue on with the rest of the program until they do so the key thing to keep in mind with while loops is that you'll want some way to eventually escape the while loop if you don't have any way to escape the while loop that's referred to as an infinite loop so let's create an example of an infinite loop because it's fun so to create a while loop type while and then some sort of condition so for our condition let's say while one is equal to one so this will always be true now what do we want to do when we execute this block of code let's print something print help i'm stuck in a loop all right so let's try this while one is equal to one print this statement and we will just continue on and on within this while loop because we have no way to escape this while loop so now let's use this concept and write a program where we will prompt a user to type in their name if they don't type in anything then we will continue to prompt them to type in at least something so let's say name is equal to and then to just keep this blank we'll just set this to a set of quotes and then let's write a while loop here while name and let's check the length of name if the length of our name is equal to zero then we will ask the user to type in their name name equals input enter your name so then once we escape the while loop let's print something print hello plus name whoops hello plus name alright so when i run this we are giving the user a way to escape the while loop they have to type in something for their name as long as the length of my name is equal to zero keep on printing this prompt enter your name so i'm just going to hit enter a bunch of times enter your name no enter your name no enter your name no so we are stuck within this loop until we enter something for our name so this time let me type in a name then hit enter so therefore our condition is now false the length of my name is now one two three so three is not equal to zero therefore our while statement our while loop is false and we continue on with the rest of the program there are a few variations in which you could write the same program so let's write this a different way what we could do is say name is equal to none while not name and this will pretty much do the same thing it's just another way of writing this well everybody that's the basics of while loops a while loop is a statement that will execute its block of code as long as its condition remains true for our example we asked the user to type in their name if they were to leave it empty or blank we would keep on asking the user to type in their name so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah that's the basics of while loops in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain for loops in python and at the end of this video we're going to create a countdown timer so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right guys and gals let's talk about for loops a for loop is a statement that will execute its block of code a limited amount of times it's similar but different from a while loop because a while loop could iterate an unlimited or infinite amount of times depending on the condition a for loop will only iterate a limited amount of times and before we start executing its block of code we already know how many times we're going to repeat this block of code so for this example let's create a for loop that will simply count it to 10 and then we'll create a few more sophisticated examples so to create a for loop that will count up to 10 this is what we'll type four and then we need some sort of counter people usually either write index or they shorten it to just i i for index four i in and we can set a range range ten so we will execute this for loop ten times and to finish this for loop just add a colon at the end so the next line or lines will be indented so that's the block of code for the for loop what do we want to do during each iteration let's just print what i is and let's take a look to see what would happen so we executed this for loop ten times except with computers computers always start with zero so when we said four i in range ten we're counting numbers zero through nine so it's as if this number is exclusive so there's two ways we can change this we could say range ten plus one or what i would do is say print i plus one so this will give us numbers one through ten so that's a for loop it will execute a limited amount of times this time let's count a range between two numbers not necessarily 0 to 10 but something else so let's say 4i in range maybe the numbers 50 through 100 so within my range function i will pass in two numbers the first number will be the starting point and the second number is the ending point this first number is inclusive and the second number is exclusive so let's print this print whatever i is so this will count 50 through 99 actually if you wanted to include this last number since it's exclusive what we could do is just add one to the end so this would give us 50 through 100 except that this will iterate 51 times since we're counting 50. so you just have to pay attention to your range and the numbers that it's counting now one thing that you can do with the range function is that you can add a third argument and this will function as the step how much you want to count up or down by so this time let's count up by two so i'll add comma two we're passing in a third argument this time so this program will now count up by two starting at fifty and go all the way to one hundred a benefit of for loops is that we can iterate through anything that is considered iterable this could include a string the letters in a string or any sort of collection so this time let's create a for loop that will iterate once through each letter in maybe a name so for i in and let's type a name here type in whatever your first name and last name is and then we will print whatever i is for i in whatever your name is print each letter in the string so when i run this each letter within my name will be printed to a new line all right people for my last trick we're going to create a program where we will simulate a countdown starting at 10 and count down to zero and then maybe once we reach zero we can print something such as happy new year so to create this program we'll need an import so at the top we're going to import the time module because we'll be waiting one second after each iteration of this for loop so to create this program let's say four you could say i but you can really write anything here and to demonstrate that let's say four seconds four seconds in range so the starting point is going to be ten the ending point will be zero and we'll add a step what do we want to count up or down by let's set this to negative one so this will be a countdown starting at ten and ending at zero so after each iteration let's print whatever i is or in this case seconds and then we can sleep have our thread sleep for a number of seconds too so after we print seconds type time dot sleep and pass in how long you want to sleep for i would like to sleep for one second and then at the end let's print happy new year make sure this isn't within the for loop print happy new year and well that's it let's test this so we'll begin at 10 and count down to zero and you can see that my thread that is running this program is sleeping for one second after each iteration of this for loop then once we reach zero it will display happy new year well everybody that's the basics of for loops a for loop is a statement that will execute its block of code a limited amount of times it's different from a while loop because a while loop could execute an infinite or unlimited amount of times with for loops they execute limited amounts of times and before we enter the for loop we already know how many times we're going to iterate this for loop if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's how for loops work in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain nested loops in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey all you people let's talk about nested loops a nested loop is a general concept of having one loop inside of another loop and that's really it it doesn't matter if it's a for loop or a while loop so the inner loop will finish all of its iterations before we finish one iteration of the outer loop and to best demonstrate this we're going to create a program where we will draw a rectangle made out of a certain symbol that we choose we need to set a width and a height and to best do this we'll need to use a nested loop we'll create a few prompts one for rows columns and a symbol that we want to make a rectangle of so let's begin with rows rows equals input how many rows and we'll need to cast this as an integer data type because we're working with numbers okay let's do the same thing for columns so replace rows with columns for this next line input how many columns and we'll create a symbol variable symbol equals input and this we don't have to cast enter a symbol to use now it's time for the nested loops we're going to create an outer for loop as well as an inner for loop the outer for loop will be in charge of the rows the inner for loop will be in charge of the columns so let's begin by creating our outer loop so we'll write 4 i in range rows we would like our outer for loop to iterate as many times as we have rows and we're going to create an inner for loop that will iterate as many times as we have columns so within the block of code for the outer for loop we're going to create another for loop this time it'll be four and a common convention for inner loops is to write j as an index because j comes after i i guess so for j in range columns so our inner for loop will iterate for as many times as we have columns all we'll do within the inner for loop is print our symbol that we have except we'll have one issue using a print statement after we use the print statement we will enter a new line character and move down to the next line we can actually prevent that by adding comma and equals quotes so after using a print statement this will prevent our cursor from moving down to the next line so pay attention to the indentation too so there's kind of two levels of indentation we're currently within the inner for loop so that's pretty much it for the inner for loop now we're going to print a new line once we exit the inner for loop and you can see that the indentation is on this line right here we're within the outer for loop now and that's pretty much it so let's try this program how many rows let's say five rows how many columns perhaps six what symbol do we want to use let's say the dollar sign and let's try it there we go there's our rectangle so we have let's see six columns one two three four five six and five rows one two three four five in summary a nested loop is really just this concept of having one loop inside of another loop it doesn't matter if it's a while loop or a for a loop it's really situational the inner loop will finish all of its iterations before finishing one iteration of the outer loop so what we did to demonstrate that is that we had the outer loop in charge the rows and an inner loop in charge of the columns for our rectangle program so if you would like a copy of this program i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's the basics of nested loops in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain loop control statements in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right ladies and gentlemen let's talk about loop control statements these are used to change a loop's execution from its normal sequence and there are three we're going to discuss break continue and pass let's begin with break break is used to terminate the loop entirely now here's a good example of where a break would be useful let's say while true we're going to continually ask for somebody's name if they don't type in anything then we'll continue the while loop over and over again so let's say name equals input enter your name now if name does not equal a set of quotes that means they don't type in anything then we will break and break out of this while loop and let's test it enter your name nah i don't think so i'm too lazy to enter my name all right i can see that i'm not going to escape this while loop so i'm going to type in my name because i give up and hit enter therefore i will break and exit out of this while loop so a break is used to terminate the loop entirely when it's encountered next we have continue continue skips to the next iteration of the loop now let's say we have a phone number phone underscore number and i will set the sequel to let's say a random phone number including dashes 123-456-7890 what i would like to do is to display this number within the console window without these dashes this is how to do that using a continue control statement for i in phone number so for each character within our string of phone number what we'll do is check to see if we encounter a dash character if i i is our index is equal to a dash then we want to continue and skip over this iteration of the loop so continue then i would like to print whatever our indexes whatever character we're working on so if i were to run this as it is it's going to print each digit on a new line so with print statements they will add a new line character to the end of your string and you can actually change that by adding to the end comma end equals and then a set of quotes so this will print my phone number without any dashes one two three four five six seven eight nine zero so that's a use of the continue control statement it skips to the next iteration of the loop last but not least we have pass pass does nothing it acts as a placeholder let's say that i would like to print the numbers 1 through 20 using a for loop for i in range 1 through 21 and remember that the second digit is exclusive so this will iterate once through the digits of 1 through 20. let's pretend that i'm highly superstitious and i don't want to print the number 13 because 13 is considered an unlucky number if i is equal to 13 what we'll do is pass and pass acts as a placeholder and it won't do anything else print i that's one i there we go this will print the numbers 1 through 20 and skip 13 because we used the past control statement which does nothing it acts as a placeholder so everybody those are loop control statements they change a loop's execution from its normal sequence we have break continue and pass so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah those are a few loop control statements in python what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain lists in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right ladies and gentlemen let's get down to business i got to explain lists to you all now a list is used to store multiple items within a single variable for example let's say we have a variable called food and i will store a string value of pizza because i like pizza what we could do is that we can store multiple items within this variable by turning this variable into a list and in order to do so we're going to surround all of the values that we would like to add to our list with a set of square brackets and boom there you have it we now have a list called food it is no longer a variable so what we could do is add multiple items to this list of food so let's add some other food items that we might like let's see i also like maybe some hamburgers and a hot dog and maybe some spaghetti i think i smelled spaghetti right okay so we now have a list called food now what happens if we attempt to print this list of food so print food so this will print all of the elements found in this list each item in a list is referred to as an element if we need to access a certain element of this list we have to list the index so next to our list we'll add a set of square brackets again and we need to list the numbered index of the element that we're trying to access now computers they always start with zero so the first element in our list would be element number zero the next one would be one two and three so if we need to access element zero which is in the first position we would say food square brackets and then within here list the index so the first position is zero and this will now print the first element of our list which is pizza let's attempt to access some of these other elements so the element at index one would be you guessed it hamburger two would be hot dog and three would be spaghetti now what happens if we attempt to access the element at index four well currently that's out of range because we did not assign a value so we're experiencing an error an index out of range error but if i were to add another element let's say pudding alright well then the element at index 4 would be putting then one important concept with lists is that you can always update and change the elements found within a list later on in the program after you declare one so let's say we would like to immediately change one of these elements let's say food at index zero i want to replace with maybe sushi because sushi is great so if i were to print the element at index 0 this would no longer be pizza because we updated element 0 to be sushi then and this prints sushi now if you need to display all of the elements found within a list you can easily do so with a standard for loop what we'll do is say for x in the name of our list which is food print x and let me turn this line into a comment all right so this for loop will print all of the elements found within our list of food and the results are sushi hamburger hot dog spaghetti and pudding all right people for this next portion i'm going to demonstrate a few useful functions of lists and to access some of these functions type the name of your list dot and there's a bunch to choose from here let's begin with event we can add an element to this list let's say at the end i would like to add ice cream so then if i were to display my list we now have ice cream at the end because we appended this value to my list of food so let's go over a few others so we can also remove a value food dot remove let's say i would like to remove hotdog so i'm going to type that within my function and this will remove hotdog and that is no longer here next we can pop food.pop pop will remove the last element so this will remove pudding we can insert a value at a given index food dot insert we need to list an index let's say zero that would be the first position technically that's where pizza is currently and i would like to add cake and at index 0 we now have cake so next up we have sort food dot sort this will sort a list alphabetically so in the first position we have hamburger hot dog pudding spaghetti then sushi we can also clear a list food dot clear and this will remove all of the elements of a list so this will not print anything because we cleared the list well everyone in conclusion a list is really just a variable that can store multiple values think of it that way so if you would like a copy of all the code that we have written here today i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how lists work in python how's it going everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain 2d lists in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show i have a super quick video for you all today on 2d lists also referred to as multi-dimensional lists all it is is a list of separate lists so let's begin by creating a few separate lists let's say we have a list called drinks and let's assign a few values let's say we have coffee as well as soda and maybe some tea all right so we currently have one list let's make maybe two more let's make a list called dinner and maybe in here we'll place pizza then hamburger and hot dog okay then let's create one more for this example let's say dessert and maybe we'll add two items they all don't need the same amount of items or elements so we have cake and ice cream all right so we have three lists one called drinks dinner and dessert so what we can do is add all of these lists to one list and let's create a list called food food equals and for each of these elements we're going to place our lists so we have drinks dinner and dessert check this out what if i were to print my 2d list of food so what ends up happening is that this will print all of the elements found within each individual list and they're all grouped together so this first portion is my drinks list which contains coffee soda tea this next element is my dinner list which contains pizza hamburger hot dog and the last element dessert contains cake and ice cream if i need to access just one of these lists i will add an index after my food 2d list and set an index number so index zero is referring to my first list of drinks and this will display all of the elements found within my first list and if i need just one of these elements i will add a second set of square brackets and list the index of the item that i'm trying to access so this very first item coffee would be index zero and then index zero again so we need two sets of square brackets and if i were to print this this will display coffee so if i go down the list the next element would be soda and then t if i were to change the index within this first set of square brackets well now we're working with a different list this time we're working with our dinner list so the element at index 1 index 2 that would be our dinner list and this will display the element of hot dog if i change this to the next list which would be dessert well we're going to receive an index out of range error because we only have two values within this list cake and ice cream there is no element at index 2 because we only added two elements to this list of dessert all right everybody so that is 2d lists also referred to as multi-dimensional lists it's a list of separate lists if you need to access one of the elements within your 2d list you need two sets of square brackets so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that's how 2d lists work in python hey what's going on people it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain tuples in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show so tuples they are collections which are ordered and unchangeable they're very similar to lists but they're ordered and we can't change them they're useful for grouping together related data let's say we would like to create some sort of student record so we can create a tuple to take care of that for us so let's say we would like to create a tuple called student the process of creating a tuple is very similar to lists but instead of using a set of square brackets to place all of the values within we're going to use a set of parentheses and now we can add a bunch of values related to this collection of student so let's add some student information let's say that this student's name is bro let's give him an age as well as a gender all right so there you have it we now have a tuple called student and let's take a look at some of the functions related to tuples and you can access them by typing student dot and then there are a few here not as many as lists we have count and we have index so we can find the count of how many times a value appears let's count how many times the value of bro appears so we'll need to put this within a print statement so we can actually see it so bro appears one time within this tuple there is also an index method as well so type the name of your tuple dot and we will use the index method we can find the index of a certain value let's say we would like to find the index of mail and then i will just print this to the console window so the index of the value mail would be at two zero one two that's it for the methods available to tuples a few tricks that you can do with tuples is that you can display all of the contents within a tuple using a for loop let's say 4x in student we will print x so this will iterate once through all the values found within our tuple of student and we can also check to see if a certain value exists within our tuple using an if statement let's say if bro in student if this is true then what do we want to do let's say print bro is here all right so since bro is within here this will be true and this will print our statement of bro is here all right everybody like i said this is a super quick video on tuples they're very similar to lists except they are ordered and unchangeable if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below and don't forget to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain what a set is in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show a set is a collection which is unordered as well as being unindexed they do not allow any duplicate values for example let's create a set of silverware so in order to create a set we need a name for this set let's call it utensils equals and in order to create a set we need to surround all values with a set of curly braces now let's add a few utensils to the set called utensils let's add a fork a spoon and maybe a knife and that should be good and let's display all of the values for x in utensils print x now with sets they're different from lists because they're unordered as well as being unindexed if i were to print all of the elements in utensils they might not necessarily be in the same order in which we placed them for example when we printed all of the elements found within utensils first we had a knife a fork and then a spoon if i were to run this again they might be in a different order kind of like that so a set is actually faster than a list if you need to check to see if something is within a set compared to a list and they do not allow any duplicate values let me add a bunch of knives and let's see what happens so i'll have a total of three knives but when we print all of the elements of the set only one knife appears so here's a few useful methods of sets the first method is that we can add an item to our set so type in the name of the set in this case it's utensils dot and here's a bunch of methods that you can use i am looking for add and we can add an element to the set i would like to add a napkin and then if we were to print the set we do have a napkin within the set we can also remove an element utensils dot remove and i would like to remove the fork and now our fork is gone we can also clear utensils dot clear and all the elements within our set should be gone so let me turn these lines into a comment all right for this next example we'll need a second set let's create a second set called dishes and then we need a set of curly braces and let's add a bowl a plate and a cup our next method is that we're going to add one set to another by using the update method let's say we would like to add our dishes set to our utensil set so let's type utensils dot and use the update method and within this method we will pass in the set that we would like to add so utensils update dishes this will add all of the elements found within dishes to our utensil set and you can see that when we print our utensils we have a bowl a plate and a cup in here as well and then if i were to switch these around let's say dishes update utensils and then i will print everything found within dishes now there's a fork a spoon and a knife in here as well we can also join two sets together and create a new set entirely so let's create a set called dinner table like we're setting up a dinner table and we need a fork a spoon a knife a bowl a plate and a cup so we have a dinner table set we're going to set the sequel to either utensils dot union dishes or we could do dishes union utensils either way would work and let's display all the elements found within dinner table and we should now have elements from both sets utensils and dishes as well there are also some methods in which we can compare the similarities as well as the differences between the elements found within two sets let's say i would like to check to see what utensils has that dishes doesn't and for this example i think i'll add a knife to my dishes set just so that they have at least one thing in common so i would like to see what utensils has that dishes doesn't so we can do so using the difference method and i will print the results with a print statement so i'm going to compare utensils against dishes utensils dishes and this will print what utensils has that dishes doesn't which is a fork as well as a spoon and we can reverse the rolls too we could say dishes difference utensils what do dishes have that utensils doesn't and dishes has a cup a bowl and a plate they both have knives so that's why knife isn't appearing we can also check to see if there's anything that they have in common using the intersection method so i'll turn this line into a comment we'll print utensils dot intersection dishes and this will return whatever element that they have in common which is a knife all right everybody in conclusion a set is a collection which is unordered as well as being unindexed they do not allow any duplicate values and you can do things like compare two sets see if there's anything that they have in common any differences and we can add or remove elements to a set if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below don't be afraid to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how dictionaries work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's get down to business a dictionary is a changeable unordered collection of unique key value pairs they're fast because they use hashing and they allow us to access a value quickly now to create a dictionary it's very similar to creating a set based on the last video except we're going to store unique key value pairs let's create a dictionary of countries and their capitals we can store those as key value pairs so let's call this dictionary capitals capitals equals then we need a set of curly braces much like what we use with sets now we need a key and a value let's say we have the usa as a key and the capital of the usa would be washington dc so in order to associate a value with the key we'll follow the key with a colon and then add some value and the data type really doesn't matter but in this case we're just using strings so the capital of the usa would be washington dc and to add another key value pair we'll separate each with a comma and let's add a few others for good measure so let's say we have india next as a key and the value would be new delhi and we'll add two more let's say we have china and the capital of china is beijing and lastly let's add russia and the capital of russia is moscow and there you have it ladies and gentlemen we now have a dictionary called capitals that has unique key value pairs so remember with dictionaries they are unordered in order to access one of these values instead of using a numbered index we're going to use the associated key with that value here's an example let's say i would like to print the capital of russia so i need to use this key of russia so in order to do this type in the name of the dictionary followed by a set of straight brackets and then instead of an index number like 0 or 1 2 3 i'm going to use the key so i would like to print the value that's stored or associated with the key of russia so when i run this this will print that value which is moscow so this isn't always safe let's say we have a key that doesn't exist like germany germany is not currently within my dictionary so if i were to run this well then my program is going to encounter an error and this will interrupt the normal flow of my program a much safer way to access a key to check to see if it's there or not is to use the get method of dictionaries so i'm going to turn this line into a comment and let's try this again but this time we'll use the get method so type in the name of the dictionary dot get and list the key that you want to use so i would like to see if germany is within my dictionary currently there isn't so this will return none and we will not encounter an error so this is a much safer way of checking to see if there is a key within your dictionary here's a few other useful methods there is a method to print only the keys so we type in the name of the dictionary capitals and here's a listing of all of the methods that we have access to i'm looking for the keys method and this will print only the keys and not the values we can also print just the values and not the keys so type in the name of the dictionary again capitals dot values and this will print only the values or you could print everything both the keys and the values and you do so by using the items method capitals dot items and this will print your entire dictionary one other way in which we can display all of the key value pairs in a dictionary is to use a for loop so at the end let's create a for loop for key comma value in capitals dot items this is going to iterate once for each key value pair in my dictionary for each key value in capitals dot items print key comma value and this will print my entire dictionary a feature of dictionaries is that they are mutable that means we can change them or alter them after the program is already running so one way in which we can do that is to use the update method of dictionaries so let's add germany as a key and give it a value of berlin so type in the name of the dictionary capitals and we'll use the update method and within the parentheses of this method we'll add a set of curly braces and now we can add a new key value pair so let's add germany and a value of berlin so if i were to run this and display all of the key value pairs found within my dictionary we now have germany as a key and berlin as its value not only can you use the update method to add a new key value pair but you can update an existing one let's say we would like to change the capital of usa so capitals dot update parentheses curly braces list the key usa colon and then we can give the usa a new value let's pretend that the united states government has decided to relocate their capital to las vegas so this will now update our key of usa with a new value and if i were to print all of the key value pairs found within my dictionary of capitals the usa has a new value of las vegas so the last two methods i'm going to cover are both pop and clear you can use the pop method to remove a key value pair so capitals dot pop parentheses and list the key of the key value pair that you would like to remove so let's say we would like to remove china so we'll list that key and then when we use the pop method that will remove this key value pair from my dictionary and then of course we have clear as well which will just remove everything capitals dot clear and this will clear my dictionary all right everybody so in conclusion a dictionary is a changeable unordered collection of unique key value pairs they're fast because they use hashing and they allow us to access a value quickly well that's the basics of dictionaries in python if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how dictionaries work in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the index operator in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people let's begin i'm going to be explaining the index operator which is represented by a set of square brackets now they give access to a sequences elements they include but are not limited to strings lists and tuples for this example we're going to be working with strings because strings are easy to work with let's say we have a name and name equals whatever your first and last name is we can use the index operator to access an element of the sequence our string so let's check to see if the first letter in our name is lowercase and i should probably change that to lowercase for this example so within an if statement if name and we can add a set of square brackets after our sequence which is a string and we can check a given element of our sequence let's check to see if the first letter is lowercase now with computers they always start at zero if you need to access the first element in a sequence that would be index zero and then the next sequence well the next element in the sequence would be one then two then you followed that pattern so i would like to check to see if name at index zero that would be the first character is lowercase so there is a method to check that dot is lower this will return true or false if the first letter is lowercase then our if statement is going to be resolved to true and what i could do is that i can perhaps change it to uppercase then so let's reassign name to equal name dot and there is a capitalize function here and then let's print our name print name so when we run this the first letter in my name is now capitalized so if you need to access an element within a sequence a string or list or a tuple you would add a set of square brackets afterwards and then you list an integer of the element that you're trying to access so here's a few other examples i'm going to turn this as well as this into a comment and let's say we would like to create some substrings and we can do so using our index operator so i would like to create a substring from the first part of my name so what i'll do is create a new variable first name equals name index operator so you can specify a range for an index operator so you would set the starting position on the left hand side followed by a colon and then your ending position so i would like the substring to begin at index 0 and end at 3 so that would be 0 colon then three all right and then i would like to make this all uppercase for some reason and then let's print my first name so with the index operator we specified a range we would like to access elements 0 through 3. turn them up your case and assign them to a new variable of first name here's a shortcut that you might find useful if the index for your range begins with zero you can actually delete that you don't even necessarily need that zero now we just have a colon three and this would work the same as it did before so that's a useful shortcut and we're going to bring it up later if we need to access the last element in a sequence this time let's create a substring of last name so last name equals name index operator this time i would like to access the element at index let's see 0 1 2 3 4. all right so i'm going to say for colon and we're not really sure where our name our last name is going to end so what you could do is just say colon and then leave the next index blank so that will be the index beginning at four and everything afterwards and let's say two lower to make this all lowercase for some reason so let's print our last name print last name so this should take everything starting at index 4 and after that and turn it into its own substring of last name now you can access the last element in a sequence by using what's called negative indexing so let's add a exclamation point to the end of our name so let's say we have a new variable called last character and i would like to store the last character in my name to this new variable this new substring so to access the last element in a sequence within the index operator we can use negative indexing so the last element would be negative one all right and then let's print whatever our last character is so this should print an exclamation point yep which did so then if this was negative 2 that would be the second to last element in a sequence so now that would be e because e is in the second to last element in my sequence all right everybody so that's the basics of the index operator you can add a set of square brackets after a string a list or a tuple and then list an integer or a range of the elements that you're trying to access so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post everything in the comments down below don't be afraid to help me out and smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how functions work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay let's do this thing a function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called this process is also known as invoking a function with programming we try not to repeat code if we don't have to that's why functions are useful because our function can perform some specific task for us some block of code for us whenever it is called so we only need to write that block of code once and if we need to repeat it we just call this function one more time so let's define and create a function we'll create a function called hello and in order to define a function we'll type def and then a unique function name so let's call this function hello and with functions they always end with a set of parentheses and lastly to finish defining this function we'll add a colon at the end so if you go down to the next line take notice that my cursor is now indented any code underneath a function that is indented belongs to that specific function and will only execute whenever that function is called so for now we need to type in something if you don't know what you want your function to do you can always type pass for now but let's print something print the word hello and in order to call this function all we need to do within our program is type the name of the function which is hello and then add a set of parentheses because functions always end with a set of parentheses so what this will do is execute my function once and perform this block of code whenever it is called if i were to remove this well our program currently isn't going to do anything because functions only execute their block of code only when it is called so this time let's print the word hello three times so i will call this function three separate times hello hello hello so when i run this our hello function will be called three separate times now with functions they are not limited to just one line this is an entire block of code so maybe we can do something else too let's print have a nice day now if i were to run this my hello function is going to execute this entire block of code three separate times hello have a nice day now an important feature of functions is that we can send our function some information and our function can do something with that information that it receives let's say this time i would like to print hello plus somebody's name currently name is an unresolved reference what we can do when we call this function is send our function some information this can be a value a variable a collection all sorts of different things so if you need to send your function some information within the parentheses when you call that function just list the data that you want to send your function so let's say i would like to send my function a string value of bro whatever your first name is when you send information to a function these are called arguments they are the information that you're sending to a function and when you define that function you need a matching set of what is known as parameters so our hello function is going to receive one argument a string value we need a matching number of parameters currently this isn't going to work you can see here that hello takes zero positional arguments but one was given our function needs a matching number of parameters so think of it this way when we receive this value we're going to give a nickname to this value so when we receive the string value what do we want to call it well let's call it name so in order to add parameters to your function just list the parameters within the parentheses of that function and well this should work now we have a matching set of arguments and parameters when we call the hello function this time we are sending one argument over and when our hello function receives this argument we're going to give it a temporary nickname of name or you can call this whatever you want to and then we can use this value for whatever we want within our function now if we were to run this this will print hello bro have a nice day now i can send maybe a different value let's say hello and then i will send a string value of dude hello dude have a nice day so this isn't limited to just values we can send variables to let's say we have a variable called name equals bro and this time i'm going to send this variable over hello and then send name so these don't need to be the exact same let's say this is my name and i'm going to send my name over and i will temporarily give this value a nickname of just name and then i can use this variable for something hello bro have a nice day now with arguments you can send more than one value over let's say this time i would like to send two values over so let's send pro maybe for a first name and code for a second name but you can use your first name and last name so this isn't going to work because we do not have a matching set of arguments and parameters we're sending two arguments over but our function is only designed to accept one argument because we have one parameter so let's rename name as first name and we need two parameters this time so what are we going to call this value when we receive it let's call this last name so this time we are going to receive two values they will be nicknamed first name and last name so this time let's print hello first name maybe i'll add a space plus last name and this is now valid hello bro code have a nice day with arguments you can mix and match the data types that you're sending as arguments so currently we're sending two string values as arguments this time let's send an integer value let's say we would like to send an edge over to our hello function so i'll just send maybe the value of 21. so currently this isn't going to work because the hello function takes two positional arguments but three were given when we call this hello function we're sending this argument over but our function doesn't know what to do with this argument so we need a matching parameter for this value that it receives so let's call this value maybe edge as a temporary nickname and then we can do something with this value when we receive it so let's print an additional message perhaps u r plus age plus years old so if you need to display an integer or number along with the string you do need to convert it to a string so let's just cast our edge as a string when we display this so this should work now we now have a matching number of arguments and parameters so this will display hello bro code you are 21 years old have a nice day so ladies and gentlemen in conclusion a function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called if i were to remove this function call well then our program is just going to completely ignore this function and this block of code would not be executed when we call this function we can pass information known as arguments but we need a matching number of parameters set up to receive these arguments there are a few advanced features of parameters but i'll hopefully get to that in future videos we'll just stick with the basics for now of functions so that's the basics of functions if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that is how functions work in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the return statement in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people let's begin the return statement is used within functions to send python values or objects back to the caller these values or objects are known as the function's return value so do you know how with functions we can pass arguments to a function and then our function can do something with those arguments well not only that but our function can pass some value or object back to the caller so what we'll do for this example is create a function that will simply multiply two numbers together and return the result back to the caller so let's define a function called multiply and we'll set up two parameters for this function let's say number one and number two and what we'll do is say result equals number one times number two and then at the end we can return something what do we want to return let's return whatever the result is now when we call this function we will pass in two values as arguments let's say we would like to multiply six times eight so when we run this well we can't actually see anything when we return the result after multiplying numbers one and two it's going to return the result back to the caller in order to see the value that is returned back to the caller one way in which we can do this is to print the value that is returned within a print statement so what we'll do is print the value that is returned after calling the multiply function so 6 times 8 is really great 6 times 8 is 48 now one other thing that we can do is store the returned value within a variable so let's say x equals multiply 6 times 8 and then we will print whatever x is so the result is still the same of 48 now with the return value there is another way in which we could write this that uses less lines of code so we'll delete this first line and instead of returning a variable called result what we'll do is just return number one times number two and this would work the same as it does before but it's written in less lines of code so that's another way in which you could write this all right everybody so that is the return statement functions can send python values or objects back to the caller these values or objects are known as the functions return value you can either print this value directly to the console window or you can store it within a variable or some other location and well ladies and gentlemen that is how the return statement works in python what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain keyword arguments in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody let's discuss keyword arguments these are arguments that are preceded by an identifier when we pass them to a function the order of the arguments doesn't matter unlike positional arguments which do matter and we've been working with positional arguments already and python knows the names of the arguments that our function receives when we use keyword arguments here's an example of us using positional arguments and then i'll demonstrate the benefits of keyword arguments let's say we have a function called hello that accepts three arguments a first name a middle name and a last name and the output will be hello first name middle name last name so if i were to run this this will display hello bro dude code so we're using positional arguments the order of the arguments does matter what do you think's gonna happen if i were to replace some of these values let's say i will swap the first argument with the third argument so let's try it again hello code dude bro so obviously the order of the arguments matters and now if we were to use keyword arguments then the order of the arguments doesn't matter but with each argument we need to precede each argument with a unique identifier and that identifier is the name of the parameter we want to associate each argument with so for my intended last name i will use an identifier of last to match this parameter so dude will be middle middle equals dude and bro will be first even though they're not in the correct order so let's try this again and my output is hello bro dude code so that's all about keyword arguments they are arguments preceded with an identifier when we pass them to a function the order of the arguments doesn't matter unlike positional arguments which do matter and then python knows the names of the arguments that our function receives when we use keyword arguments so that's it for keyword arguments if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's how keyword arguments work in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain nested function calls in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people nested function calls these are function calls inside of other function calls and this is possible because certain functions will return a value and we can immediately use that value as an argument for the next function so here's an example let's say that we have the small program where we will ask a user to type in a whole positive number and let's say i don't let's say i type in negative 3.14 and then i'm storing that value within a variable named num what i'm going to do is convert that number to a floating point number because currently it's a string when you accept user input i will find the absolute value of num and then round it to the nearest whole number and then print the value so we can actually do this using less lines of code with nested function calls so let's start with the first function which will be accepting some user input the input function so this will be in the very center of our nested function calls and then the next function we would like to apply to the variable that is returned the value that is returned we will pass in as an argument to our next function of casting this data type to a float so we'll surround our function with another function and use the float function and then we'll just keep on adding layers to this so we have the absolute value function next so we'll add another layer and we have the round function so we'll add a layer to that and lastly we're going to print and that'll be the outermost layer so this program will do the exact same thing let's say negative 3.14 except we've written this with one line of code so basically we start with the innermost function and resolve that first whatever value is returned we use as an argument to the next outermost function and in this case it would be float then we resolve that then move on to absolute value then round and then print so it's just another way of writing code that takes up less lines but this is more of an extreme example you probably won't see like four or five nested functions well everybody those are nested function calls if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah those are nested function calls in python hey what's going on people it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you how variable scope works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right let's do a thing people let's discuss the scope of a variable now the scope of a variable is the region that a variable is recognized a variable is only available from inside the region that it is created let's say that we have a function and i just gave this function a name of display name i created a variable inside of this function named name and you can assign this a value of whatever your name is preferably a last name for this example and what i'll do is just print whatever my name is so this variable is known to have a local scope because it's declared inside of a function and a variable is only recognized inside of the region that it is created this variable of name since it's created inside of this function it is known as a local variable that has a local scope it's only available inside of this function that it's created now let's attempt to access this variable from outside of our function so i'm going to print my name variable but we'll have an issue though so name name is not defined so local variables are declared inside of a function and they have a local scope they are only available inside of this function in which they're created on the other hand a global variable is a variable that is declared outside of any function but within your module that you're working with a global variable is known to have a global scope they are available inside and outside of any functions now if i was to print my name variable this is going to print bro or whatever your first name is and it is entirely possible to have both a global and local version of the same named variable so we have both a global version of name as well as a local version of name if i was to print my name variable from outside of this function it's going to print my global version however if i print my version of name inside of that function in which it's created we're going to first use the local version before the global version of name and let's try that so i'm going to call my display name function and this will print my last name code and then my first name of bro so it is possible to have a global and local version of the same named variable now if i was to remove this line where we declare a local version of name well then the next best available name to us would be the global version of name so if you use a variable inside of a function you'll first use a local version of that variable if it's available if not you'll use a global version instead and python will follow this rule known as the legb rule you use any local variables first then enclosed variables then global and then any built-in variables in that order so that's the main difference between local scope and global scope the scope of a variable is the region in which it's available and it's limited to the region in which it's created a local scope is available only inside of the function in which that variable is created a global scoped variable is a variable that is available inside and outside of any functions but within your module that you're working with so that's variable scope in python if you would like a copy of this code i will post this code to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how variable scope works in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the arcs parameter in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right guys and gals let's talk about args now args is a parameter that will pack all arguments into a tuple it's useful so that a function can accept a varying amount of arguments here's an example of why it would be useful let's say we have a function called add that will accept two numbers as arguments and add them together and return the sum so this works as intended right as long as we pass in only two numbers but what if we need to pass in three numbers as arguments well we can no longer use this add function because we have two parameters set up but we're passing in three arguments you can see here within my console window that we have a type error add takes two positional arguments but three were given and one way in which we can solve this issue is to use this args parameter so what we're going to do is replace all of our parameters with asterisk args and actually the args portion isn't as important as the asterisk args is short for arguments and you can really name this whatever you want just be sure that you have this asterisk because with this asterisk we're doing a form of packing what we're doing is passing all of these arguments and packing them into a tuple so let's rewrite this program so let's say maybe sum equals zero and then we will need to iterate through all of the items within our tuple because tuples are iterable so let's say for i in args what we'll do is say sum plus equals whatever i is and at the end when we escape the for loop we will return our sum so let's try it again and see if it works well would you look at that it works let's pass in a few other arguments for good measure let's pass in six arguments this time all right look at that this does in fact work so you can actually name this whatever you want the important thing is to have this asterisk so let's rename this as i don't know stuff and let's try this again yep it still works with tuples they are ordered and unchangeable let's attempt to edit one of these values so let's say stuff at index zero is equal to zero and let's try and change it so you can see that tuple object does not support item assignment if you need to change one of the values within your tuple after you pack all of these arguments you might need to convert this to a different collection one way in which we can do that is to cast it let's say stuff equals and we'll cast our tuple as a list because a list can be changeable it's mutable so let's attempt this again we'll cast our tuple as a list and then edit one of the values and then add all the values together so to change one of the values say the name your collection stuff in this case let's say at index zero this now equals zero so now if we were to add all these items together they should equal 20. there we go so yeah that's basically the args parameter the name isn't as important as the asterisk because you can really name it whatever you want a common convention is to just name this args it's a parameter that will pack all arguments into a tuple it's useful so that a function can accept a varying amount of arguments well that is all about args if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how the args parameter works in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be explaining quarks in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody let's talk about quarkx now this is a parameter that will pack all arguments into a dictionary it's useful so that a function can accept a varying amount of keyword arguments it's identical to args except with args args will accept a varying amount of positional arguments and pack them into a tuple with quarks this will accept a varying amount of keyword arguments and pack them into a dictionary so here's an example of why this would be useful let's say we have a function called hello that accepts two keyword arguments a first name and a last name all this will do is output hello your first name and last name but what if somebody has more than two names let's say somebody has a middle name and for this example i'll just say my middle name is dude so if i were to run this well this hello function is no longer going to work as you can see in the console window we have a type error the hello function got an unexpected keyword argument middle one way in which we can solve this we can use this quark's parameter so we can accept a varying amount of keyword arguments so what we'll do is replace our parameters with two asterisks then quarks now if i would like the same output as i had before i'm going to need to change a few things around in order to access a value within a dictionary you type the name of the dictionary square brackets and then within quotes list your key so i would like to access the value at this key of first and let's repeat the process for last name so the key is going to be last we'll access this value at this key and this should work the same as it did before now let's take this a step further let's say we would like to display somebody's full name based on the amount of keyword arguments that they pass into this function well there's a few different ways in which we could do this one easy way is that we could write our program like this let's print the word hello and we will need to iterate once through each key value pair within this dictionary and we can use a for loop to do that so to iterate once through each key value pair in your dictionary we'll type for key value in the name of our dictionary quarks in this case dot items and then we will print each value so there's one more thing that we need to do this kind of works as intended but it's going to print each value including our word hello on a new line so with a standard print statement this will print a new line character after each print statement as if we're hitting enter we can actually change that so after your string add and equals and we can replace that new line character with something else maybe a space and let's do the same thing for our for loop so value comma end and then just add space now this will print all of your names on the same line hello bro dude code and now we can pass in a varying amount of keyword arguments based on how long our name is perhaps we have like a title title equals mr and we can print that as well hello mr bro dude code here's a fun fact of the day you don't necessarily need to name this parameter as quarks the important thing is to have these double asterisks that precede it quarks is just a common naming convention it's short for keyword arguments you could name this as something else perhaps something more descriptive like names since we're passing in a bunch of names so the name of our dictionary is now names and this would work the same as it did before the important thing is to have these double asterisks that precede the name of your dictionary but quarks is the common naming convention well everybody that's all about quarkx it's a parameter that will pack a varying amount of keyword arguments into a dictionary if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how quarkx works in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the format method in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay ladies and gentlemen let's begin the format method is a method available to strings it's optional and it gives users more control when displaying output to best demonstrate this i'm going to use a line from a popular nursery rhyme titled hey diddle diddle because well you know i'm a mature adult like that i'll be printing this line to my console window the cow jumped over the moon let's do so using a standard print statement and then i'll show you the benefits of using the format method later for this example i have two variables a variable called animal and i'm going to store a string of cow and item and i'll be storing an item name which is moon when we compile and run this as you would expect the output is the cow jumped over the moon there's a more elegant way of writing this line of code and that is by using the format method available to strings i'm going to turn this line into a comment and we're instead going to produce the same output but use the format method instead so we need a standard print statement like usual and then a string that we would like to format so we're going to write the same thing but in place of the variables we're going to add a placeholder the instead of the variable name or value name i'm going to add a set of curly braces so that functions as a placeholder for a value or a variable the this should be cow jumped over the and i'm going to insert another placeholder now this is a string we can format the string by following this string with dot format parenthesis and within the parentheses of the format method we can insert some values or variables let's begin with some values i would like to insert cow as well as moon so this will produce the same output but it's written a little more elegantly we can also replace these with variables because they store these values so i'm going to replace cow with animal and moon with item and this will create the same output as it did before these curly braces are what's known as format fields they function as a placeholder for a value or a variable and they work in order the first format field will insert the first value at this location if you have another set or more sets of this format field you'll insert the next value that's listed within the format method so if we were to switch these around we'll switch the position of animal with item well then the first format field is going to insert our item and the second format field will insert our animal this time the moon jumped over the cow an additional way of inserting values at a given place holder would be to use what's referred to as a positional argument within these format fields we will list the index of the value that we would like to insert at this location if you need to insert the first value well that has an index of zero because computers always start with zero and following that pattern the next index would be one if you had let's say three values that you need to insert if you had another placeholder that would be two then so you would just follow that pattern so there's going to be no visible change but what we could do is reverse the positional arguments of these placeholders so what do you think would happen if i switched one with zero at these locations well this format field is going to insert the value found at index one this first value is index zero and the second one is index one so now the roles are reversed this time the moon jumped over the cow our last way of inserting some values at a given format field would be to use what's referred to as a keyword argument within the format method we're going to list some keyword argument pairs we need a keyword name followed by a value so let's say animal is going to be the keyword we're going to say equals some value animal equals cow and item equals moon and you may have noticed that the color of your text might have changed so we no longer need these variables actually um but i'm going to comment out these two print statements because we will get an error then so these are in keyword argument pairs and within our format field instead of keeping these empty or using an index we can use the keyword name at my first format field i'm going to insert my keyword of animal and at my second format field i would like to insert the item keyword so the result is going to be the cow jumped over the moon so let's reverse these now we'll place our item keyword here and then at the second format field we will insert our animal and this time the moon jumped over the cow here's an important concept that i'd like to bring to your attention with these values found within the format method you can actually reuse some of these more than once so let's say we would like to state the animal jumped over the animal we're going to use this animal keyword twice and our output is going to be the cow jumped over the cow if we're doing the same thing with positional arguments we can reuse the same index this time let's say that the moon jumped over the moon so our item has an index of one so within our first format field we'll state the index will be one and our second format field will also be one so our output's going to be the moon jumped over the moon all right let's take things up a level there's an even more elegant way in which we could write all of this what we'll do is store our string that we would like to format within a variable let's turn this line into a comment and let's create a variable called text text equals the string that we would like to format which is the format field jumped over the format field and if we need to format this variable we can just call the format method on it so within a print statement let's say text dot and then use the format method and pass in the values that we would like to insert at these placeholders so we're going to insert animal as well as item so our result as you would imagine is the cow jumped over the moon this next section i'm going to explain how we can add some padding to a string when we display it using the format method let's say we have a name variable and assign this a value of whatever your name is so i would like to display my name along with the custom message let's say hello my name is and then i'll use a format field here so let's follow this string by using the format method and i would like to insert my name at this location so currently this will display hello my name is bro or whatever else your name is so we can add some padding either before our name after or we can add some padding to the left and the right hand side of our value that we have so what we'll do to begin is let's add some padding to the right hand side of our name that we have so within our format field if we need to add some padding within the format field add a colon and then the amount of space you would like to allocate to displaying your value so let's say 10 so i'm going to allocate 10 spaces worth of room to display my name you can't really see it right now but let's take a look so i can't move my cursor past this line at the end of my name but with my second line i have all of this room to work with so if i were to change my string that i have let's say nice to meet you well then all of this padding that i have is going to be more evident so we can add a number preceding with a colon to add some padding to a value and then you can left align this right align it or center align it so what i'll do is copy this line that i have if you need to left align it you use the less than sign but there's going to be no visible change because that's already the default if you need to write a line precede your number with a greater than sign so your value is going to be right aligned if you need to center this value then use the carrot so this will center align your value within the padding that you have allotted one question that you might have for me and i'll try and answer that now because it's relevant what if we need to add a positional argument or a keyword argument to our format field if there's already some text within here so what you would do before the colon you would just precede the colon with either your positional argument or your keyword argument followed by colon and then whatever you want to add afterwards to format your value that you have alright ladies and gentlemen we are near the end and i promise that this is the last section how can we format some numbers let's say we have a number variable and this will equal the first few digits of pi 3.14159 let's pretend that we would like to display only the first two digits after the decimal so we can do so using the format method let's print the number pi is and then i'll use a format field here and we will call the format method and insert our number that we have so if i need to display only the first two digits after the decimal within the format field i will add colon dot to f f is for floating point numbers that's anything with a decimal portion so the result is that this will display only the first two digits after my decimal because we placed two within the format field so if this was three point three f this would display three digits after the decimal portion oh and apparently this will round your number so that's something that you should keep in mind so this time let's change our number to something larger like 1000 and i will copy this line and make a few changes let's say the number is and i would like to add a comma at the thousands place so after the colon within the format field i will add a comma so this will automatically add a comma to all 1000s places another cool thing that you can do is that you can display your number as binary so within the format field add colon b this will display a binary representation of your number you can do the same thing with octal by adding colon o so our number is now being displayed as an octal number and you can do the same thing with hexadecimal lowercase x for lowercase or uppercase x for all uppercase so my number 1000 is now in hexadecimal and lastly we can display this number in scientific notation using either lowercase e for lowercase or capital e for uppercase and mynumber 1000 is now in scientific notation all right everybody so that's a few things that you can do with the format method it's an optional method that gives users more control when displaying output if you would like a copy of all the code that we've written here today i will post everything in the comments down below don't be afraid to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain a few useful methods of the random module so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay people in this video i'm going to explain how we can generate some random numbers as well as a few other useful methods of the random module now we're not going to be creating true random numbers but something called pseudorandom numbers which are fairly darn close so the first step is to import the random module at the top import random we now have access to everything that the random module has to offer let's begin by generating a random number between one and six like we're rolling a dice so what i'm going to do is say x equals random dot rand and we can generate a random integer between a certain range if i want one through six i will state one comma six and then we can generate a random number between one and six like we're rolling a dice so if i were to print the value of x then we will get a random number between one and six for example i just got a one a two a three and a six all right we can also generate a random floating point number two let's say y equals random dot random so this will give us a random number between 0 and 1. this time i'm going to print y so we have 0.49 and some change 0.145 and 0.858 we can also generate a random choice from a list or other collection let's say we're playing a game of rock paper scissors so let's create a list i'll just call this my list equals square brackets and we will have three choices rock paper and scissors so let's say z will be the random string that we generate z equals random dot choice and we will pass in my list and let's print z so this will generate a random choice from my list called my list so we got scissors paper and rock we can also use the shuffle method of the random module to shuffle a list or other collection let's say we're working with a deck of cards cards equals let's say one through nine and we have a jack a queen a king and an ace this won't be a full deck of cards it'll just be one suit so we can actually shuffle this list by using the shuffle method random dot shuffle what do we want to shuffle we want to shuffle our cards and i will display my cards with a print statement so the shuffle method will shuffle a list or other collection for you well everybody that's a few useful methods of the random module if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments down below don't be afraid to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain exception handling in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show well everyone let's talk about exceptions an exception is an event detected during execution that interrupts the normal flow of a program here's a program that i've written and we're intentionally going to cause an exception so this program that i've written we will accept a numerator and a denominator from the user we'll divide the numerator by the denominator we'll get a result and print the result so what if i were to divide a number such as 5 divided by 0 which we cannot mathematically do well this will cause an exception an event detected during execution that interrupts the flow of a program so our program was interrupted and within our console window we have this traceback message which states what went wrong and a name for this exception that occurred this specific exception that occurred is a zero division error so this video is all about handling these exceptions so they do not interrupt the normal flow of a program now a very basic form of exception handling is to surround any code that is considered dangerous as in it might cause an exception within a try block anytime you accept user input would be a good indicator too so this code is considered dangerous because we don't know what the user is going to type in so we will try all of this code if an exception occurs we can catch it and handle it so to do that we'll add an accept block accept and then we will catch exception normally having this block by itself isn't considered good practice but i'll explain why later so this accept exception block will catch all sorts of different exceptions and it will prevent our program from being interrupted and we can do something else entirely such as print a message something went wrong so let's try this again we will divide five by zero which we cannot do we no longer have that traceback message within our console window we caught the exception and we did something else we printed something went wrong like i said before it's not considered good practice to have a single accept block that will handle all exceptions it's much better to first handle specific exceptions when they occur and we can do so by writing additional accept blocks so let's create an additional accept block that will catch any zero division error exceptions that occurs when somebody attempts to divide by zero so if this exception occurs how do we want to handle it let's just print the message let's print you can't divide by zero idiot and let's try this again so five divided by zero you can't divide by zero idiot here's another one i'm going to turn this accept block into a comment so we can take a look at something what if i divide by something that's not a number like we take 5 and divide it by the word pizza well pizza is not a number and we ran into a value error exception so we should probably handle this too so let's create another accept block that will handle that accept value error and how do we want to handle this let's print something enter only numbers please okay let's try this again and see if this exception is caught five divided by the word pizza enter only numbers please not only that but you can also add the accept exception block at the very end just in case there's something you won't anticipate but it's always considered good practice to first catch any specific exceptions and let the user know exactly what went wrong an additional way in which we can handle these exceptions is that we could display the exception that occurs although it is completely optional so to do that what we'll do is that after each of these accept block definitions let's add as e so we're calling the exception as e that's just standard practice although it's not necessary so let's do that for each of these except blocks and then we can print whatever e is so let's add that to each of these blocks so it should now look something like this so when we encounter an exception we can display what exception occurred too as well so let's divide five by pizza invalid literal for int with base 10 pizza enter only numbers please so like i said this is an additional way in which you could handle an exception although it's entirely optional another thing that you can do is that you can add an else statement to the end of your accept blocks so what's happening here is that we're going to try all of this code if an exception happens then catch it and handle it if not then do something else so why don't we print our result only if there are no exceptions that occur so if there are no exceptions we will execute this else statement if not then we won't so let's divide five by an actual number this time like two so there are no exceptions that occurred so we executed this else statement whatever code is within our else block and this printed the result of 2.5 but if an exception were to occur like we divide 5 by 0 then we will catch our exception and handle it and we do not execute whatever block of code is within our else statement there is one other clause that you should be aware of that is the final clause this is always at the end how this works is that whether or not we catch an exception we will always execute any code that is within the block of code for our final clause so this is a good opportunity if you open files to close them within the finally block but we haven't dealt with opening files yet so we won't do that all we'll do is just print something print this will always execute so whether or not we encounter an exception this finally block will always execute at the end so let's try this again so this time let's cause an exception let's divide five by zero you can't divide by zero this will always execute and this time let's take this seriously and divide five by another number such as three so this will give us a result and like i said the finally clause the code within the finally clause will always execute but we won't really be working with this until we get to the section on file handling well everybody those are exceptions in python they are events detected during execution that interrupt the flow of a program and we can handle these exceptions by using try and accept blocks so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that is how exceptions work in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be covering some basic file detection using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome ladies and gentlemen to the beginning of a mini series involving doing stuff with files using python and in this video we're going to be doing some basic file detection and in order to do so i recommend importing the os module it's already included with the standard python library all you need to do is import it all we'll be doing is checking to see if a file exists someplace on our computer so we'll probably need a file to work with what i'm going to do is go to my desktop for convenience and just create a new text document i will call this test.txt now i probably need the file location so i'm going to copy that and then we can use this so let's create a variable called path that will include the path to the file that i would like to detect so that was test.txt now if you have backslashes in your file path you'll probably need double backslashes because that's the escape sequence for a backslash within a string so we now have this variable path that we can work with now i would like to check to see if this location exists on my computer so if os dot path dot exists and you can see that we can pass in our path as an argument so i will pass in my path and if this returns true if that location exists i will print that location exists so this will not tell me if this is a file or not we'll be covering that later else let's print that location doesn't exist all right so if this location exists this will return true if not this will execute our else statement that location exists so what if i were to delete this file and we run this program again that location doesn't exist now this won't tell you if the location you're dealing with is a file or not there is a separate function for that it is if os dot path dot is file what we'll do is pass in our path and print that is a file all right so let's create another file because i deleted the previous one test.txt it's in the same location let's run this again that location exists that is a file now what if this was a folder so i'm going to create a new folder i will call this folder i will delete my test document and let's change the location to folder that location exists but it is not a file you can check to see if a location is a directory so let's write an else if statement os dot path dot is directory and we will pass in our path and let's print that is a directory all right so we have our folder we're going to check to see if this location exists and if it's a file or a directory that location exists that is a directory well everyone that is the basics of file detection we'll be building upon this concept in future videos so if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that is the basics of simple file detection using python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be reading a file in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome back guys and gals in this video i'm going to explain how we can read the contents of a file using python so we'll probably need some sort of file to work with i created a plain text file called test.txt it's a plain text file and all this says is omg you can read this have a nice day like comment and subscribe so what i would like to do is to read the contents of that file line by line and print it to the console window and here's how and honestly we only need two lines of code to do this so what we'll do is type with open then within the open function list the name of your file or the file path this file of mine is within my project folder so i only need to list the file name if this was someplace else you'll probably need the file path so let's say this was on my desktop well i'll probably need to list the file path of where that file is located and i'll need to use double backslashes because that's the escape sequence for a backslash but since this file is within my project folder i only need to list the file name so with open then the name your file or the file path as file then what we're going to do is print file dot read and that is it so let's test it and it works omg you can read this have a nice day like comment and subscribe so this will actually close files automatically after opening them so that's kind of convenient and let's just test that theory so i'm going to print file dot closed if my file is in fact closed this will print true if it's still open this will print false so normally when you read a file it's normally open and you need to close it manually but if you write your program this way with open this will close the file automatically for you so using with open will close any files automatically for you after they've been opened however this does not catch and handle any exceptions that might occur like if we cannot locate this file so let's say that i mistyped the extension for this file let's say that i type in test.tx that's kind of funny because tx is the abbreviation for texas it's a texas file so this will cause a file not found error and this will interrupt the flow of our program and we would probably like to prevent that so what we could do is write a try and an accept block so we will try all of this code if we cannot find this file we can handle this exception file not found error so we'll place all of this code within the try block then if an exception happens we will catch that exception except we would like to catch any file not found air exceptions and let's handle this by printing that file was not found so if i were to run this again we will catch and handle this exception and this will not interrupt the normal flow of our program well everybody that's how to open and read a file in python if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's how to open and read a file using python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be writing files in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show so to begin it's kind of similar to the last video on reading files with open within the open function list the file name or the file path so what do you want to call this file i will call this file test dot txt now normally with the open function there is a mode and you can actually change that there's a second argument that you can pass in by default this is r for read but if you want to write a file this would be w so now we're going to write a file called test.txt so to finish with open as file what are we going to do file dot write and within the write function we can write some text so let's create a text variable and we will add a string so let's say text equals yo and if you need to go down to a new line be sure to use the new line character so after this new line character the text that comes after is going to be on the next line as if we're hitting enter so yo this is some text have a good one all right so after i run this program we should have a file a text file within our project folder that appears and it is right here and it says yo this is some text have a good one now this is in write mode if this text was something else it will actually overwrite your current file so if i were to change this to uh oh this text has been over written well then this will overwrite the text that we have uh oh this text has been overwritten so you can actually append a file by changing the mode to a for append so let me change this back we will rewrite this this will save over our current file now we can append some text so let's add maybe a new line uh have a nice day see ya so i would like to append some text to this file i'm going to change the mode to a for append and we can now append some text onto the end of this file well everybody that's how to write to a file and or append a file if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's how to write to and or append a file in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be copying files in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome back to another video regarding doing stuff with files using python and in this video we're going to be copying some files and in order to do so i recommend importing the shuttle module there's other ways of doing this too but i tend to like using the shuttle module now with this module there are three basic functions to copy a file starting at the top they are copy file copy and copy to so copy file is what we'll be working with this will copy the contents of a file copy will do everything that copy file does plus copy the permissions mode and the destination can be a directory and lastly copy 2 this will do everything that copy does plus it copies the metadata of that file including the files creation and modification times so depending on the project or the program you're working with you may need to use copy or copy too but in this video we're going to be using copy file just to copy the contents of a file now after you import the shuttle module this is all you need to do to copy a file shuttle dot then use the appropriate function that you need to copy your file we're going to be using copy file copy file and within this function there are two arguments a source and a destination so within my project folder i have a plain text file called test test.txt all this says is yo this is some text see ya what i would like to do is copy this file because it's cool now since this file is within my project folder i only have to list the file name otherwise if this is someplace else i would list the file path here so this file is test.txt this is the source file and now i need a destination so the second argument will be separated with the comma i'm going to list a destination so you can actually rename this to i would like to name this as copy.txt so the destination is my project folder so when i create a copy of this file test.txt this copy will appear in my project folder and say the same thing so after running this we now have a file named copy.txt that says the same thing as my test file and remember what i said you can copy this file to a different location on your computer so you could list the file path so this file path would go to my desktop and then when i run this this will copy my original file my source and then copy it to wherever my destination is oh and i almost forgot so if you need to use copy or copy 2 the arguments are exactly the same so if you needed to use copy this would be a shuttle dot copy instead of copy file then copy 2 is shuttle dot copy 2. the arguments are exactly the same but each of these functions will copy different things depending on what you need for your own program or project all right everybody so that's the basics of copying files and python i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that is how to copy files using python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can move files using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome back everybody to another video regarding that thing that we do called programming and in this video we're going to be moving files using python and in order to do so i recommend importing the os module this is included with the standard python library all you need to do is import it and now let's create two variables a variable called source that will hold the location of where our source file is located as well as a variable called destination to function as well the destination now for this video i'm going to move a file within my project folder to my desktop so to do so i'm going to create a new file i will name this test.txt but take the liberty to name this whatever you want so i'm going to list the location of where my test file is located since this is within my project folder i only need the file name if this was someplace else on your computer you would probably need the file path and now where would i like to move this file to i would like to move this file to my desktop so i just need the file path so i'm going to go to my desktop right click go to properties i'm going to copy this location and paste it within my destination and i will add slash desktop slash test.txt you can also rename this too if you want i will just keep it the same now if you have single backslashes you'll likely need to change these to double backslashes because that is the escape sequence to print a backslash within a string so we have a source location as well as a destination location now we can begin i would recommend writing our code within a try and accept block to handle any exceptions so i would like to handle any file not found error exceptions just in case our program cannot locate our source file so let's print a message if that is the case perhaps source plus was not found now within our try block let's check to see if there is already a file at this destination because i would not like to save over it if there's already a file there so let's do some basic file detection if os dot path dot exists and i will pass in my destination as an argument to the exists function so if there is already a file here i should probably let the user know print there is already a file there else we can replace our files honestly if you do not care about saving over any files you can omit this part so else os dot replace and we will pass in our source and our destination as arguments and let's print a message to the console window to let the user know that source plus was moved all right let's try this oh i accidentally deleted my file test.txt all right now this should disappear in three two one and it's gone test.txt was moved and it should now be on my desktop which it is now you can also use this to move a directory as well i'm going to create a new directory i will name this folder and i will change source to folder and the destination from test.txt to folder and now this should move my folder there is already a file there oh let's delete that okay folder was moved all right everybody so that is how to move a file and or directory using python if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that is how to move a file and or directory using python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can delete files using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody so in this video we're going to be deleting files using python and in order to do so i recommend importing the os module this is already included with the standard python library all you need to do is import it and now we need a file to work with so let's right click on our projects folder and go to new file i will name this test.txt and we now have a file that we can work with but you know what i would like to delete this file because it's lame so let's do that in order to delete this file let's type os dot remove and we're going to list the file path here since this file is within my project folder i only need to list the file path test.txt if this was someplace else on my computer i would probably need the file path like that but since this file is within my project folder i only need the file name another thing that you can do too at least what i like to do is that i like to pass in a variable called path i will make this a variable and assign it a string value of whatever the path to my file is so i will assign path the name to my file test.txt now when i run this this will delete my file test.txt and you can see that it's no longer there now what if we attempt to delete a file that doesn't exist well we'll encounter an exception so if you want this is optional we can do some exception handling so let's write the remove function within a try block and we will catch this exception file not found error and let's print something print that file was not found now if you attempt to delete a file that doesn't exist your program will not be interrupted and instead you'll print something that file was not found now this function does not remove empty folders this is how to do so and actually let's test that so let's create a new directory i'll call this empty underscore folder now i will attempt to delete this empty folder empty folder we encountered a permission error access is denied so let's create an accept block for that accept permission error print i don't know you do not have permission to delete that right to delete an empty folder there is a different function os dot rmdir short for remove directory we're going to list the file path and pass that in as an argument and let's create an else block as well because we can else if there are no exceptions let's print path plus was deleted all right so rmdir remove directory will delete an empty directory empty folder was deleted now this function will not delete a folder that contains files and let's try that so let's create a new directory i'll just call this folder and within this folder i will create a new file test.txt all right let's attempt to delete this folder i will probably need to change the file name let's change that to folder and we encountered an os error that directory is not empty so let's handle this exception we don't need to but i like to accept os air print you cannot delete that using that function okay to delete a folder that contains files we'll need the shuttle module import shuttle and the function that we're looking for is shuttle dot rm tree short for remove tree and we will pass in our path now be careful with this function it is considered dangerous because it will delete a directory and all files contained within so now we can delete a folder that contains files folder was deleted in conclusion these are three basic functions to delete a file or directory they are remove which deletes a file rmdir which is an abbreviation for remove directory which will delete an empty directory and lastly rmtree which is an abbreviation for remove tree and this is of the shuttle module and this will delete a directory containing files so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to delete files and or directories using python yo what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in today's video i'm going to be discussing modules in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right well welcome back we're talking about modules today a module is a file containing python code it may contain functions classes etc it's used with modular programming which is this concept of separating a program into useful different parts we're currently working within our main module and mine is named hello youtube this is how to create a separate module right click on your project folder go to new python file i think i'll create a module filled with maybe message functions so i'll call this messages and click python file all right we have two tabs one for our main module mine is called hello youtube and a separate module for messages and i can write whatever i want within here since we're using modular programming i'll place a bunch of useful functions within this module and i'll import them to the main module that we're currently working with let's define a function called hello all this will do is print hello have a nice day and i'll create a second function for good measure let's call this pie let's say bye have a wonderful time now if we would like access to this module we need to import it i will head back to my main module and at the top write this import then the name of the module and for this example we used the name of messages for our separate module and to use a function from that module type the name of the module dot and then the name of the function so messages.hello will call the hello function found within the messages module and i can also call the buy function as well messages dot bye and that will print bye have a wonderful time no it can be somewhat tedious to have to write the name the module followed by the function name what we could do to shorten things up is to give our messages module an alias also known as a nickname so at the top write import messages as and what sort of nickname should we give messages let's say msg for short so we'll replace messages with msg msg hello and msg buy and this would work the same and it involves less typing there's also an additional way of importing a module and it goes a little something like this from the name of the module import and then list all of the functions or classes you would like to import i would like to import hello comma buy and we no longer need the module name before calling one of these functions i can simply just call hello and vi directly another way in which this could be written is from messages import asterisk that means to import all and i actually would not recommend using this if you're working on a large program or something that contains many modules because you can run into a naming conflict because some of these modules may have the same named function names or variables so if you're working on a small program i really don't think it's a big deal but if you have multiple modules i would actually refrain from using import alt it's much safer to write the name of the module followed by the name of the function that you want to use now another cool thing is that python has a bunch of pre-written modules that you have access to if you would like a comprehensive list of them type help and pass in the word modules and within my console window this will populate a listing of all the modules available to us here they are let's see if math is in here yep there it is so yeah feel free to take a look through some of these modules because there are some fairly useful tools within some of these modules i suppose you can also go to python's official documentation and search for the python module index and here's a listing of all the different modules too they have access to well everyone those are modules they are files containing python code and they may contain functions classes etc if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comments section down below but yeah those are modules in python i guess there's a module called pickle hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be creating a basic game of rock paper scissors in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show let's begin by importing the random module because we're going to need the computer to pick a random choice and we'll create a list of possible choices so we have three strings within here rock paper and scissors i think i spelled scissors wrong there we go okay and we will have our computer pick a random dot choice from our list of choices and let's test it by printing whatever the computer picks so the computer picked paper paper scissors and scissors okay what about the player choice let's say player equals input rock paper or scissors and let's print what the player has print player and let's print the computer too maybe i'll add a string before these so let's say computer call in space whatever the computer chooses and same thing with the player player all right let's see if this works rock paper or scissors let's say rock the computer picks paper and i pick rock so i would technically lose this round now what if the player doesn't pick rock paper or scissors what if they type in gun so we would like some way to prevent that so let's put our input for our player within a while loop while player not in choices so we're going to need to initialize player because right now it's an unresolved reference so let's say player equals none for the time being okay now let's test our choices our player choices rock paper or scissors i pick the gun and it's going to keep on asking me until i pick something from my list of choices so if i type in that still won't accept it now let's type in rock again there we go now what if somebody types in one of these choices either all caps or capitalized well that technically wouldn't be in choices because these strings are case sensitive so why don't we take our user input and make it lowercase and i'll just add on dot lower and use the lower method so therefore we can now type in any input that is either all caps or uppercase and then that will still be accepted because we're going to take our player input and then make it lower case so that it matches one of these choices okay let's work on the win conditions next so first let's check to see if we encountered a tie if player is equal to computer that means that we both chose the same thing so let's print whatever the computer picked what we picked and we will print tie now let's write an else if statement e l i f player equals rock so if we pick rock and then we will create a nested if statement if computer equals paper that means we lose so let's print everything we have here except we're going to change tie to you lose now if the computer picks let's say scissors then we win so scissors and you win okay then let's just repeat this process for scissors and paper so this will be another else if statement if we pick scissors and the computer picks rock then we lose if the computer picks paper then you win and lastly we have paper as the player choice so else if player equals paper and the computer picks scissors then we lose if the computer picks rock well then paper covers rock and we win now let's test it rock paper or scissors again i'll try and pick the gun which i can't let's take this seriously i will pick rock the computer picked rock so it's a tie i'm feeling like paper today oh it's another tie i guess and how about scissors okay so i win this round i picked uh scissors and the computer picked paper therefore i win let's try and lose this time just to verify it so i won again let's try rock again okay so i lost that round so we know that the win conditions are working now how about we add a feature where we will ask the player if they would like to play again play another round i think the best way to do that would be to write all of this code within a while loop so at the top let's write while true and we'll need to indent everything so that it's within the while loop so let's just indent everything here now at the bottom we will ask the user if they would like to play again and i will store this within a variable named play again play again equals input and the prompt will be play again yes slash no and depending on their input let's just make it all lower case if play again does not equal yes that means they would like to quit so let's use a break statement to break out of our while loop that we're in and at the end let's print by and pay attention to the indentation this input and this if statement should be within the while loop so they should have at least one indentation and our print statement here we'll just say bye and you can see that there is no indentation so that is outside of the while loop okay let's test this one last time rock paper scissors i'm going to pick the cannon okay that's not valid input how about rock okay the computer picks rock i pick rock so it's a tie do i want to play again i'm going to select actually yes all caps that should still be acceptable elbow paper this time it's a tie again man the computer is really good at this game i'd like to play again i'll pick scissors okay so i lose i would like to play again and i want to win this time okay computer pick scissors i pick rock you win do you want to play again nah and it will print bye well everybody that's a simple game of rock paper scissors i'll post all of this code to the comment section down below and well yeah that's a basic game of rock paper scissors in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you guys how we can build a basic quiz game in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show to begin this project i think it would be wise for us to create a skeletal structure for how this program is going to operate and then we'll fill in the gaps later as we go along so to begin let's define all of the functions that we'll need we'll need four we'll create a function that is named new game whenever we call this function it will create a new quiz game for us and for the time being let's write pass just as a placeholder we'll have a total of four functions new game a function to check our answer a function to display our score and lastly a function to play again all right now i'm just going to add some comments here just to separate each of these functions that we have just so that it's a little bit easier to read although this part is not really necessary so i just want to separate each of these functions for some readability okay those are all the functions that we'll need what we'll need now is some sort of collection to hold all of the questions and answers that we have and i think a dictionary would be perfect for this so what i did is that i created a dictionary named questions a dictionary has key value pairs each key is a question that i would like to ask and each question has an associated value we'll have the user guess between answers of a b c or d so these would be all of the correct answers all of the values within this dictionary so here are some of the questions that i want to ask feel free to come up with your own questions if you would like you can copy the questions that i have they should be posted in the comment section down below so the questions that i'm going to ask are who created python what year was python created python is attributed to which comedy group and lastly is the earth round i couldn't think of a fourth question so i just threw in a random stupid question and the correct answers to all of these questions in order would be a b c and a but feel free to come up with your own well we have our questions but we'll need some sort of collection to hold all of the different possible answers to each of these questions and i think a 2d list would work perfect for this so i have a list of lists a list of tuples could work too i suppose so here are all of the answers for the first question and the correct answer is a i believe his name is guido van rossum hey if you're listening man i'm sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name i'm really trying here the second list corresponds to the second question what year was python created it was created in 1991 at least according to wikipedia python is attributed to which comedy group the answer is c monty python like monty python and the holy grail good movie by the way and lastly is the earth round this is a highly debated topic but the answer is hey the earth is in fact round so i have a list of lists each list corresponds to a key value pair within my dictionary of questions and this is a lot to type if you want you can just copy the code that i posted in the comments down below just copy and paste and you'll have all of this or if you want you can pause the video and type it i don't care so now that you have your questions and your options we're ready to begin so the first thing that we'll do within our program is to call the new game function to begin a new game so after we have our questions and options created let's create a new game by calling the new game function now when we run this program we'll generate our dictionary of questions and our 2d list of different options for each question and then we will call the new game function to begin a new game so let's head to the new game function and fill in everything within our new game function so at the top let's declare a few things let's say we have a list named guesses and guesses will be an empty list for now i will declare a variable called correct guesses set it equal to zero because we haven't guessed anything yet and we will set a current question number and set the sequel to one to represent the first question okay now we need to display all of the questions within our dictionary of questions and we can use a for loop for that so for key in questions i'm going to print my key and let's just test this okay yeah here's all my questions i think what i'll do is actually print something to separate each question let's say one of these lines i think it would look better with them okay i'll print this line and then we'll move on to a question all right now after re-running this we have each question and i added just a line break between each of these to make it look kind of fancy now i need to display all of the different options for each question and we can do that with a nested for loop so if i were to write i in options print i let me show you what happens now with the way this for loop is written now it's going to display all of the different options available to us for the entire quiz game what i would like instead is to display only the first list for the first question and then the second list for the second question and follow that pattern so we're going to change our for loop around 4i in options and we'll set an index for options the index is going to be our question number minus one now remember what i said in previous videos where different collections including lists tuples etc the first element in a collection has an index of zero because computers always start with zero then the next element would therefore have an index of one then two three then you follow that pattern we're using this question number variable as some sort of counter and since we initially set this to one i'm just going to subtract one so that we effectively receive zero as the index and now we just need to increment our question number after each iteration so let's do that i will add that to the end here after we finish displaying all of the options let's increment question number by one by typing question num plus equals one and if i were to run this currently we'll display all of the different options for each question who created python here's all of the associated options what year is python created python is attributed to which comedy group and lastly is the earth round now it's time for some user input so i'm going to create a variable called guess and make sure you don't put it within your inner for loop it should be within the outer for loop guess equals input and i'll create a prompt enter a b c or d here's something to consider we would like the user to type in either capital a b c or d with strings they're case sensitive what if the user typed in one of these letters but lowercase if they're correct we would still like to give them their point why don't we take our guess and make it uppercase so guess equals guess and we can make this uppercase using the upper method of strings at the end of this game i'm going to compare our guesses to the correct answers so we have an empty list named guesses and i'm going to append our current guest that we're working on to our list of guesses so guesses dot append and we will append our guess this round now that we have our guess and we've appended our guess to our list of guesses let's check to see if it's the correct answer or not so we're just about to fill in this check answer function next so we are going to call this function and pass in a few items as arguments so let's use the check answer function and we'll pass in the key for the current question that we're on so the key is the correct answer so that would be our questions dot get key this would be the answer and we'll also pass in our guess and we are going to fill in the check answer function but we need to set up the parameters we're receiving effectively our answer as well as our guess so i'm going to name these as answer and guess and we are going to check to see if our answer is equal to our guess if answer is equal to guess let's print something print correct and i think we should give the user a point we'll have our check answer function return one for one point return one else if this is not the correct answer let's print wrong and we will return zero they do not get a point and since this is returning a value we should assign that so let's assign the point we may or may not receive to our variable of correct guesses which is initially set to zero so we'll type correct guesses plus equals check answer and check answer will return one if we scored a point or zero if we did not score a point and make sure you have plus equals because if you just set this to equals then we cannot score more than one point it will either be zero or one so we are effectively incrementing our correct guesses by one for each point that we score and now we're going to work on the display score function and we'll call that at the end after we finish all of our questions that we have so make sure that you do not write this within the for loop it should be outside of it because once we finish iterating through all of our questions we're going to display a final score so let's call the display score function and we'll need to pass in some arguments our correct guesses as well as our list of guesses okay let's head to the display score function so we have as parameters correct guesses as well as guesses i need to remove this pass i'm going to add one of these fancy lines in just to separate the questions from the results and i will print results and maybe another one of these lines okay so i need to print all of the answers answers and i do not want to end on a new line so i'm going to set end equal to nothing and i need to display all of the values within our dictionary all of the answers i will do that using a for loop for i in questions print questions dot get i and i do not want to end on a new line so i'm going to set end equal to nothing effectively and then i'll print a new line okay let's work on the guesses i think i'm just going to copy all this and make some changes i'll replace answers with guesses for i in guesses print i okay let's just be sure that everything's working we're not calculating a score quite yet so i'm just going to answer a then b c and d on second thought after printing each of these answers and guesses i'm going to add a space after each of these so within each of these four loops at the end i will add a space let me try that again a b c d okay not too bad now let's calculate the final score and we're still within our display score function let's set score equal to correct guesses divided by the length of our questions and let me add a set of parentheses around here then i'm going to multiply our score by 100 and if you don't want a decimal portion because we'll display a percentage we can cast this as an end okay that all looks good and we'll print the final score print your score is plus we need to cast our score to a string because we're using string concatenation plus i'll add a percent sign all right let's try it i'm intentionally going to get the last question wrong so we should have a 75 if we have four questions so that would be a b c is the earth round what's earth i'm gonna guess d answers a b c a your guess is a b c d your score is 75 okay let's test it but getting all wrong answers d d d d your score is zero percent congratulations and we'll test it one more time but get all the right answers we just want to be sure that we have 100 that's a b c a your score is 100 now the last thing that you can add is that we can play again if we want and i have a separate function for that if you would like to add this option here's how to do so let's remove that pass let's set a variable named response equal to some input do you want to play again let's ask for yes or no actually let me remove that okay and depending on the user's response it might be a lowercase so let's make it uppercase response equals response and use the upper method if response is equal to yes all caps if response is equal to yes then return true else we will return false and that is it for this function the last thing we need to do is to create a while loop that will continue to ask the player if they want to play again this will be after we call the new game function while play again and remember this will return either true or false depending on the user's response while play again new game and call the new game function to create a new game for us if we escape the while loop that means the user doesn't want to play again so let's print the message such as by e all right let's test it i'm going to get all of the correct answers this time a b c a all right your score is 100 do you want to play again i'm going to type yes all right then we can play again d d d d your score is zero percent do you want to play again no i think i mastered this game bye all right everybody so that's how you can use python to create a simple quiz game i will post all of this code to the comment section down below but well yeah that's a basic quiz game in python for you all hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain object-oriented programming in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome to today's topic on python object oriented programming also known as pop and in today's video we're going to be creating objects an object is an instance of a class by using programming we can create representations of real-life objects so look around you wherever you're sitting or standing right now you are surrounded by objects next to me i have a phone a television some snacks and i'm talking into a microphone point being we can use programming to mimic real world objects by assigning a combination of attributes what an object is or has and methods what an object can do now in order to create an object we'll need to create a class a class can function as a blueprint that will describe what attributes and methods that our distinct type of object will have you can either create your class within your main module or you could create a separate file dedicated solely for your class now to create a class we would type class and then the name of the object that we would like to create so today i would like to create some car objects because i like cars so we would type car and a common naming convention with class names is that they should be capital so car is going to have a capital c and for the time being we need to type in something i'll just type in pass as a placeholder so if you have a small program it may be better to write your class within your main module but if your class is fairly large you may want to consider placing your class within a separate module so if you were to take that route we would go to file new python file and we would name this car click python file and we would declare our class within the separate module so class car and for now i'll type in pass then we just need to import this class so within our main module we would type from the name of the module import the name of the class from car import car now objects can have some combination of attributes and methods attributes describe what an object is or has so what are a few attributes that cars might have they might have a make so let's create a few variables for the time being i'm just going to use none as a placeholder cars can have a model a year and a color now objects can also have methods what kinds of methods could cars perform perhaps a drive method and a stop method so let's define those def let's say drive and we'll have one argument self self refers to the object that is using this method now what do we want to do when we call this method let's say this car is driving let's create a stop method as well def stop and we will print this car is stopped we now have all of the different attributes and methods we would like our car objects to have but there is one more thing that we need it is a special method called the init method that will construct objects for us in other programming languages this is known as the constructor so we need a special method that will create objects for us so we need to define this method def and the syntax on this is somewhat strange it is two underscores init it's short for initialize 200 scores again and then we need at least self as an argument and then we can actually assign our car objects unique variables so take all of these attributes that we have and we're going to place them within this init method now we can receive arguments when we create car objects but we need to pass them in as arguments to our init method so we need to set up some parameters let's say in order to create a car object we need a make a model a year and a color then when we receive these arguments we can actually assign them to each car's specific attributes but we need to precede each of these with self self is referring to the object that we're currently working on or creating so self.make self.model self.ear and self.color and then when we assign these we're going to say self.make equals whatever make that we receive when it's passed in as an argument self.model equals model and continue that pattern for year and color all right that is all we need for our class car we have a constructor we're assigning arguments that we receive to the attributes of our car object and we also have two methods one for drive and one for stop now we can start creating some car objects so going back to my main file here to create an object we need a unique name for it let's call this first car just car one equals the name of the class car then a set of parentheses now in order to construct a car object we need to pass in a matching set of arguments you can see here that we need to pass in a make a model a year and a color so what kind of car should we make let's say that the make is going to be chevy we need a model perhaps corvette a year 2021 is good and a color let's say blue alright now let's actually access some of these cars attributes and i should probably put this one in a print statement so print car ones make and this should print chevy then we can do the same thing for model year and color so let's change some of these around model year and color yep this object is a chevy corvette 2021 and the color is blue and we should have two methods as well so car one i would like this car to use its drive method this car is driving and let's have this car use it stop method car one dot stop this car is stopped there's one thing that i should mention real quick because i forgot to mention it earlier so within our init method you can see that we need five arguments in order to construct a car object self make model year in color but when we pass in our arguments we're not passing in anything for self we only have four arguments here that's because with python we do not need to pass itself that's done automatically for us we're referring to the object that we're dealing with as you can see with our drive and stop method we need to pass in self in order to execute our method but when we call this method we do not need to do so so just remember with python with self we do not need to pass in anything for this argument that is all now the nice thing about this is that we can reuse this class as a blueprint to create more car objects we just call that init method that constructor so this time let's create a second car called car 2 and this will be a different kind of car what kinds of arguments should we pass it let's say this is a ford mustang the year will be 2022 and the color will be red all right let's check card to use attributes and let's have car 2 use its drive and stop method this is a ford mustang the year is 2022 the color is red this car is driving and this car is stopped one other thing that we can do too is that within our methods here let's replace car with the name of the model that we're working with so this plus self dot model plus is driving now this self keyword think of it as you're replacing self with the name of the object that we're working on if car one is using its drive method replace itself with car one if this is car two that called this method then replace itself with car 2. think of it that way and let's do the same thing for stop this plus self dot model plus is stopped all right probably don't need these anymore so let's have car one use its drive and stop method this corvette is driving this corvette is stopped let's try this with car two this mustang is driving this mustang is stopped now you can have them do things independently too let's have car 1 use its drive method and car 2 uses stop method this corvette is driving and this mustang is stopped in conclusion a class can function as a blueprint to create objects we can assign attributes what describe an object is or has and methods what each object can do and then within our class we have a special method called the init method we can pass in some arguments and assign these arguments to each object's attributes and then we can reuse this class as if it was a blueprint so we can create more objects out of it so that is the basics of object oriented programming in python if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's the basics of object oriented programming in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the basics of class variables in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show here's a super quick video on the differences between class and instance variables for this example let's say we have two car objects named car one and car two and i'm just passing in a bunch of values to each of these car constructors now within my class car i have my init method also known as the constructor and what i'm doing is assigning all of these values to the variables found within my car constructor these variables declared inside the constructor are known as instance variables and each object can have their own unique values assigned to each of these variables now where a class variable is different is that a class variable is declared inside the class but outside of the constructor and what we can do is set some default values for some variables let's say we would like to add an additional variable let's say wheels wheels equals and we can set a default value for all instances of this class for each car object that we create so we set wheels to equal four this is an example of a class variable whenever we create a car object we can pass in a unique make model year in color but by default they will all have four wheels now if i was to print the amount of wheels that car 1 and car 2 have they will both have four wheels it's as if we're setting a default value if i change this to two wheels well then these cars have two wheels maybe their motorcycles or something now you can actually change these values each object will have their own copy of this variable but you can set it to a default value so let's say car one is a motorcycle car one dot wheels equals two so if i were to print car one's wheels along with card two car one will have two wheels but car two is still using that default amount of wheels which is four now there's another way in which you can access a class variable you don't necessarily need to create an object to do so you can just use the name of the class so what i'm going to do is turn all of these lines into comments and i will print the amount of wheels that our class has so type in the name of the class car with a capital c it should be the same name as your class name followed by the name of the class variable car dot wheels but make sure you spell it right all right so this will display four wheels now what if we decide to change the class variable through our class well that will affect all instances of our class so let's say car dot wheels equals two it's as if we change our mind and we have decided to create motorcycles instead of cars well if we were to change the wheels class variable through the use of our car class well then it's going to affect it for all instances of this class you can see that both car 1 and car 2 now have two wheels when we just changed car 1's wheels it did not affect car 2 at all so that's the main difference between a class variable and an instance variable an instance variable is declared inside of constructor and they can be given unique values with class variables they are declared within a class but outside of the constructor and you can set a default value for all instances of this class for all unique objects that are created and then you can change those values later too so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that is the basics of class variables in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain inheritance in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show let's talk about irritants the term inherit means to receive derive or be left with and we can apply this concept to programming classes can inherit something usually attributes and methods from another class these classes can form parent-child relationships where a child will receive everything that the parent class has much like you inherit jeans from your parents and classes can have children and give whatever they own to their children and in today's video we'll be creating a parent class called animal and children of the animal class will inherit the common attributes and methods that all animals might have to kick off this video i think what we'll do is keep all of our classes within the same file just so that it's easier for us to read and understand let's begin by creating a class called animal so at the top type class animal and what are some attributes and methods that all animals should have let's say we have a class variable called alive and we'll set this to true if you're an animal you begin by being alive and what are some methods how about an eat and sleep method so let's define those def eat what are we gonna do when we call this method let's print something let's print this animal is eating let's also create a sleep method def sleep what are we gonna do when we call this method let's print something as well this animal is sleeping and we now have our animal class now let's create separate classes for specific types of animals let's say a class for rabbit a fish and a hawk so we can make objects of those classes so let's begin with a rabbit class class rabbit now to use inheritance with the class that you intend to be the child class after the class name add a set of parentheses and then pass in the name of the parent class in this case it's going to be animal so we will add that to the parentheses so now rabbit is the child class and animal is the parent class so the child class is going to inherit everything that the animal class has so for the time being i'm going to type pass so this rabbit class will have access to a class variable called alive and an eat and sleep method so let's define a fish and hawk class and i'm just going to copy what i have here and just change rabbit to fish and then do so again and change rabbit to hawk this is our family tree animal is the parent class and it has three children a rabbit class a fish class and a hot class and for the time being we're just going to write pass as a placeholder so i bet we can create objects from these classes so let's do so let's say we have an object called rabbit rabbit equals rabbit let's do the same thing for fish and hawk all right we now have three objects rabbit fish and hawk and let's take a look at their class variables i bet they have an alive variable let's check that so i would like to print rabbit dot oh would you look at that this rabbit class has a class variable called alive even though there's nothing within this class well that's because we used inheritance so each of these three children classes inherit everything from their parents all of these attributes and methods i bet they have eaten sleep functions as well so let's check that with fish let's have fish use its eat method and hawk will use its sleep method hawk dot sleep so the rabbit is alive the fish is eating and the hawk is sleeping now even though we have nothing written within each of these specific types of animal classes all of these animals have access to these attributes and methods because of inheritance and another benefit of inheritance is that we don't need to keep on copying and pasting this code for example let's say we were not using inheritance so we would not need an animal class we could write our code this way where we would just copy and paste everything underneath each of our classes so what if we need to make a change to one of these methods as in your boss says you know what let's change sleep to slumber okay well we would have to go to each of these classes and make the change manually it's not too bad if you have like three classes but what if you have hundreds that's going to take a lot of effort so wouldn't it be nice if we just list everything that each of these classes has in common and then have all of these classes inherit from one common class and then if you need to make any changes you can do so just within this class and this change will apply to all of the different child classes so that's another benefit of inheritance and not only does it make any changes easier but each class can have their own unique attributes and methods as well along with the attributes and methods that they inherit from their parents so for rabbit fish and hawk let's have each of these classes have their own unique method as well so for rabbit let's define a run method if you're a rabbit then you can run so let's print this rabbit is running and i'm just going to fix some of the spacing here all right if you're a fish then you can swim def swim let's print this fish is swimming and lastly we have hawk if you're a hawk then you can fly def fly let's print this hawk is flying like i said before not only do these specific types of animals have access to all of the attributes and methods that they inherit from their parents but they can have their own attributes and methods as well so let's test some of these methods so we have our rabbit fish and hawk objects let's have rabbit use its run method fish we'll use its swim method and hawk will use its fly method and here we go this rabbit is running this fish is swimming and this hawk is flying so in conclusion classes can have children the children classes will inherit everything that their parent class has all of the parents attributes and methods but not only that the children classes can implement their own unique attributes and methods as well so that is inheritance if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that's the basics of inheritance using python yo what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how multi-level inheritance works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right welcome back everybody let's talk about multi-level inheritance this is a concept where a derived class also known as a child class inherits from another derived class here's an example let's say we have a hierarchy of classes there will be three levels to this we'll create a family tree of living organisms so at the very top we're going to have a class called organism any class that inherits from the organism parent class will receive one attribute one variable named alive and this will be set to true so if you are an organism you begin by being alive now let's say we have a child class that will inherit from the organism parent class let's say animal class animal inherits from organism so any animal that we create will have this alive attribute set the true and all animals eat so let's define a function that does that at least i believe all animals eat let's pretend that they do so this animal is eating and now why stop there let's create a class for a specific type of animal i like dogs so let's create a dog class class dog inherits from the animal class and all dogs should be able to bark so let's create a function to do that and we'll print this dog is barking okay so what we just did here is multi-level inheritance we had a derived child class inherit from another child class so it's kind of like this dog class is the child animal class is the parent and then the parent of the parent class would be like a grandparent right and then if you added another layer on top of that to this hierarchy well then the parent of the grandparent would be like a great grandparent that's how i think of it at least now let's create a dog object just to verify that everything's working so let's call our dog dog and our dog object should have access to an attribute named alive and our dog object receives that attribute from the organism class and this will print true if i were to print whatever this attribute contains and our dog should be able to eat because it receives this method from the animal parent class and lastly our dog should be able to bark and that method is defined within its own class so that's how multi-level inheritance works it's a concept where a child class will inherit from another child class i like to think of it like a family tree where a child class will have a parent and the parent of that parent would be like a grandparent basically so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how multi-level inheritance works in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how multiple inheritance works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people multiple inheritance multiple inheritance is the concept where a child class is derived from more than one parent class here's an example let's say that all of our children classes are going to be certain types of animals and we would like our animal classes to inherit from either the prepared class the predator parrot class or both depending on what type of animal it is because some animals in the animal kingdom can be both prey and predators and one example that comes to mind would be fish fish will eat smaller fish but also can get eaten by larger fish so here we have two classes prey and predator each has a dedicated method if a class inherits from the prey parent class they will have access to a flea method which will print this animal please if a class inherits from the predator parent class that class will have access to a hunt method that will print this animal is hunting and it's possible that some animals can do both they can both flee and hunt but they'll need to inherit both of these classes both prey and predator and that's where multiple inheritance comes in now let's create some classes based on certain types of animals let's say we have class rabbit and rabbit we'll inherit from the prey class because rabbits are typically prey and not predators but i don't know there could be some killer rabbits out there haven't run into any yet let's have class hawk inherit from the predator class and lastly fish and fish can be both prey and predators so they will inherit from both classes and we just separate each class with a comma so prey comma predator and it's as simple as that now let's create an object from each of these classes we have rabbit equals rabbit hawk equals hawk and fish equals fish now let's just verify all of the different methods that each of these objects inherited so our rabbit should have access to a flea method but no hunt method and let's just test that yep this animal flees and my hawk object should have access to a hunt method but no flea method this animal is hunting and lastly my fish object has access to both a flea and a hunt method and if you take a look on the right hand side of this pop-up window it shows the class that it inherited this method from so fleet comes from the parent class of prey and hunt comes from the apparent class of predator so my fish can both flee and hunt because it's typically considered both prey and predators this animal flees this animal is hunting so that's basically what multiple inheritance is it's a concept where a child class is derived from more than one parent class so that's basically multiple inheritance i'll post all of this code to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how multiple inheritance works in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about method overriding in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show here's a super quick video on method overriding i have two classes a class called animal and a class called rabbit rabbit inherits from the animal class therefore rabbit is the child class an animal is the parent class within the animal class there is one method a method called eat and when you call this method all this will do is print this animal is eating the rabbit class inherits from the animal class therefore rabbit has access to this eat method and if i were to create a rabbit object and this rabbit used its eat method well then this is going to print this animal is eating now method of writing is the ability of an object oriented programming language to allow a subclass also known as a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its parents in this case we're going to override the eat method and what we can do is provide a more specific implementation for the rabbit class and now to override a method what we'll do is that within the child class we need to define a method with the same matching method signature that is the combination of a method's name plus its parameters both of these together are known as a method signature within the child class we will define and eat method with the same parameters def eat and in this case the only parameter is self just to keep this simple and what we'll do is that will provide a more specific implementation of the eat method specifically for rabbits so let's print something more closely associated with rabbits such as this rabbit is eating a carrot now if i were to run this program again we will instead use this implementation of the method instead of the one that it inherits from its parent class of animal basically speaking an object will use a method that is more closely associated with itself first before relying on a method that it may inherit from a parent class in this example we're using this version of the eat method specifically for rabbits instead of the version that we inherit from the parent class of animal that is the basics of method overriding i will post this code in the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to override a method using python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about method chaining in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody let's talk about method training method chaining is used to call multiple methods sequentially and each call performs an action on the same object and return self here's an example of how method chaining would be useful let's say we have a class named car car has four methods turn on drive break and turn off they will all just print a simple message beginning with turn on turn on what print you start the engine drive will print you drive the car brake will print you step on the brakes and turn off will print you turn off the engine let's say we have a car object car equals car and i would like my car object to use its turn on method immediately followed by the drive method with how we've been coding things previously we may write something such as the name of the object in this case car dot and then the method to use i would like my card to use the turn on method followed by car dot drive so currently this will take two lines of code but this will print you start the engine and you drive the car now with method training we can call multiple methods sequentially now the format on this is going to be a little bit different and if we were to write the same code using method chaining it might look a little something like this after the first method call we would add dot and then an additional method that we would like to call so for example after the turn on method we'll immediately call the drive method but there's one more thing that we need to add when we're using python to do method training so normally this by itself will not work when we call a method in python if there is nothing that is returned python will return none so as you can see here attribute error none type object has no attribute of drive so we need to return itself under each method that we're using method training with so let's add return self to each of these methods so let's do that for drive break and the turn off method and this should work now you start the engine you drive the car so think of it like this after we finish calling this method python is going to return self so it's going to return car so then we'll immediately use car.drive now here's another example let's say i would like to call the break method followed by the turn off method so that would be car dot break parentheses followed by dot turn off so this will print you step on the brakes you turn off the engine now here's an extreme example let's say we would like to call all four methods in order so that would be car dot turn on followed by dot drive dot break dot turn off so this will call all four methods in order starting with the leftmost method you start the engine you drive the car you step on the brakes you turn off the engine now if you have one long method chain like this it might become difficult to read after a while so what i would recommend if you're doing a lot of method chaining is that after each method call just hit enter to move each method call down to a new line so it'll look something like that and this backslash might be inserted this is a line continuation character so this is a little more readable but you know it still does the same thing basically all right everybody so that is method training it's used to call multiple methods sequentially and each call performs an action on the same object and returns self if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to do a method chaining in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the super function in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show well then since you clicked on this video i should probably discuss the super function now the super function is used to give access to the methods of a parent class it returns a temporary object of a parent class when used here's an example of why the super function would be useful let's take this program that i've written there's three classes a class called rectangle which is the parent class to two children classes square and cube and all we're doing is creating a square object and a cube object but we need to pass in a length and a width for squares and a length width and height for cubes now with programming we don't like to repeat code we like to reuse code and if you take a look within my knit methods for both square and cube we're repeating self.length equals length and self.width equals width twice for our init methods so one thing that we can do any similarities between the square and cube class we can place within the rectangle class and then reuse this code so what i'm going to do is copy this indent method within our square class and paste it within our rectangle parent class and then in order to access this init method we can use the super function so we no longer need these two lines of code what i'm going to do is ask the rectangle class to use its init method so we're going to type super parentheses dot and then the name or the function of the parent class that we would like to use and i would like to use the init method but i need to send a length and a width because it requires that so let's send these so we're going to pass in our length and our width and now we can do the same thing for our cube init method so i will copy this line of code we no longer need these two lines of code because we will be reusing our init method within the parent class of rectangle but we'll still need to keep this line in to assign the height because that's a difference between our square and cube class and now we can just reuse this init method within the rectangle parent class now i'm thinking that we should probably test to see if length and width are assigned to these attributes and one way that i think would be fun would be to create an area method for squares and a volume method for cubes so let's define an area method within the square class def area and i would like to return self dot length times self dot width and we can create a volume method within cubes so let's do that def let's change this to volume we'll multiply it length times width times height but we need to type self dot pipe and we can call these methods to get the area of a square or the volume of a cube let's print square dot area and then cube dot volume so if our init method is actually being used we should have a length and the width assigned to these attributes and it looks like we do in conclusion the super function is used to give access to the methods of a parent class it returns a temporary object of a parent class when used in order to access the methods of the parent class also known as a super class and in this example within the init methods of both square and cube we immediately called the init method of the parent class to pass in some arguments that both of these classes have in common so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that is how the super function works in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how abstract classes work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey what's good everybody let's talk about abstract classes now abstract classes prevent a user from creating an object of that class think of an abstract class more as a template it's an idea it's not real it's like a ghost class basically plus an abstract class compels a user to override any abstract methods within a child class so it's also a form of checks and balances as well which we'll discuss later now here's a small program that i've written let's say we have three classes class vehicle car and motorcycle car and motorcycle are the children classes of the vehicle class now within this vehicle class we have a go method but i'm currently only defining it not actually implementing it so i'm just writing pass now within car and motorcycle we're overriding this method and creating our own implementation of the skull method that we inherit the go method for the car will print you drive the car and the go method for the motorcycle class will print you ride the motorcycle now currently i'm creating an object of each of these classes i have a generic vehicle object car object and motorcycle object now after running this program currently the go method within our vehicle class is not being implemented so this won't print anything but the go method within our car class will print you drive the car and the go method within our motorcycle class will print you ride the motorcycle with that being said let's pretend that we're coding the next need for speed game and we would like a user to create an object from a specific kind of vehicle whether it's a car from the car class or a motorcycle from the motorcycle class we would like to prevent a user from creating an object of the vehicle class because the vehicle class is too generic we do not have all of the implementations set up for a vehicle it would be like somebody unlocked the ghost car or the invisible car which doesn't actually exist and is missing a lot of features we need a user to create an object from a child class because these are fully fleshed out and one way in which we can prevent a user from creating an object of this class as well to turn this class into an abstract class which is what this video is all about go figure now the first step to creating an abstract class is that we'll need some imports so at the top of your program write this from abc abc is an acronym for abstract based class abc from abc import abc all capital comma abstract method all right now with our vehicle class the class that you intend to be the abstract class add us out of parentheses and our vehicle class will inherit from the abc class and now with any methods within your vehicle class you're going to add this decorator at the top at abstract method all right we should now be prevented from creating a vehicle object our vehicle class is now an abstract class and we cannot give it a physical form a physical manifestation and if we attempt to you can see here that we have a type error can't instantiate abstract class from vehicle with abstract methods go so an abstract class is a class which contains one or more abstract methods and an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation now by definition an abstract class contains one or more abstract methods if i remove this one abstract method within our vehicle class well we could still create a vehicle object and i'm just going to turn this vehicle.go line into a comment because we don't have a go method anymore as you can see we can still create a vehicle object which we would like to prevent a user from doing so we need at least one abstract method within our vehicle class so i'm going to go ahead and add this go method back in an additional feature of abstract classes is that they compel a user to override any abstract methods within a child class a method that is abstract has a declaration but does not have an implementation so let's say that we create our vehicle class our abstract vehicle class and now we're creating the children classes of car and motorcycle and let's say i'm not paying attention and i forget to add a go method so if i just write pass within my motorcycle class i'm currently missing a go method within my motorcycle class well python is going to prevent me from running this because we have a type air can't instantiate abstract class vehicle with abstract methods of go so by inheriting from an abstract class it's a good form of checks and balances to be sure that your children classes are not missing any implementations of any methods that they inherit here's an additional way of thinking of this our vehicle class is telling its children if you're going to inherit from me then you need to override this abstract method of mine and if you don't well i'm not going to let you be instantiated so in order for us to create a cart and motorcycle class we need to override the go method that they inherit from its parent class of vehicle and provide its own implementation now let's say we create an additional method let's say we have a stop method so let's define that def stop for the time being i'll write pass and to make this an abstract method add this decorator at abstract method now car and motorcycle both need to implement that method of stop it's currently missing it as you can see here class car must implement all abstract methods and the same thing applies for a motorcycle as well so we need to override this method and provide its own implementation so let's remove that decorator and let's print something let's print this car is stopped and i'll do the same thing for motorcycle so def stop let's say this motorcycle is stopped and we'll call the stop method for each of these types of vehicles car dot stop and motorcycle dot stop all right and we can now create a car and motorcycle object because we are overriding both of these abstract methods found within the parent class of vehicle all right everybody so that's the basics of abstract classes it's a class which contains one or more abstract methods and an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation and the benefits of using an abstract class is that they prevent a user from creating an object of that class plus it compels a user to override any abstract methods found within a child class so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how abstract classes work in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can pass objects as arguments so sit back relax and enjoy the show ladies and gentlemen in today's video i'm going to be demonstrating how we can pass objects as arguments for this example let's say we have a class car and there is one class variable called color color equals none what we'll be doing is calling a function that accepts an object as an argument as well as a color so let's create a function named change color now make sure when you define this function it's not within the cart class then technically this would be a method of the car class what we would like is a separate function outside of the car class now we need to set up some parameters we would like to accept a car object as well as a color so for the first parameter let's say a car and make sure this is in uppercase or capital because python doesn't like that argument names should be lowercase so when we pass in a car we will give it a nickname of car and we would also like to pass in a color so let's set up a parameter called color now when we pass in a car we will assign that car's color with whatever color that we receive so car dot color equals color and now let's create some car objects so let's say car one equals car car two equals car and car three equals cart currently if i were to print their colors this is what we'll see print car one dot color and repeat the steps for two and three and we're not calling this function yet so all of these colors should be set to none they are basically cars with no color they're i don't know iron or something whatever cars are made out of aluminum plastic stuff like that okay so now let's call this function change color perhaps right here so in order to call this function we need to pass in a car object as well as a color so let's pass in car one and a color perhaps red and we'll repeat the steps for two and three so let's say car two will be white and car 3 will be blue now after calling this function we have a car object and a color and we're assigning the color of our car to whatever color that we receive now these cars in order car 1 2 and 3 are red white and blue now one thing that you should know is that the name of this parameter that accepts our object doesn't necessarily need the same name as the class name that created the object that we're passing in we could name this something else entirely perhaps vehicle you'll just want to be sure that this is at least descriptive of the kind of object that you would like to pass in and we're not limited to just passing in car objects we can pass in all sorts of objects but we need to pass in an object as well as a color so this time let's create a class called motorcycle class motorcycle and this class will also have a color set to none so what we're doing is actually reusing this function for all sorts of different kinds of vehicles now let's create a vehicle i'll just name this bike one for short bike one equals motorcycle now let's call the change color function and we can pass in an object as well as color this time we will pass in our bike object as well as a color i think black counts as a color and let's print bike once color and this should work we have red white blue and black in conclusion we can pass objects as arguments to a function much like what we've been doing with variables however the type of objects that we pass in may be limited based on the required attributes and methods that that given class or object might have and we'll get more into this on the next video on duct typing so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that is how to pass objects as arguments using python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain duck typing in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show i hope you all like ducks because that's the topic of this video duct typing is the concept where the class of an object is less important than the methods and or attributes that that class might have the class type is not checked if the minimum methods and or attributes are present it's based off of a popular phrase if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck then it must be a duck here's an example i have two classes class duck and class chicken both duck and chicken have walk and talk methods but they print something different with the duck class the walk method will print this duck is walking and the duck talk method will print this duck is quacking the chicken class has the same named methods walk and talk but they print something slightly different a slightly different variation the print method will print this chicken is walking and the talk method will print this chicken is clucking now let's say we have a third class a class called person now there is one method within our person class let's say we're attempting to catch a duck we'll pass in self and we need to pass in a duck object as an argument so let's type duck now within this method we'll have our duck use its walk method as well as its talk method duck.walk and duck.talk and then maybe we'll print something such as you caught the critter now let's create an object from each of these classes let's create a duck object duck equals duck a chicken object chicken equals chicken and lastly person person equals person now if we would like our person to use the catch method we need to pass in a duck as an argument so with our person let's type person dot catch and we need to send a duck object because that's a required parameter here so we're passing in our duck object that we created and as soon as we catch the duck it's going to use its walk and talk method and then we'll print you caught the critter so as you would expect this will print this duck is walking the stuck is quacking you caught the critter now with duct typing we can pass in a different type of object as long as it has the same methods and or attributes as our duck we could pass in a chicken because a chicken can also walk and talk so this time let's pass in our chicken as an argument and this will still work even though our parameter is set up to take a duck object this chicken is walking this chicken is clucking you caught the critter in layman's terms think of it like this python is examining this chicken object it's using its walk method it's using its talk method which are required and python is saying well that's close enough remember if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck then it must be a duck so duct typing is the concept where the class of an object is less important than the methods and or attributes that it might have the class type is not checked if the minimum methods and or attributes are present now let's say with our chicken object our chicken can no longer walk well we cannot pass in our chicken object anymore we have an attribute error chicken object has no attribute walk so python took a look at this chicken and noticed that it does not have a walk method well it's not walking like a duck but it's talking like a duck so it doesn't count as a duck because it doesn't have its walk method in conclusion the class type of an object is not as important as the methods and or attributes that that class might have when using duct typing the class type will not be checked if the minimum methods and or attributes are present since chickens can both walk and talk like ducks then they can be a substitute for ducks when we pass in our duck object to this method so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that is the basics of duct typing in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to discuss the walrus operator in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people i hope you like walruses because that's the topic of this video we'll be discussing the walrus operator also known as an assignment expression it's a colon followed by an equal sign and it kind of looks like a walrus on its side now this is a new feature for python 3.8 what it does is that it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression here's an example of why the walrus operator would be useful let's say we have a variable named happy happy equals true if you're not happy or you're feeling so so you can set this to false if you want so let's print the value contained within happy so this will print true to the console window now wouldn't it be cool if we could combine both of these statements together so we would want to say something such as happy equals true and then print it to the console window using one line of code well normally we can't do this using the standard assignment operator now one thing that we can do is use the walrus operator this assigns a value to a variable as part of a larger expression so this would technically be allowed if this assignment operator was instead an assignment expression the walrus operator happy walrus true and when they're all within a print statement we can assign a value to a variable and use it as a part of a larger expression so as you can see this new variable of happy was assigned and used in one expression now here's a more practical example of why the walrus operator would be useful let's say we have the smell program what this will do is consistently ask you what food you like and put it into a list called foods foods equals list while true food equals input what food do you like if food equals quit break then append our list of foods with this new food item that we have okay let's run this then so this while loop will continue as long as i don't type in quit and it will consistently ask me what food do i like and place that food item into a list named foods so let's begin what food do i like well i do like pizza i like sushi and i like ice cream and that should be enough for me i'm going to type in quit to exit this program now let's write the same program but instead use a walrus operator so that we can write this program using less lines of code now if i were to use the walrus operator this is how i would write the same program we would still need our list foods equals list now for my while loop it's going to look something like this while food walrus operator input what food do you like all right this is the assignment portion now we can use this assignment portion within a larger expression so let's also check to see if our input does not equal quit alright so then after each iteration of this while loop we will take our list foods dot append food and that is it so we have written the same program in about half the lines of code that we did previously so let's test it what food do you like pizza sushi ice cream and quit well everybody that is the basics of the walrus operator also known as an assignment expression it's a new feature for python 3.8 and beyond so if this doesn't work for you i would check to see what version of python you're using first it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that is how the walrus operator works in python hello what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you guys how we can assign a function to a variable in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey all in today's video i will show you all how we can assign a function to a variable this video will be a prerequisite for a few videos i have coming up regarding functions now let's say we have a function named hello and all we'll do is print the word hello and as you know to call this function you would type the name of the function followed by a set of parentheses and this will print the word hello the set of parenthesis that comes after a function's name is the portion that will call the function if you were to remove that set of parenthesis afterwards we would not in fact call that function now with python python will pretty much treat everything as objects including functions so there's something i want to show you guys if i was to print the name of my function hello what will be displayed is the memory address of this function this is the memory address of where this function is located within my computer's memory and it's in hexadecimal think of it like a street address such as one two three fake street this is the address of where this function is within my computer's memory and each time that i run this program this number can change as you can see here now one thing that we could do we could assign this address to a variable let's say hi equals hello and be sure that you're not adding that set of parentheses afterwards because then you would be calling the hello function and returning the result to high so high equals hello no parentheses and if i was to print hi well the address of hello and hi will be at the same memory address both of these numbers are the same now what do you imagine would happen if i was to call the high function after we assigned the memory address of hello to hi well then what we'll end up doing is calling the hello function even though we're listing that we would like to call the high function even though it doesn't exist so it's as if this hello function has two names you can either use hello or you can use hi and let me demonstrate that so you can call either hello hi or both for this example that's because we're assigning the memory address of hello to this variable of high so we could treat high as a function it's kind of like an alias where this function has two names now here's another demonstration let's say that we would like to assign our built-in print function to a variable so let's say maybe say say equals print and when i say print i'm referring to the print function and be sure you're not adding that set of parentheses afterwards now if i need to print something to the console window i can either use print like what we've previously been doing or i could use say because say has the same memory address let's say perhaps whoa i can't believe this works surprise face all right so we can call the print function by saying the word say say all of this text and this will print all of this text well say all of this text to the console window under normal circumstances i'm not sure why or when you would need to assign the print function to a variable but you can and well that's kind of cool so i thought i'd show you guys that so everybody that's how to assign a function to a variable like i said we'll be building upon this topic so you want to be sure that you understand this all right then well if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comments section down below but yeah that's how to assign a function to a variable in python hey uh what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in today's video i'm going to explain higher order functions in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right ladies and gentlemen let's talk about higher order functions these are functions that do one of two things one they either accept a function as an argument or two they return a function as output and in python this is totally allowed because functions are also treated as objects i'll give you guys an example of both of these but let's begin with number one here's an example of number one let's say that i have two functions named loud and quiet both of these functions will accept a string as an argument loud will return that string all uppercase as if we're shouting something quiet we'll return that text i'll lowercase as if we're whispering something now i'm going to create a third function called hello and this will be the higher order function it accepts a function as an argument i'm not sure if we're going to be passing in loud or quiet whatever it is i'm going to give it a name of funk short for function each of these functions will return some text either all uppercase or lowercase i'm going to assign that to text text equals the name of our function we're not sure what it's going to be and i will pass in some text in order to call one of these functions i will pass in just the word hello that's capitalized and at the end i will print whatever text that we have in order to call this function of hello i need to pass in a function as an argument do i want to pass in loud or quiet do i want the loud variety of hello where all of the text will be uppercase or the quiet variety of flow where all the text will be lowercase i would like to pass in loud because i want to make my text all uppercase so i'm typing the name of the higher order function and passing in a function as an argument and the result is that the word hello will be printed to the console window all uppercase now here's a rundown of what just happened we're calling the hello function and we're passing in loud as an argument we're naming loud as funk while we're within this hello function text equals loud and we're sending a string of text that says hello we're returning that text all uppercase assigning it to a variable called text and printing that text to the console window now if i would like to use the quiet variety of hello then i'm going to pass in quiet as an argument so quiet will make all of this text lowercase alright people so that's example one of a higher order function a higher order function is a function that accepts a function as an argument this hello function is an example of a higher order function because we're accepting either loud or quiet as arguments all right people let's move on to the second part of this definition for higher order functions a higher order function is a function that returns a function i'm going to give a different example this time let's say we have a pair of nested functions the outer function will be named divisor and we will accept a number as an argument that we will call x a divisor is a number that is used to divide another number when using division and inside this function we have an inner function named dividend dividend is the number that's going to be divided and we will call the argument that is passed in y all we'll do is return y divided by x we're dividing the dividend by the divisor y divided by x now within the outer function but not within the inner function we're going to return our dividend function so a higher order function is a function that returns a function divisor is a higher order function because we're returning dividend now if i would like to access this nested dividend function i first need to call the outside divisor function and pass in a number as an argument to serve as the divisor the divisor function is going to return my dividend function which we can then assign to a variable so the variable i'm going to name divide divide equals and i need to call divisor and set a divisor let's say that i would like to divide all numbers by two so i will set x to be two and now for the dividend i will print call the divide variable and pass in a number as the dividend the number that's going to be divided and let's say i would like to divide 10 by two and this will work as you can see we have five in the console window so let me explain what just happened here so our program begins here divisor and we're passing in two x will be two and it will stay that way until we finish this program or until we reassign x now x equals two we're skipping this function because we did not call it yet we're returning dividend and assigning it to a variable and we can call a variable if it has the memory address of a function which is what we're doing in this line now we're calling dividend and passing in 10 so y equals 10 and x still equals to we're returning 10 divided by 2 and printing it to the console window well everyone in conclusion a higher order function is a function that either one accepts a function as an argument or two they return a function the format is a little bit strange and we're not quite used to it yet but in future videos we'll have more practice with high order functions if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how higher order functions work in python yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well in today's video i'm going to explain lambda functions in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right ladies and gentlemen let's talk about lambda functions these are functions that are written in one line and use this lambda keyword they accept any number of arguments but they only have one expression think of it as a shortcut they're useful if you need a function for only one use or a short period of time and then you're just planning on throwing away that function afterwards here's the syntax for a lambda function you type lambda you add the parameters followed by a colon and then your expression let's say we have this function named double double accepts one argument that we will name x we're returning x times two effectively doubling it so if i need to call this function i would type double and then pass in a number as an argument so the result if i pass in 5 would be 10. now let's write the same function but instead write it as a lambda function so let me turn these lines into comments now the first step is to type lambda then our parameters we only have one parameter and that is x colon and then our expression we would like to return x times two now this lambda function is going to return a function object and we can assign that much like what we do with variables let's say double equals lambda x colon x times two and in order to call this lambda function we're going to type double then a set of parentheses to call this function and then pass in our arguments so let's say that x equals 5 and then we're going to double it and the result is 10. so that's the syntax for a lambda function you type lambda your parameters colon and then your expression this time let's say that we have two parameters we have two numbers that we want to multiply by each other so let's say that this function will be called multiply multiply equals lambda x comma y because we have two parameters colon followed by our expression we would like to multiply x times y and that is it now in order to call multiply we need to pass in two arguments if i were to pass in just one well we'll have a type error so let's pass in five and maybe six and the result is thirty now let's try three parameters let's say we would like to add three numbers together let's say add lambda x comma y comma z so we have all of our parameters we have our colon here and then we need our expression x plus y plus z and let's add five six and seven together the result is 18. now let's try something a little more complex let's pass in some strings this time i'll create a function named full name full name equals lambda first name comma last name the expression is going to be first name plus perhaps a space plus last name now i need to pass in a first name and a last name full name and you can use your own name for this example if you want let's say bro comma code yep this will print your first name and your last name to the console window now let's take it a step further let's say we would like to check somebody's age once using a lambda function we would like to check to see if they're 18 or older because they're signing up for something perhaps let's say a credit card so let's create a function object age check equals lambda we have one parameter somebody's edge colon and then our expression let's type true if age is greater than or equal to 18 else false to call this age track function we need to pass in an age let's say the user is 12 and they're trying to sign up for a credit card while this will return false let's say they're 18 now and this will return true so that's a lambda function it's a function that is written in one line using this lambda keyword they accept any number of arguments but they only have one expression think of it like a shortcut and they're useful if you need to use a function only once and then you're just planning on throwing it away afterwards so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah those are lambda functions in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can sort iterables in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show well well well welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you all how we can sort data using python we'll begin with the sort method which is used with lists and the sort function which is used with iterables and that would include lists let's start with something very basic and then we'll crank up the difficulty one step at a time i have a list named students and i have a bunch of student names within this list we have squidward sandy patrick spongebob mr krabs let's say that all of these students are taking a college course perhaps on marine biology what i would like to do is to sort this list in alphabetical order and to do that we have a method that is built in with lists so type the name of your list students dot sort and it's easy as that and to display this list i think i'll use a for loop for i in students print i and there you go that's how to sort a list starting with the top we have mr krabs then patrick sandy spongebob and squidward the sort method of lists can accept keyword arguments there are two optional keyword arguments that we can pass in we can pass in key and or reverse we'll cover key a little bit later if we set reverse to true then our list will be sorted by reverse alphabetical order beginning with squidward spongebob sandy patrick then mr krabs now the sort method does not work with other iterables it's a built-in method for lists if our list of students was instead let's say a tuple well then the sort method is not going to work you can see here that we have an attribute error tuple object has no attribute of sort that's where the sort function would come in because that's useful for other iterables you can also use this for a list 2 i suppose the sort function will return a sorted list so let's use the sort function this time and we'll assign the result to a list called sorted students equals sorted and then we need to pass in an iterable and we have the option of passing in a key and or reverse the iterable that we'll pass in as an argument is our tuple named students so this line will be sorted students equals sorted students sorted students is a list the sorted function will return a list but it accepts an iterable as an argument and to display this we should change 4i and students to 4i in sorted students and now this function will accept our iterable our tuple and create a sorted list and all of these are in alphabetical order and to reverse this we can pass in the keyword argument of reverse equals true and now our list is sorted in reverse alphabetical order all right we're gonna take it up a level welcome to level two sometimes data isn't always as simple here we have a list of tuples each tuple has a corresponding student record we have a name a letter grade for their college course and the student's age now how can we sort this list of tuples by either the student's name their grade or their age well that's where the key keyword argument's going to come in with sorting if you take a look at this list of tuples it somewhat resembles a spreadsheet there's rows and then there's columns the first column corresponds to student names the second column are grades and the third column are all the ages of the students so by default sorting by the first column is actually really easy that's the default so if we need to sort alphabetically that would be the same process as before we would type the name of the list students dot sort but if we were to print this iterable for i in students instead of just the individual student names we're going to get each tuple that we have so now all of these tuples are arranged in alphabetical order starting with the first column that we have which are all the student names now how can we sort these iterables by their second column for this case it would be student grades or even the third column which would be the student ages well that's where the key keyword argument's going to come in this is a keyword argument and we set key equal to a function that's going to return the index of that specific column that we have so let's say key equals grid grade is going to be a function object grade equals and we can easily use a lambda expression for this lambda let's say grades colon grades and we will set an index of one now the first index is zero that's the first column because computers always start with zero column two would have an index of one and then column three would have an index of two so grade equals lambda grids colon grids index one you can also rename these if you want so students dot sort we're setting the key equal to grade and grade is a function object via a lambda function and now all of these students will be sorted by their grades starting with sandy then spongebob mr krabs patrick then squidward if this needs to be in reverse order we can pass in that other keyword argument of reverse equals true and for practice if you wanted to sort all of this data by each student's age then we would change grade to let's say age age equals lambda we'll change grades to maybe ages colon ages and the index would then be two because the first column here is zero then one then two and change key to our function object of edge now each student is sorted numerically beginning with the smallest edge well the youngest person starting with spongebob sandy patrick squidward then mr krabs and like i said before if you want your data arranged in reverse order you can set that keyword argument of reverse to true within the sort method and all of our student data is sorted beginning with the eldest student which is mr krabs then squidward patrick sandy and then spongebob and for the last part of this video let's say that we're working with some other iterable let's say we have a tuple of tuples instead well we can no longer use this sort method because that only belongs to lists you can also use the sort function with lists and it will generate a new sorted list without changing the placement of the original so let's say we have a tuple of tuples and this will create a new sorted list let's call this list sorted students equals then we'll use the sorted function we need to pass in an iterable and we can pass in both a key and or the reverse keyword argument so the iterable would be students and let's set the key equal to edge and i will not reverse it we can keep it as it is but let's change for i in students to sorted students and that's how to use the sorted function to sort an iterable including a list well all right everyone that's how to sort iterables in python if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comments section down below but yeah that's a basic way to sort iterables in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well in today's video i'm going to show you all how the map function works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show what up everybody let's discuss the map function the map function will apply a function to each item in an interval that would include lists tuples things like that and the map function accepts two arguments are iterable as well as the function we would like to apply to each item within our iterable for example let's say that we have an online store to represent this i have a list of tuples named store each tuple within this list corresponds to an item for sale within our store there's shirts pants jackets and socks and each item has a price in us dollars let's say now what i would like to do is to convert all of the prices within my store to euros and currently the conversion rate as of the filming of this video is one us dollar to 0.82 euros so let's begin we can easily convert dollars to euros with a lambda function so let's say two euros equals lambda the parameter will be data colon and the next part's a little bit tricky within a set of parenthesis to represent a tuple we'll take data at index 0 that corresponds to the first column comma data at index 1. this represents the index of our prices we're going to take data at index 1 times 0.82 and that's it the first column will be left untouched but the data in column 1 will be multiplied by 0.82 now our map function is going to create a map object but we can easily cast that to a different type of iterable so let's say that store underscore euros equals map parenthesis and then we can pass in our function as well as our iterable our function is our two euros function comma and our iterable is our store and that is it now if you want to convert this map object to an iterable you can easily surround this with a cast i would like to convert this map object to a list and we will now have a new store named store euros which will have all of the different prices of our store in euros and to display this i'll use a for loop for i in store euros print i and let's try it yep that seems about right all of the prices in our store are now in euros let's pretend that these prices are already in euros and we would like to convert these to american dollars so we will use the same conversion rate but divide by 0.82 so let's create a separate lambda function two dollars equals i think i'll just copy this but we are going to divide the first index of data by 0.82 and let's say store dollars to represent our store in dollars because we're pretending now that it's currently in euros and we will display 4i in store dollars so if all of these prices are in euros we are now converting them to american dollars but you may want to do some rounding as opposed to the nearest descent well everyone that is the map function it applies a function to each item in an iterable those include lists tuples the like you pass in your iterable and your function as an argument to the map function so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how the map function works in python what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in today's video i'm going to show you all how the filter function works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right all right let's discuss the filter function the filter function creates a collection of elements from an iterable for which a function returns true now what the heck does that mean let me explain let's say that we have a list of tuples named friends each tuple has the name of a friend as well as their age i just made up some ages for all of these friends what i would like to do is to create a separate list for all the friends that are 18 or older so let's say that we're all going out drinking and i would like to create a list of my drinking buddies because they're of drinking age i'm in the united states and the drinking age is currently 21 but i think worldwide is 18 so let's go with 18 for this example since i have a worldwide audience all right now with this filter function we have to pass in our iterable as well as a function to get anybody's edge that is over 18. so let's begin by writing a lambda function for this expression here our filter function so let's say age equals lambda data will be the parameter colon data at index one so the first index the first column in this chart here would be zero for other names the next index of one would be all the ages data at index one is greater than or equal to eighteen and that is it that is our lambda function and now we're going to filter our iterable by this function of age so let's write filter pass in our function which is edge comma and our iterable friends now this filter function will return a filter object you can easily cast this i would like to cast my friends list back into a list and i will assign this to a new list let's say drinking buddies equals list filter age and friends and i should be able to print all of the friends that are 18 or older for i in drinking bodies print i and we have rachel monica chandler and ross well everyone that is the filter function it creates a collection of elements from an iterable for which a function returns true i like to think of it as the search results we're searching for any results that meet this criteria where age is greater than or equal to 18 and then you can create a separate collection or other list if you want from the results but yeah that is how the filter function works in python yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in today's video i'm going to show you how the reduce function works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show well i suppose we're on the reduce function today the reduce function applies a function of our choosing to an iterable and reduces that iterable to a single cumulative value the way this works is that the reduce function performs our function on the first two elements of our iterable and repeats the process until only one value remains i kind of like to think of it like we're recycling elements within an iterable until a single value remains our finished product so how is this useful let's say that we're playing a game scramble and we have a bunch of different letters within an iterable a list is a type of iterable so i have a list named letters and we have all of the letters we need to spell the word what i would like to do is to reduce all of these individual elements into a single cumulative value until only one value remains so we can do that using the reduce function you can also do this with the for loop too there's multiple ways of doing this so using the reduce function we're going to import func tools and now let's say we have our cumulative value stored within a variable named word word equals func tools dot reduce now the reduce function has two arguments the function we would like to apply to the first two elements and then our iterable the interval is easy that is just letters so let's put that in letters and for the function we can easily write a lambda function for this lambda and now this function needs two parameters let's say x and y now what kind of function do we want to perform on the first two elements of our iterable let's combine them together so let's say x plus y and now let's print our single cumulative value of word so this should print the word hello i'm fairly confident that the word hello is worth like 20 points in scrabble now let me explain what happened step by step our reduce function applies our function to the first two elements within our iterable it performs this expression that we set x plus y but really we can write anything here so we perform this expression on the first two elements then we repeat the process again using the result from the first time we use this expression and the next element so we're combining x plus y again and then we're just going to repeat this process until only one value remains it's kind of like we're recycling all of these letters and creating a finished product out of all of these that's how i think of it at least here's a different example let's say that i would like to find the factorial of 5 so i have the numbers 5 through 1 within a list named factorial so if i was to find the factorial of 5 via the reduce function i would probably write something like this so let me change word to let's say result result equals functools reduce now our lambda function will be x times y because with factorials we multiply the next two numbers together then we take that result and then multiply the next one in this list so the iterable will be factorial and let's print what our result is so the factorial of 5 should be 120. now let's walk through this we're taking the first two elements of this iterable five and four multiplying together in this case in the last example we concatenated the strings together of x and y in this example we're multiplying them together so we take the first two elements 5 times 4 we take the result and apply it to the next iteration of x times y again so 20 times 3 is 60. we repeat this process again 60 times 2 is 120 and 120 times 1 is 120 so that's kind of how the reduce function works it applies a function of our choosing to the first two elements of an iterable and repeats that process until only a single cumulative value remains so that is the reduce function if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how the reduce function works in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how list comprehensions work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody so list comprehensions a list comprehension is a way to create a new list with less syntax you can also use a list comprehension to mimic certain lambda functions such as in the previous videos where we use the map and the filter functions and not only that but a list comprehension is easier to read than a lambda function but there is a formula that we're going to follow when we create our list within our list we're going to write an expression for item in iterable now let me give you an example of where a list comprehension would be useful let's take this program that will create a list of all the numbers 1 through 10 squared so if i were to print this we'll get the numbers 1 through 10 whatever their square is right so we have 1 through 10 and the square of 10 is 100 so we wrote this program in three lines of code we're creating an empty list we're creating a for loop and then we're writing an expression for what we want each loop iteration to do now let's write the same program but used a list comprehension and we can write the same program with less syntax so i would write something like this and we're going to follow this formula so our list is going to be named squares equals then within a set of straight brackets we're going to write our expression which is this portion i times i for item so that would be 4i in our iterable that would be range 1 through 11 because remember 11's exclusive and then let's print our squares print squares and there you go we made the exact same program using a list comprehension so basically speaking you just follow this formula you set your list equal to your expression and our expression for this example is i times i for item for i in your interval in range one through eleven so this took three lines of code well if you exclude us printing our list and this program took one line of code now we can also use a list comprehension to mimic certain lambda functions i wrote a program where we will be filtering a list of student grades let's pretend that all of these students took some sort of exam so we have one student that received a 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 and then one student got a zero because they didn't show up so what i would like to do is to filter all of these student grades into a list that only contains students that passed and the criteria for a passing grade will be a 60 or above so i would like to filter all passing students and if i was to write this program using the filter function i would probably write something like this so i need a function and then my list that i'm working with lambda x colon x is greater than or equal to 60 will filter all of the results and then convert it to a list named past students so the result will look something like this i have five student grades in here with 100 90 80 70 and 60. now let's write the same program using a list comprehension now there's just one portion to this formula for list comprehension that we're going to add at the end we're going to add if conditional we can check some sort of condition after each iteration so let's write the same program using a list comprehension following this new updated formula that we have so we need our list which will be named past students equals first comes our expression and it's just i for this example for item i in our iterable of students and then if we can check our conditional if i is greater than or equal to 60 and this will have the same effect as our previous program but instead it uses a list comprehension now if your program has multiple output if you need an else statement within your conditional you're actually going to move this portion of the if conditional within our formula to right after the expression so let's write an if else statement here so let's say that instead of just excluding any student that didn't pass we'll replace their grade with the word failed and we can do that using an if else statement so let's do this again i'm going to copy what we have here paste it and we'll move our conditional from the end to just after the expression portion i if i is greater than or equal to 60 and you can see here that we need to add an else statement else will return the word failed so we're replacing each instance of a failing grade with the word failed instead so if your condition returns whatever i is you can just add that to the end if you need an if else statement you're going to add it right after the expression so everybody in conclusion a list comprehension is a way to create a new list with less syntax you can even mimic certain lambda functions which we did with the filter function and it has the added benefit of being easier to read than a lambda function so you just follow one of these formulas depending on what you're trying to do so you need at least list equals your expression for item and your interval if you have a condition that you want to check you just add that to the end of your list comprehension if you have an if else statement then you'll add that to right after the expression so you just follow one of these formulas depending on how you want to write your program so that is a list comprehension if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comments section down below and well yeah that's how list comprehensions work in python yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain dictionary comprehensions in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay people dictionary comprehensions they're very similar to list comprehensions except they're with dictionaries that's it video over okay but seriously a dictionary comprehension is a way to create dictionaries using an expression and they can replace for loops and certain lambda functions and all we have to do is follow this formula dictionary equals key colon our expression for key value in iterable so let's go over a few examples our first example we're going to take this dictionary named cities in f f is short for fahrenheit i have different city names as keys and relative temperatures as values in fahrenheit so new york is 32 degrees fahrenheit boston is 75. los angeles is 100 and chicago is 50. and what we'll be doing is creating a separate dictionary where all of these temperatures will be in celsius using a dictionary comprehension so let's follow this formula let's create a new name for this dictionary let's say cities in c short for celsius equals and we will follow this pattern first our key golden then our expression we'll go back to this in just a moment for key comma value in our iterable of cities in f and since we're working with a dictionary we're going to use the items method now we just need to fill in this expression there is a formula to convert fahrenheit to celsius and it should be on the screen right about now so let's follow this formula so we'll take our value minus 32 and just for good measure i'm going to put these within parentheses and we will multiply all of this by 5 divided by 9 and that is it so we have our key our expression to convert fahrenheit to celsius for key value in our iterable of cities in f our previous dictionary and let's test this by printing our new dictionary cities in c actually i think i'm going to round these numbers just so it's more readable so let's round all this there we go so new york and celsius is zero boston is 24. los angeles is 38 and chicago is 10. so we created a new dictionary using a dictionary comprehension now with these dictionary comprehensions you can add an if conditional to the end of this so let's say that we have a separate dictionary of weather like a description of the weather in each city new york is snowing boston is sunny los angeles is sunny and chicago is cloudy let's say that we would like to create a separate dictionary with a dictionary comprehension that only has cities where the weather is sunny so i would write something like this let's say sunny weather will be the name of our dictionary equals and we'll follow this formula and then we just tack on our conditional to the end so it's kind of the same as before really so key colon and we don't really have an expression here so let's just say value then for key comma value in our iterable of weather dot items then our conditional if value sunny because we are only looking for sunny weather and let's print this print our dictionary of sunny weather and let me just make this more readable for you guys and our new dictionary comprehension will create a dictionary of key values where the value is sunny using an if conditional at the end of our dictionary comprehension here's a third example for you well if you have an if else condition you can add that to where the expression is within your dictionary comprehension so i'm going to reuse the previous dictionary for the first example where we have cities and their temperatures as values so we're going to replace each temperature with a description of the weather is it warm or is it cold so let's do that using a dictionary comprehension that contains an if else statement so let's say we have a new dictionary named desk short for description cities it's a brief description of each city's temperature so we follow this formula key then our if else conditional for key value and iterable actually i probably can copy all this just to save some time okay so our iterable will be cities dot items and our conditional is going to be we will return warm if our value is greater than or equal to let's say 40. else cold and we will print our new dictionary of desk cities description of cities so new york is cold because it's 32 that's below 40. boston is warm los angeles is warm and chicago is warm now if your condition gets somewhat complex you can even call a separate function to keep your code more organized so key then we can call a function and pass in a value for key value in iterable so i'm going to again reuse our city names and our temperatures and this time we are going to call a function instead i think i'll reuse this code from the previous example where we have a separate dictionary named desk cities and i'm going to replace this if else statement with a function so let's say we have a function that is named check temp and we will pass in our value and we just need to define this function so let's define that here so let's define check temp and our parameter is our value that we're currently working on within our dictionary value then we'll write if value is greater than or equal to let's say anything above how about 70 will return the word hot then else if let's say 69 greater than or equal to value and then value is greater than or equal to how about 40 then we will return the word warm and lastly else return cold and let me just fix some of the spacing now depending on the temperature that is stored within each value of our dictionary we will call a function that will return one of a few different outputs so it's kind of like we're using the map function the map lambda function so let's print our description of cities and we should get a short description of the temperature in each city after we call the check temperature function and then pass in each value from our dictionary so new york is cold because it's 32 degrees fahrenheit boston is hot because it's above 70. los angeles is hot because it's 100 and then chicago is warm because that is 50 which is between 69 and 40 within our function so that is a dictionary comprehension it's a shortcut where you can create dictionaries using an expression and they can replace for loops and certain lambda functions so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how dictionary comprehensions work in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in today's video i'm going to show you how the zip function works in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right ladies and gentlemen welcome back we're talking about the zip function today the zip function will aggregate elements from two or more iterables iterables are those things like lists tuples sets etc and the zip function will create a zip object with paired elements from each iterable stored in a tuple for each element within our zip object here's an example let's say that we have two different types of iterables i have a list of usernames and a few usernames within here are dude bro and mr and i have a tuple of passwords and i have some very secure passwords such as password abc123 and guest what i would like to do is to zip elements from each iterable together so that they're in pairs and each pair is going to be stored as a tuple within a zip object and here's how we can do that let's say that we will create a zip object called users and we will use the zip function the zip function will take a varying amount of iterables we're going to pass in our usernames and passwords and zip them together so let's pass in usernames as well as passwords and now our zip object of users is actually iterable zip objects are iterable so we can use them within a for loop so let's type for i in users and print i and what we get is that we have a zip object of tuples and each tuple is storing each pair of elements from our two iterables now users is a zip object and if you don't believe me let me prove it i'm going to print the type of users and this will print that users is indeed a zip object but you can easily convert this to a different type of iterable by using a cast let's say that we would like to convert our zip object into a list so we'll surround the zip function with a cast to a list and now the data type of users is now a list what we have is a list of tuples and each tuple is storing a pair of elements from our two iterables of usernames and passwords now currently since we're passing in only two different iterables we can easily make this a dictionary so that these are key value pairs so let's cast our zip object as a dictionary and to display all of the elements within our dictionary all the key value pairs we're going to change our for loop to this for key value in users dot and we will use the items method print key comma value actually i think i'm going to separate each of these with a colon just to make it more readable and now when we zip these two intervals together we end up with a dictionary of usernames and passwords and the name of this dictionary is users now you're not limited to just two iterables you can add a third iterable or more so this time let's create a maybe a list a list of last login dates and i'll just call this login date equals and why not make a list and let's make up some dates let's say 1 1 dash 20 21 12-20-21 and 1-3-20 21 okay so let's create a zip object of users and we're going to zip user names passwords and login date and let's iterate over this for i in users print i now we have a tuple for each element and instead of a pair we now have a trio i guess of all of the different elements from each iterable so in conclusion the zip function will aggregate elements from two or more iterables and create a zip object with paired or grouped together elements stored in a tuple for each element within our zip object so that is the zip function if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how the zip function works in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and i'm going to explain the purpose of if name equals main in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show during your programming journey you may have encountered this strange statement of if name equals main now what the heck does that mean so with python files also referred to as modules by including this statement it gives our modules some flexibility one a module that has the statement can be run as a standalone program or two this module can be imported and used by other modules if there's some sort of useful functions or other resources within this module to be imported by including the statement of if name equals main we're checking to see if a user is running this module as either a standalone program or they're importing it from another module behind the scenes the python interpreter will set special variables one of which is double underscore name it's a variable and python will assign the name variable a value of main if it's the initial module being run and we can actually test that by printing double underscore name so since this is the initial module being run module one for my example name is going to be assigned a value a string of main now check this out i have two modules what if i were to import module 2 and check the name variable of module 2. let's try it import module two in order to access a variable from another module i need to type the name of the module module two dot and i would like to check the special name variable of module 2 and print it so when you import a module this name variable is going to be assigned the name of the module in this case module 2. this time what if we change the roles around i'm going to copy all of this text and paste it within module two we're going to import from module one we will print that special name variable of this module module 2 and then print the name variable of module 1 which is being imported now when i run this program i'm going to instead run from module 2. now this time that special name variable of module 2 is main and the special name variable of module 1 is module 1 the name of the module so by including a statement such as if name equals main we're checking to see if this module is being run directly or indirectly so let's test it within this statement of if name equals main let's print running this module directly else that must mean that we're running this module indirectly so let's print running other module indirectly okay so i'm going to go to module 1 and run from here running this module directly now let's do the same thing with module two but we need to import module one and let's run for module two running other module indirectly for the time being i'm just going to write pass within our if name equals main as a placeholder and get rid of our if statement so let's say within module 1 there's a useful function or resource we would like to access from module 2. so let's say we have a function named hello and all this will do is print the word hello let's just pretend that it's a useful function not really but let's pretend so in order to use this function from module two i need to import module one then type module one dot and then the name of the function so i'm going to run from module 2 and this will print hello but what if i run this program from module 1. so right now module 1 cannot be run directly as a standalone program so i cannot print the word hello so what i could do is within if name equals main i can call that hello function directly so let's run from module one hello one other thing that you might see too within the if statement if name equals main there might be a call for a main function and you can write the main body of your program within a main function so everybody in conclusion the reason that people may include this statement if name equals main is that it allows our modules to have some flexibility they can be run as a standalone program or they can be imported and used by other modules and this is because the python interpreter sets that special variable of name with a value of main if it's the initial module being run if you would like a copy of my code and my notes i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that's the purpose of if name equals main in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all a few useful functions related to times and dates using the time module in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show alright everybody so the time module let's begin by importing time and the first thing that i'm going to explain to you while is how we can find our computer's epic also pronounced as epoch so this is a date and time in which your computer thinks time began think of it that way at least so we use our epic as a reference point so to find your computer's epic it's going to vary based on your computer and your operating system so to find your computer's epic type time dot c time and as an argument we will pass in zero now what this method will do is that this method will convert a time expressed in seconds and convert it to a readable string so if i was to pass in 0 and print it well then this will display the date and time which is my epic our reference point so for me my epic is wednesday december 31st 6 p.m 1969 so i've just added a note that the c time method will convert a time expressed in seconds since epic and convert it to a readable string a readable date and time so for practice let's pass in perhaps 1 million seconds and see what date and time that we receive so our c time method will return a date and time one million seconds past this epic here so that would be for me monday january 12th about 7 a.m 1970. our next method is the time method of the time module let's print time dot time method and what this method will do is return the current seconds that have passed since our epic using our computer's clock so the number that i end up with is just over 1.6 billion and this is in seconds so for me 1.6 billion seconds has passed since that date which is my epic i believe it was december 31st 1969 and every time that i rerun this program you can see that the amount of seconds that has passed is actually increasing so that is the time method it will return the current seconds since you're epic using your computer's clock and you know what just for fun let's change the date and time under clock and see what happens so let's change the year to how about the year 2000 change and close so let's see what number we get with the time method now so we get just under 1 billion 948 million seconds have passed and now if you need to retrieve the current date and time well there's one of a few ways in which you could retrieve that but one way is that we can combine both of these methods of the see time method and the time method of the time module so let's print time dot c time and we're going to pass in an amount of seconds into the c time method as an argument so within the c time method we're going to call the time method so the time method will return an amount of seconds since our epic and the c time method will convert that amount of seconds to a readable date and time so the current date and time is saturday january 23rd about 3 p.m 20 21 now there is more than one way to get the current date and time another way is to use the local time method and the local time method will create a time object based on the current time so what i'm going to do is create a variable called time object and i just need to explain a few things about time objects so to best explain this i'm going to print our time object now a time object is also referred to as a struct time object it is made up of different keyword arguments there's a year a month day hour minutes seconds day of the week day of the year and this keyword argument here has something to do with daylight savings time so there's quite a few uses with time objects and one way is that we can format them however we want because right now this time object is not in a readable format so to convert this time object into a readable string we'll need the help of a separate function and that is the strf time function str is short for string f4 format and time well for time i guess so this function needs two arguments a format and a time object so our strf time function will accept a format and a time object as an argument so our format is really just a string of different directives and to best explain these i'm going to head to python's official documentation on the subject so here i am on python's website regarding the time module and underneath this section on the strf time function there are different directives that we can embed within our format string that we pass in as an argument depending on the directive that we add we can display a certain format of our date and time so for example if i was to pass in let's say percent lowercase a then we will display the time object's weekday name and you're not limited to just one directive you can add any combination of directives so if i was to add percent m well we would display the month of our date time object as a number 1 through 12. so there's a bunch of directives here and i'm going to be using some of these so within a string for the format argument i'm going to pass in percent capital b for the name of the month percent d for the day percent y for the year percent h for the hour and to format this i'm going to add a colon to separate hours and minutes percent m for minutes colon percent s for seconds and then we are going to assign all of this to a variable let's say local time and local time will be a string so let's print our local time and the current time is january 23rd 2021 about 3 p.m oh and i almost forgot you can also get the utc time that is the coordinated universal time if you know how that works so if you need that you would just use the gm time method for the utc time coordinated universal time okay next up we have the strp time function and this function will parse a string representation of a time and or date and return a time object so we need to pass in a string representing the date and or time as well as a format string so let's create a time string and this variable is going to be a string representation of a date let's say 20th of april 2020 and what we can do is take this string representation of a time and or date and parse it to a time object so we're going to pass in our time string variable as well as a format string so let's say i would like to parse the day so that would be percent d for day then percent b for name of the month and then comma percent y for year this function will create a time object so let's assign that to a variable time object equals time dot strp time we're passing in our string representation of a time or date as well as a format string and we can print our time object using a print statement however this is going to be in a form that is somewhat difficult to read but you can see at least we have a time object with all of these keywords filled in with anything that we passed in via these format directives that we have now the next function is the asc time function and this function accepts a time object or a tuple representation of a relative time so this time let's create a time tuple and we're going to follow this order we can pass in up to nine values the first value is a year so let's pass in perhaps 2020 a month let's say four a day how about 20 four hours let's say four minutes 20 and seconds maybe zero let me just fix some of the spacing here okay you can also pass in a numbered day of the week um i'm just going to say zero i don't think it's really that important a day of the year zero and negative one or zero for daylight savings time so we created a time tuple and we can pass in a time object or a tuple representation of a time following this formula so let's pass in our time tuple and this will create a time string a string representation of the time that we create and let's print our time string and we should have april 20th about four in the morning the year 2020. so that is asc time it will convert a tuple representation of a time and date or a time object and convert it to a readable string now another option is to use m k time and mk time will take a tuple representation of a time or a time object and convert it to seconds since epic so april 20th of the year 2020 is about 1.5 billion seconds since our epic date and for me that was december 31st the year 1969 so that is a few useful functions of the time module if you would like a copy of this code i will post all this to the comment section down below and well yeah that's the time module in python yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain multi-threading in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show think of a thread as a flow of execution like a river and each thread can carry out its own separate order of instructions if we use this process of multi-threading we can have our program run different parts of its program at different times they all run concurrently but not truly in parallel that is a concept for later referred to as multi-processing so with reds they each take a turn running to achieve concurrency this is due to a notorious feature known as the gil the global interpreter lock only one thread can be running at one time but they can all take turns when one thread is idle so this allows one thread to hold control of the python interpreter at any one time so they run concurrently but not truly in parallel which is what we do with multi-processing now programs and tasks can be divided into two different categories they can be cpu bound that is a program or a task that spends most of its time waiting for internal events such as a task that is cpu intensive it is better to use multi-processing for tasks that are cpu bound now tasks that are io bound means that the program will spend most of its time waiting for external events such as waiting for user input or if you're doing activities like web scraping you do a lot of sitting around so with i o bound tasks it's better to use multi-threading because we can have multiple threads running concurrently but not truly in parallel like what we do with multi-processing after importing the threading module we can count the number of threads that are currently running in the background whenever we run a program we have one thread that is running that is in charge of executing our program and we can print the active count of threads running in our program using the active count function of the threading module so this will print one we have one thread that is running and we can print a list of all the threads that are running by using the enumerate function so the one thread that is in charge of running our program is referred to as the main thread by using this concept of multi-threading we can have more than one thread running concurrently not truly in parallel all the threads will take turns while one of them is idle so we can have more than one thread running more than just the main thread which is in charge of running the main body of our program so while our main thread is in charge of running the main body of our program we can have another thread that's in charge of a separate part of it maybe like a countdown timer or something so one good example take that quiz game that we made some number of videos ago while we were waiting for user input which is a i o bound task we could have had a countdown timer going like you only have so many seconds to answer this question we could have had one thread in charge of waiting for user input and another thread in charge of the countdown timer so that's an example of multi-threading we had two threads running concurrently and what we'll be doing in this video is creating a program that involves multi-threading we can have different threads in charge of different parts of our program and they can all run concurrently they'll all take turns while one of them is idle so let's say that we're running late for school or work in the morning and we have three different tasks that we need to complete before we can leave for school or work so think of three different things you do in the morning such as maybe eat breakfast some people drink coffee or maybe a beverage of your choice so drink coffee and some people like me they like to do their homework last minute so i'll say study before i leave for work or school in the morning so what we'll do in each of these functions each of these functions should take some amount of time to complete so we can have our main thread sleep for a given number of seconds using the sleep function time dot sleep and let's say that in order for me to eat breakfast this task will take me three seconds let's just pretend that instead of minutes this will be in seconds so drink coffee will take me four seconds and study will take me five seconds then when we finish sleeping let's print a confirmation message let's say you eat breakfast as in you finish eating breakfast with drink coffee you drink coffee and with study you finish studying now each of these tasks are i o bound they're going to be spending a lot of time just waiting around for external events they're waiting for the sleep function to expire before they can finish their task so we're going to have all of these three functions run on our main thread and we'll see how long it takes for us to complete our morning ritual these three tasks so let's call these three functions within our main thread so let's call the eat breakfast function first followed by drink coffee and then study in that order so this program is going to take approximately let's see 12 seconds to complete so there's going to be a pause for a second you eat breakfast then followed by you drank coffee and then study you finished studying so this program took about 12 seconds overall so if this were realistic what we would have done is we would sit down and eat breakfast for three minutes well three seconds in this case and then once we finish eating breakfast only then are we allowed to drink our coffee and once we finish our coffee only then can we study so we completed these tasks sequentially and not concurrently for us to move down to the next function we need to complete the previous functions because we're doing this in order but realistically us human beings we would probably eat breakfast drink coffee and study altogether because we can multitask and we can complete these three functions in less time and that's kind of the same process as multi-threading we can have these three separate functions running concurrently as if we're multitasking we're eating breakfast drinking coffee and studying all at once now currently we have one thread that is in charge of these three separate functions what we could do is that we can create three additional threads each thread will be in charge of each task and then we'll have our main thread running in the background that will complete the rest of the program so this is how to create an additional thread let's say that x equals threading dot thread we need to pass in a target target equals and then the name of the function so let's say thread x will be in charge of eating breakfast and then you can pass in arguments too if your function has parameters by typing args and then you pass in a tuple so let's say you have one argument to pass in you'll type your argument followed by a comma but we don't have any arguments in this example but you'll need to be sure to enter them in if you do have any okay then to begin this thread you type the name of the thread in this case x dot start so we now have an additional thread and this thread is in charge of eating breakfast now let's create another thread to drink coffee and we'll call this y and the target will be drink coffee and lastly we have a thread in charge of studying and this will be z and the target is our study function okay now let's see how long it takes for us to complete our program oh and be sure to comment out these function calls within the main thread because we don't want the main thread in charge of those anymore okay now we can run the program so we have four threads running this time you eat breakfast you drink coffee you finish studying so this program took approximately five seconds to finish and the reason that this program took five seconds instead of 12 is because before our main thread was in charge of running these tasks sequentially in order but now since we have a thread dedicated to each task we can run them all concurrently instead of sequentially so that this program now took about five seconds to complete and you may have noticed too that the activecount function as well as the enumerate function were called before threads 1 2 and 3 finished their respective tasks that's because the main thread is not going to wait around for these three threads to complete it has its own set of instructions to do so it is no longer in charge of these three functions the program is going to handle those three functions to our three threads and our main thread is going to continue its own set of instructions its job is to print the active count as well as call the enumerate function which it did and it finished its tasks before threads one two and three now one trick that you can do too is that you can use the time modules performance counter function and this function will return how long it takes our calling thread as in our main thread to finish its set of instructions so our main thread is not in charge of executing these three functions our main thread is in charge of creating three additional threads and then calling the activecount function and the enumerate function as well as the performance counter function so our main thread will take approximately 0.075 seconds to complete and our three threads are still running in the background our main threads job its order of instructions is to create three additional threads and then immediately print whatever is returned via the activecount function enumerate and then your performance counter so our main thread says that it finished its tasks in about .07 seconds but threads one through three were still trying to catch up that's why the main thread finished before are three additional threads and once all active threads have completed their tasks then your program will finish and exit there's also this concept called thread synchronization we can have a calling thread in this case our main thread wait around for another thread to finish before it can move on with its own instruction set so let's say we would like our main thread to wait around for thread 1 also known as x so we're going to use the join function of thread x and now our main thread has to wait around for thread x also known as thread 1 to finish before it can move on with its instruction set so let's do the same with y and z so now our main thread before it can move on with the rest of the program has to wait for all of these threads to synchronize and join and then and only then can it move on with the rest of its own instruction set so this time our program is going to look a little something like this you eat breakfast you drink coffee you finish studying so by the time we reach our active count these threads are already joined and synchronized they're no longer active when we enumerate over our active threads we only have our main thread and our main thread completed in about 5.1 seconds this time because it did a lot of waiting around it was waiting for threads x y and z to join and finish in conclusion a thread is a flow of execution like a separate order of instructions that a program can follow and when we run a program we always have at least one thread running initially and that is referred to as the main thread however if you have multiple threads using the concept of multi-threading we can have multiple threads running concurrently but not truly in parallel which is what we'll cover during the video on multi-processing this is due to a feature known as the gil the global interpreter lock which allows only one thread to hold control of the python interpreter at any one time and tasks can be either cpu bound or io bound a cpu bound task is a program or task that spends most of its time waiting for internal events such as a task that is cpu intensive and o bound tasks spend most of their time waiting for external events such as waiting around for user input or web scraping with i o bound tasks it's better to use multi-threading with cpu bound tasks it's better to use multi-processing well everybody that is a quick overview of multi-threading i will post all of this code to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to achieve multi-threading using python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain demon threads in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay so demon threads also pronounced as daemon threads a demon thread is a thread that runs in the background and they are normally not important for your program in order to run your program will not wait for demon threads to complete before exiting whereas non-demon threads they cannot normally be killed they will stay alive until their task is complete so a few common uses of demon threads would be background tasks garbage collection waiting for input or other long-running processes so here's an example of why demon threads would be useful let's say that we'll have two threads our main thread will be in charge of waiting around for some user input we'll ask do you wish to exit and in the background we'll have a timer going that will display how long somebody is logged in so let's create a function named timer and what we'll do is just display how long somebody's logged in so let's say we have a count variable while true we'll use the sleep function of the time module to sleep for approximately one second then we'll increment our count variable by one and we'll print a message so let's say logged in for count seconds and let's create a thread that will be in charge of this timer and run it in the background so let's say x equals threading dot thread the target will be our function of timer and we need to start this thread x dot start so our thread x will be in charge of our timer and run it concurrently while we're waiting for some user input our main thread will be in charge of waiting for this user input do you wish to exit now here's the issue of us using a non-demon thread for a background task such as a countdown timer so our main thread is in charge of waiting around for some user input and thread x our additional thread is in charge of running this countdown timer so if i wish to exit this program i'm just going to type okay and hit enter well my background timer is still going but my main thread is complete so i would like to exit this program but my program will not exit as long as there are non-demon threads that are still alive we cannot normally close this program unless we do like a brute force you know close and exit of the program so we can turn this thread of x into a demon thread so that when we wish to exit the program when there are no more non-demon threads alive and to change a thread to a demon thread it's actually fairly easy when you create your thread you can set this flag of demon equal to true and that's it so when all non-demon threads have finished their tasks your program will complete and exit but if there are demon tasks running in the background they will be killed automatically so let's try this program again so do you wish to exit my program is going to continue running my demon thread is in charge of the timer and it's going to continue running until all non-daemon threads have completed their tasks so once i type ok my program will finish running and my countdown timer will stop because all demons are killed when your program is finished running there's also two additional methods that you might be interested in you can use the set daemon method of a thread and you can set it to false or true if you would like to change a thread to a non-demon or a demon however if your thread is currently running well you cannot actually change it from a non-demon thread to a demon thread while it's currently running so you would have to do that before you actually use the start function and you can also check to see if a thread is a demon or not by using the is demon method this will return true or false so everybody in conclusion a demon thread is a thread that runs in the background and they're not important for your program in order to continue running your program will not wait for demon threads to complete before exiting the program whereas non-demon threads cannot normally be killed they will stay alive until their task is complete and demon threads are commonly used for background tasks garbage collection waiting around for input or other long running processes so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah those are demon threads in python yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain multi-processing in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show what's up let's talk about multi-processing multi-processing is the act of running tasks in parallel on a different cpu cores it's different from multi-threading although it sounds similar because with multi-threading we're limited to running one thread at a time because of the gil that lock which is used for threading we can run threads concurrently but not in parallel however with multi-processing we can create processes and we can run each process in parallel on a different cpu course so with multi-processing it's better for tasks that are cpu bound where you need heavy cpu usage whereas multi-threading that is better for i o bound tasks where you do a lot of waiting around so before we begin i recommend these two imports multi-processing and time let's begin quick note if you're running the windows operating system you'll probably need to add this line if name is equal to main so when we run a program we have a main process that is running and if we create a child process from that process it's going to copy the module that we're currently working with and that child process will create its own children processes and it's going to be a problem so we're going to add this line if name is equal to main so when we create a child process it will copy our module but it's not going to execute it so let's create a main function and a majority of our code is going to be within our main function if you're running a different operating system you probably don't have to do this but if you're running windows you probably will now with multi-processing multi-processing is better for tasks or functions that are cpu bound where they require heavy cpu usage let's say that we have a function named counter and we'll pass in a number to count up to but the number we're going to pass in is a ridiculously large number like a billion so let's create a function that will count from zero so count equals zero and while count is less than our number that we pass in we will increment our counter by one so that is the function that we'll call with our processes that we create now within our main function we'll create a process and to do that you'll need the multi-processing module so import process and cpu account and we'll save this for a little bit later to create a process let's say we have process a a equals process this step is very similar to creating a thread we have a target our target will be our function of counter and if we have arguments we will pass those in so remember with our arguments we have to pass in a tuple since we only have one argument to pass in to differentiate this from an expression we have to add a comma at the end so our number let's say is 1 billion so that's a million 10 million 100 million 1 billion let me just verify that okay so that's 1 billion we're going to count from zero to a billion and in order to start this process a my process use the start function and then i will use some process synchronization by using the join function my main process is going to wait around for my child process of a to finish before continuing and let's print our performance counter so we'll print finished in let's say time dot performance counter seconds okay so let's see how long it'll take to count from zero to a billion using one process i fast forwarded this video but it took my program 56.7 seconds to count from zero to a billion but we can speed this up by using multi-processing let's create a second process named b and i'm going to divide the amount of work in half so each process will count to 500 million half of a billion so let's change a to b and i'm gonna group these start functions together just so it's easier to read and then b dot join just to synchronize everything okay and then let's change 1 billion to 500 million for each it's the same amount of work but divided among workers so that is 500 million let's see how well it runs this time so it took my program about 40.3 seconds to finish counting from zero to a billion but i divided that task among different processes each of my two processes counted from zero to 500 million this time so this time let's create four processes so we have a b c and d and we'll need to start them and i'm going to join them now this might not actually speed it up for you and i'll explain why later it depends on the amount of cpu cores that you have okay so oh let's change this to so 250 million for each okay see you in a couple seconds okay welcome back so on my computer when i ran four processes and each was counting up to 250 million i could finish my program in 27.3 seconds now for me if i created more processes than this it would probably take longer and here's why so you can print the cpu count of your computer using this function of cpu count so if i were to print whatever this function returns i can get the count of the number of additional processes that i can run for the time being i'm just going to comment out this start function because i just want to print whatever this value is so my cpu count on my computer is four so i can run four additional processes but let's attempt to run eight processes so i'm going to copy all these and let's say that we have e f g and h and we will start all of those two so give me a second just to start them so a b c d e f g h and then i'm going to join all of them e f g and h okay so let's run this now oh and change the arguments to i keep forgetting to do that so let's say 125 for each so 125 million times eight is one billion okay see you in a bit all right welcome back this time when i had eight processes working it actually took me longer than when i had four processes working when i had four processes working it took me about 27 seconds this time it took 30 seconds when i had eight processes working that's because i had more processes than my cpu count and that's partially because whenever you create a process there's significant overhead with beginning and destroying a process and if i can only run four processes on my computer at one time well then i'm creating additional processes to no extra benefit it's actually hindering the performance of the computer because i'm creating all of these additional processes when it really doesn't help me in conclusion multi-processing is the concept of running tasks in parallel on different cpu cores it's similar but different from multi-threading because with multi-threading we can run tasks concurrently but they're all taking turns because of the gil with multi-processing we can run all of these different tasks together in parallel multi-processing is better for cpu bound tasks where a task has heavy cpu usage and multi-threading is better for i o bound tasks tasks that involve a lot of waiting around so that's multi-processing if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how multi-processing works in python hey what's going on everybody two bro here hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be creating our very first graphical user interface in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome one and all today we'll be creating our very first graphical user interface in python also known as a gui for short we're going to be using the tk inter gui which is a module that is included with python our first step in order to use tk enter is to import this module so that we can begin using it our first line of code will be from tk enter import asterisk this will import everything related to the tk inter module and with this import we can now use all of the gui features that this module has to offer now there is one important distinction that we need to make we need to discuss the differences between windows and widgets here's a few quick definitions that i definitely did not copy from the internet widgets are gui elements such as buttons text boxes labels images you name it and windows they serve as a container to hold or contain these widgets for this topic we'll be creating and customizing our own window and in future topics we'll be exploring different widgets that are available to us so let's begin by creating a simple window and we should give our window a unique name such as window that's pretty creative and in order to instantiate this window we're going to follow this window name with equals tk make sure you get the capitalization right this is a uppercase t and a set of parentheses to serve as the constructor what this will do and i'm just going to add a comment is instantiate an instance of a window for us and when we compile and run this nothing appears to happen that's because we only instantiated our window and we're not actually displaying it in order to display our window we're going to follow this with the name of the window dot main loop and this will display our window and this is our first graphical user interface and we'll be adding widgets to this window so i'm going to add a comment that this will place window on computer screen and it will also listen for events but we'll get to that in future videos now what we'll be doing is customizing the appearance of this window let's begin by changing the size and we can do that with the geometry function so we're going to first begin by typing the name of our window which is window follow this by using the geometry function and we pass in a width and a height but make sure this is within quotes and set this to whatever width and height that you want so if i want 420 by 420 that would be 420 x 420 and the size of our window is now the size that we set with the geometry function now take a look at the top left of this window we have this feather icon as well as a title of tk that's kind of lame so let's change that let's first change the window title and there is a function to do that so we type in the name of our window window dot title function and we can pass in a new title that we want to set and i will set the title to be maybe bro code first gui program that'll work and we now changed the title of this window and it says bro code first gui program the next thing that we can do although not necessary is that we can change the icon of our window bar at the top i would like to replace this feather icon with an image of my choosing here's my desktop don't mind all of the clutter and i would like to use this image of the logo for my channel and set this as the icon for my window so what i'm going to do is copy and then go to my project folder and then paste it click ok and i now have this image within my project folder but it's in a format that we cannot use currently we need to convert this to what's called a photo image that is a format that tk enter can use so we'll need to convert our image to a photo image so do that anywhere within the window between window equals tk and window.main loop right here is good i suppose we're going to create a photo image from this image and this is a png file but yours might be something different so let's give our photo image a unique name like maybe icon and in order to create a photo image we'll follow this with equals photo image and within the constructor of our photo image there is an option for file we can either list the file name or the file path if it's somewhere else on your computer since this image is within my same project folder i only have to list the file name and this is called logo.png and this is probably going to be named something else for you though so we now have this photo image called icon that we can use and i need to set the icon of my window to this icon and luckily there is a function to take care of that for us type in the name of the window which is window dot and we're going to use the icon photo function there are two arguments the first we're going to set to true and the second is the photo image that we want to use and this photo image is called icon so we're going to pass this photo image as an argument to this function of icon photo and now when we compile and run this the image that we wanted to use is now set for the top left icon of this window bar however it loses a lot of the quality since the dimensions are so small but you can still tell that it's my logo though so that's how to replace the icon of your window bar in the top left corner now let's change the background color of this window and one way in which we can do that is to use the config function you can use the config function anytime that you want to make any changes to this window so let's change the background color here and there is an option called background and we can set this equal to either a color name or a hexadecimal value let's begin with just some color names let's say that i want the background color to be black i'll just type in the word black here and this will change the background color of my window to black alternatively you can set a hex value as the color so if you were to look up or google hex color picker you can select whatever color you want let's say that i want a sky blue color like this well this is the hex value i'm going to copy this value and then paste it within the option for my background make sure you have this hashtag as well because that represents that this is a hex value so now the background color is that sky blue color that i picked well everybody that's the basics of creating a window in python and in future videos we're going to be exploring different widgets that we can add to this window that have some functionality so if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to create your very first gui in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create labels in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show what is a label well i'm glad you asked that question it's an area widget that holds text and or an image within a window so to begin we'll need to create a window to act as a container to hold this label we can create a window with window equals tk followed by window.mainloop and this will give us a window in which we can add a label to now let's give our label a unique name such as label and in order to instantiate a label we'll follow this label name with equals label with a capital l and a set of parentheses the parentheses are acting as the constructor for this widget our label and we can pass in arguments into these parentheses the first argument that we're going to pass in is a master the container for this label we're going to pass in the name of our window because our window is acting as the container with widgets in python we can de-eliminate the arguments that we're passing in with a comma and there are options available to us options are keyword arguments that we can pass in to the constructor for this widget one option available to us is text and we can set the text of this label equal to a string that we set so let's say that we want this label to say hello world well we're going to pass in this option text and it's a keyword argument so if we were to do this we're going to set the text of the label but this label currently doesn't appear within our window what gives bro i thought you knew how to code hold up wait a minute there's one more thing that we need to do so we're going to actually add this label to the window now we set the master of the label to be our window but now we actually have to add it as step two one way which we can do that is to use a pack function of our label so follow label equals label and pass in all of your arguments and then follow this with the name of the label dot pack so with the pack option by default this will place our widget in the top center of our window another way in which we can add a label to a container or window is to use the place function and we can set some coordinates of where we want this label or other widget to appear within the window if we want this to appear in the top left corner we can set x to equal zero and y t equals zero and these are options available to us too that we can pass in so this place function will place our label at some position or some set of coordinates within the window and with x equals 0 and y equals 0 that will place our widget in the top left corner of the window and if i were to change these to let's say x equals 100 and y equals 100 well this is going to be placed down by 100 pixels and to the right by 100 pixels so you can use pack or place there's a few others like grid but they're a little more complex so we'll get to that in a future video for the time being i'm going to use the pack function of the label and turn this place function into a comment dot pack all right now how can we customize this label we can pass in different options when we instantiate this label let's change the font and that's another option we can change the font with font equals and then we can pass in a font let's begin with a font family i will say maybe ariel a size perhaps 40 and then a style if you so choose like bold there's also italic and underline uh but this will work just fine then so this will change the font of the text of our label and it says hello world still now let's change the foreground color so that is another option the foreground is the font color and the option is fg for foreground it's short for foreground foreground equals we can state a color name such as green and our text should now be green you can select something more specific by passing in a hex value so a custom color that i like is hashtag zero zero ff00 this is bright green you can always look up what different hex values are and we can also change the background color too that is bg short for background color and we can pass in a color name or a hex value i'm just going to set this to black just to demonstrate that we can pass in both either hex values or color names and what we have is green text on a black background and this is the limits of our label within the window because when we expand this window the label is still going to stay the same size if we were to change the text within the label our label is only going to take up the room that it needs and you can see that our label is now smaller now we have all of these arguments within our constructor and it's getting a little bit difficult to actually read so i'm going to separate each of these arguments line by line just so that this is more organized but it'll work just the same as it did before now how do we add a border around our label one we can set the border style with the relief option and one border that i like is raised but right now the border width is one so it's a little difficult for us to actually see the border let's increase the border width with the option bd and i'll set this equal to maybe 10. so this border is now more visible another relief which is the border style is sunken and this will give our label a sunken appearance but i think i'll change this back to raised we can also add some padding around the text between the text and the border we can pad x and pad y pad x will add some padding some space between the x-axis of our text between the border so let's set this to maybe 20 and we now have 20 pixels worth of space between the text and the border let's also pad y this will add some space above and below our text between the text and the border now how do we add an image to a label we first need to create what's called a photo image and we will create this within the lines of window equals tk and window.main loop and let's give this photo image a unique name like photo and in order to create a photo image we're going to follow this with photo equals photo image and within the constructor of our photo image there's an option called file and we can list a file path or a file name right now on my desktop there is a image that i want to use and i need to convert this to a photo image here's my desktop and this is an image that i want to use to add to my label i need to get the file path and i can get that by going to properties then underneath location i can copy this location address and paste it within the quotes for file and then i need to add the image name and this is person.png and with these backslashes these need to be double backslashes because that is the escape character for a backslash but what would be a better option is to add this image to my project folder that contains the python file that i'm working with so in place of listing the entire file path i'm going to copy the image that i want to use go to my project folder and then paste it and i no longer need this entire file path i can just list the image name that i have and now what we need to do is add this photo to the label and there's an option to do so that is the image option and we'll place this within the constructor for the label we're going to set image equal to the photo image that we have and our photo image is called photo this will add our photo image to our label or other widget depending on what we're working with so we have our image but it replaced all of the text that we had for this label how do we add both text and an image to a window well we can follow this with the compound option we can set a direction of where we want this image to be placed relative to the text that we have so i'm going to set compound equal to bottom so that the image appears on the bottom or underneath our text so we can both have text and an image or if i want this to be in a different location i could set this to maybe top left or right if i were to set this to top we have our image on top of our text and one thing to know about labels and many other widgets in python is that the size of the widget will actually increase to accommodate the size of all the components that's contained within if i were to give the text a longer string of characters such as bro do you even code then the width of our label is actually going to expand to accommodate the size of the longer string of text that we have so that's the basics of labels everyone if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of labels in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show buttons you click them and then they do stuff that's pretty much it so this is how to create a button in python we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop let's call our button just button and in order to create this we'll follow this with equals button and within the constructor for this button we're going to list what we want to add this button to what is the master the master is the window and in order to display this button we're going to follow this with button dot pack and we should have a small rectangular button within our window but it doesn't display any text nor does it do anything so let's add some text and there is an option to do that within the constructor we're going to list the option for text and set this to whatever text you want to display let's say click me and then when we run this our button now says the text that we set and it says click me however it currently doesn't do anything though we need to set a command that is another option command equals and we list a function name this is what's known as a callback so let's create a function called click and then outside of the window let's define what our click function does def click and let's print a message you clicked the button now with the command we're going to list the function name without the parentheses so make sure you're writing it as this and not that this is what's known as a callback so when we click on this button it's going to perform our callback and perform whatever is within our function click just like that let's customize the appearance of this button i'm going to change the font that is another option font equals and let's pick a professional font such as comic sans it's very professional and i'll set a size of 30. and now you can actually read what's on this button it's large enough let's set the foreground color that is the font color fg you can place a color name or a hex value here i'll pick green that is 0 0 ff00 and our text should now be green which it is let's also change the background color that is bg i will pick the color name of black and now we have green text on a black background notice that when i click on this button or hold my mouse button down the color scheme has changed that's because there is a different active foreground and active background and we can change those too so that this won't flash every time you click on the button so let's change the active foreground and active background those are other options active foreground and i'll set this to the same color as my foreground which is green so the text color is going to stay the same and i'll also change the active background and i will also set this to black to match my background and then this should no longer flash when we click on our button if you need to disable somebody from clicking on this button there is an option to do so and that option is the state option and normally this is active but you can set this to disabled and we can no longer click on this button and you can see that the color scheme has changed too it's all grayed out and whatnot so i'm going to replace this back with active because we still have a few more things to do now how do we add an image to a button there is an image option and we set this equal to a photo image but first we need to create a photo image i have this photo of a like button a thumbs up that i want to use i need to create a photo image from this image file so within the window let's call this photo image just photo photo equals photo image then i'm going to list the file path or the file name since this image is within my same project folder i only have to list the file name and this is called like.png but if you use your own image it's probably going to be named something else then i need to set the image equal to my photo image which i named photo but the photo replaces the text on this button but it still works the same so we would like to display some text as well as our image we need to use the compound option and we list a direction we can list top bottom left right we want this image to be on the perhaps bottom so let's list the bottom and now when we run this we have our text as well as our image and if we changed compound to a different direction like top then the image is going to be displayed on the top relative to the text what if we wanted to count the amount of times that we clicked this button we could create a variable called count and we'll set this equal to zero but in order for us to access this count variable within the function of click we're going to list count as global so that this is a global variable every time we click this button let's increment our variable count by one by saying count plus equals one and then we will print whatever the value of count is so within a print statement we'll just say count now when we click on this button we have access to our count variable that's outside of this function and every time we click on this button it's going to increase our count variable by one well everybody that's the basics of creating buttons in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of buttons in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a simple entry box in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright my fellow bros in this video we're going to be discussing the entry widget this is a text box that accepts a single line of user input as always we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and let's give our entry box a unique name let's call this entry for short and then to create this entry widget we're going to follow this with equals entry and within the constructor we have to state what we're adding this to we're going to add this to our window and we should finish this by packing it or placing it entry dot pack and we should have an entry box within our window however the text is somewhat small so let's change that we can set this as an option within the constructor of our entry box so let's set the font font equals and pick whatever font you want i'm going to pick maybe ariel and then a size it'd be 50. and this should be a little bit larger and we can type in some text like this cool right now we should add a submit button because right now this currently doesn't do anything if we type some text in so let's create a button i'm going to create this button maybe after the entry box and let's say that this is a submit button so let's call this submit button equals button what are we adding this to writing the square window and we'll set some text text equals submit we'll also need a command for this button command equals and we'll create a function called submit and we want to pack the submit button to add it to the window submit button.pack all right now let's put our entry box on the left hand side and our submit button on the right hand side when you pack these widgets you can set these on a certain side side equals left and our submit button we want this on the right not necessary but i think it looks better and we also need to define our submit function outside of the window let's define what this does def submit what's this going to do we need to get the current value that's within our entry box one way in which we can do that is use the entry boxes get function this will return a string and we can do something with that string such as store this within a variable so let's create a variable called maybe username let's pretend we're having a user submit their username to login to something i suppose so we'll get the current value of the entry box store that within a variable and we'll call this username and then we will maybe print this for fun print hello plus user name and let's try this so here's our entry box here and our submit button i'm just going to make up something click submit and it displays our message hello ergo gerger gerger i didn't say that this video was going to be professional let's add a few other buttons let's say we want a delete button as well as a backspace button so let's copy what we have for our submit button and create a delete button and then a backspace button the delete button is a little bit easier to code so let's rename our submit button as delete button make sure to change the name to when you pack this and the text we will say delete and we'll create a function called delete and let's define what delete does so after our submit function let's define our delete function and we need to delete all of the text within our entry box one way in which we can do that is to type in the name of our entry box dot delete function and this takes two positional arguments which portion of our entry box do we want to delete so we want the very first character that is index 0 followed by the last character and we can say end so this will delete all of the characters within our entry box and let's try it so i'm just going to type in my name bro i'm going to delete this and all of the text is now gone just like that let's create a backspace button we'll copy what we have for our delete button and change the word delete to backspace make sure you change that when you pack this as well and for the text we'll set this to backspace and we'll create a function called backspace and let's define what backspace does so after our delete function let's define back space and this is going to do something very similar to our delete function except we're going to change the first positional argument we need to place the second to last character within this positional argument one way in which we can do that is to first get the entire length of all of the characters within our entry box so let's begin by typing entry dot get and we need to determine the length of this and we can surround this by placing this within the length function so this will return the current length of all of the characters within our entry box and then we're going to add -1 so that this first positional argument is the second to last character and the second positional argument is the end the last character and then when we run this let's type in our name i'm just going to type in draw code this time i'm going to click backspace and then it's only going to delete the last character and then if you were to click delete it deletes everything broy and then if you click submit it's going to submit your name all right let's customize the appearance of this entry box so within the constructor for this entry box let's change maybe the color maybe the background color and foreground color let's begin with the foreground color you can pass in a color name or a hex value i want this to be green so the hex value for that is zero zero f zero ff00 and the foreground color of the text when we type it in is now green and we can also change the background color that is bg we could pass in a color name or a hex value i'm just going to say black to keep it simple and we now have a black background and the text color is now green here's a few useful features that you might be interested in let's insert some default text for our entry box so we can use the insert function entry dot insert we place a positional argument as well as some text so for the positional argument let's say zero so that's the very beginning index zero and let's set the text to maybe spongebob and then the default text within our entry box is now spongebob another option available to us is that we can set the state of this entry box we can set this to active or disabled let's say that after somebody submits our name we want to disable this entry box so we can either pass in this option within our constructor or we can use the config function to make any changes to the state of our entry box so let's say after we submit our username we want to disable this entry box so let's type in the name of our entry box dot config and for the option for state let's set this to disabled and then once we type in a name and then click submit our entry box is now disabled there's also an option called show where you can show a certain character in place of the normal text on the screen so this would be useful for a password let's say that we're typing in a password but we don't want to display the password on the screen we can use the show option to show a certain character in place of our text so you might see bullets or an asterisk so let's pretend that we're now typing in a password so we're going to set the option for show and place a character that we want to replace each character with let's say we want to only display asterisks when we type in some characters and i'm going to type in the word password but it's only displaying asterisks now but if i were to click submit it displays our text and i would say plain text instead of our hidden text because we're only showing whatever character that we set so that's an option available to you as well well everybody that's how to create an entry box in python you can submit information such as a username for example or even a password if you set the show option available to you if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's some of the uses of the entry widget in python hey how's it going everybody two bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create and customize our own check buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right my fellow bros in this video we're going to be creating and customizing our own check buttons in python i sometimes refer to these as check boxes so in case i do that's what i'm referring to as always we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and let's call this button just check button and in order to create this check button we type in the name of the check button equals check button and within the constructor what are we adding this check button to we're adding this to our window and also within the constructor we can set the different options for how we want to customize this check button let's begin with the text text equals i agree to something and last but not least we need to add this check button to the window one way in which we can do that is to use the pack function of this widget so follow this with check button dot pack when we run this we have our check button within our window and we can toggle this on or off right now i'm agreeing to something i'm not sure what i'm agreeing to but hopefully it's not anything bad now currently this doesn't do anything so we'll need to associate a variable with this check button so we'll add that as an option variable equals and let's create a variable called x and we'll need to define this within the window so after we create our instance of our window let's say x equals now with check buttons they store a 1 or a 0 by default within our variable our variable that we call x so with x we're going to set this equal to a int var if this were to return a string we would say string bar but normally by default this returns a one or a zero and we can actually change that using the on value and off value options so the on value is what's going to be stored within our variable if it's toggled on so by default this is one and the off value is the opposite this is what is stored within our variable if this is toggled off alright now let's have some fun with this so let's associate a command with this check button command equals and let's create a function called maybe display and then let's define this before the window def display and we're going to check the value of x to see if it's one or zero so within our display function we're going to check to see if x and to get the value of x we're going to use the get function so if x dot get is equal to one that means that somebody clicked on the check box or toggled it on so if they check the check box or check the check button then they agree so print you agree if it's zero and we can do this with an else statement else print you don't agree frowny face and let's test this theory so we have our check button when we click on this it's actually going to call our display function i agree to something and it says within our console window you agree and if i were to toggle this off it says you don't agree let's change the font of our check button so we'll add that as an option font equals and we can pass in a font that we want i'll say maybe ariel and then a size of 20 and now this should be readable i agree to something let's also color this because well i like coloring let's begin with the foreground color so that is fg for short fg equals and then we can pass in a color name or a hex value i like hex values so i'm going to stick with those i want a green foreground color so that is zero zero f zero zero but feel free to adjust these values however you want so our text should now be green that is a very bright green and it hurts my eyes so i'm also going to change the background color which is bg and i'm going to set this to black so we'll have green text on a black background okay now when you click on this it flashes that's kind of annoying that's the active foreground and active background if we click on this or hold this down the color scheme switches to our active foreground slash background and we can change those too so i'm going to set those options active foreground i'm going to set this the same as my foreground color and the active background will be the same as our normal background so that's active background equals black and this should no longer flash when we click on it not too bad not too bad let's add some padding pad x i'll set this to 25 and pad y i'll set this to 10. we have a little more padding around our check button one feature that's available to us is that we can add an image next to our check button i downloaded an image of the python logo that i want to add so we'll use the image option to add a photo image to this check button but first we need to create a photo image from our image file so within the window let's call this python photo but you'll probably use something different for your project python photo equals photo image and within the constructor for our photo image we can set the file path or the file name since this image is within my project folder i only have to list the file name and this photo of mine is python.png and now we set the image equal to our photo image that we have image equals python photo but when we run this it's going to overlap the text we still have our image though and this still works as intended so in order to display the image as well as the text we're going to need to use the compound option and let's add that at the end compound is where we're adding this photo relative to the text i want this photo on the left hand side of the text so i'm going to set this to left and now when we run this surprise surprise our image is on the left hand side one thing that you should know is that with the on value and the off value data type if you were to change this to a non-integer value let's say we're going to replace the on value with a boolean value of true and the off value is false with this variable make sure to change the data type as well to reflect what you're storing within it so with our int var variable we want to change this to a boolean var value so replace int with boolean and this will work much the same now with this display function we'll need to account for that so within the if statement here we'll say if x dot get we don't need to say is equal to one this will return true or false and this will work just the same as it did before and if you replace this with a string let's say the on value is yes all caps and the off value is no this is now a string bar and we'll change our display function to say if x dot get is equal to yes and this should work you agree you don't agree you agree you don't agree and i'll change that back to one so one and zero is the default for this but you can edit these based on what you need all right so that's the basics of check buttons in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of check buttons in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to be teaching you guys how we can create radio buttons in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay everybody let's create some radio buttons now these are similar to check boxes but you can only select one from any single grouping so let's pretend that i'm buying you lunch and you can only select one item from a menu you can select either a slice of pizza a hamburger or a hot dog so let's begin by creating a list i will call this list food food equals pizza hamburger hot dog and let's create a window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop so to create a radio button we'll need a name so i'll call this radio button radio button equals radio button and we're going to be adding this to our window and we're going to put this within a for loop so we're going to iterate through all of the items within our list so let's create a for loop so we'll say for index in range length of food so this is going to iterate once through all of the elements within our list so when we run this it's going to create three radio buttons for us because we're instantiating one radio button for each item in the list now what i'm going to do is set the text equal to our list of food at a certain index so when we first run this for loop it's going to be zero for the index then one and then two and then so on and so forth for each item within our list and then we just need to pack this so radio button dot pack and then let's take a look at this alright so here are all of the radio buttons that we have currently they're all selected though so we'll need to link these within a single grouping the next thing we'll add is a variable and we'll set this equal to x and we'll need to declare this after we create an instance of our window so x equals int var so this will hold an integer object so these are all within the same grouping however if we try to run this again and select one of these options they all become selected so we're going to need to give each of these individual radio buttons their own value because right now they're all sharing the same value so we can add value equals whatever the index is currently so the first item within our list of food is going to have an index value of zero then one then two so let's try that again and you can see by default it's zero so pizza is already selected then we can select either hamburger or hot dog but we can only select one so that's kind of what we want then so do you guys usually know how i call the config function after each change that i make for an object well that's because i like to add comments just for teaching purposes for what each change does however it might be easier for you instead of calling the config function a bunch of times just to list all of the changes within the parentheses when you create an instance of the object that you're working with however just for teaching purposes i'm going to put this all within separate lines that allows me to add some comments so i think i'm going to start doing that from now on uh so what this does is that this adds text to radio buttons and this groups radio buttons together if they share the same variable so if you wanted a completely different grouping of radio buttons you can give them a different variable like y and what this line does is that this assigns each radio button a different value all right so let's make some cosmetic changes to our radio buttons so right now they are centered let's anchor these to the west so we'll place this within the pack function so anchor equals w alternatively you can just say capital w without the quotes this would also work too so now they're all lined up let's add some padding so i'm going to add pad x and i'll set this to 25 and this adds padding on x axis let's also change the font so we'll save font equals maybe i'll pick impact for a font style and set the font size to 50 and now we can actually read these because the font is large enough now let's add some images so let's create some photo images you'll want to be sure to create these after you create your instance of your window so let's create a pizza image first pizza image equals photo image file equals the file path or the file name and my file is pizza.png and it kind of looks like this it's just the pizza emoji so pizza.png and then i'll do the same thing for hamburger and hotdog so this will be hamburger image file equals hamburger.png and then hotdog image and this is what the other emojis look like and then let's create a list of the photo images that we have i'll call this food images equals than the names of these images pizza image hamburger image and hot dog image so then we can set the image for each radio button image equals the name of the list food images followed by the index that we're currently on within our for loop so this adds image to radio button and let's test this cool here's our images now if you want some images as well as text you'll have to use compound so let's add that next so i'm just going to add a comma followed by compound equals let's say left so this will add the image to the left of the text adds image and text i'll just say left side so this will display both an image and text so with these radio buttons you can eliminate these circle indicators and there's actually a way to do that so what we'll add if you want to get rid of those is indicator on equals zero so this will i should say eliminate circle indicators so it's going to change these to these push buttons however they are going to be of uneven size you can set the width if you want to so we'll do that so we'll say width equals what about 75 i'm not sure if that's a good size or not okay that's way too small let's try 375 so yeah you can have some push buttons if you want to if you don't like the circle indicators so this sets width of radio buttons now let's actually set a function to uh be called when we click one of these buttons so let's call this function maybe order like we're ordering one of these items so def we'll call this order like we're ordering something and what we'll do is just a few if statements because i'm feeling lazy so we'll just say if x that's the value that's going to be stored because each of these radio buttons is grouped together by the variable x if x dot get is equal to zero that's our first index for pizza what we'll display is print you oops you ordered pizza then we'll just add else if x dot get is equal to one we will print you ordered a hamburger and then else if two you ordered a hot dog else print huh so there's probably a more efficient way to write this however i was just feeling lazy and this is probably the best way to keep this simple and easy to understand so let's try this now oh however we need to set the command for our radio buttons so command equals then the function name which is order and make sure you do not add the parentheses so don't do this do that and this will set command of radio button to function all right let's test this so if we click on pizza it says you ordered pizza you ordered a hamburger and you ordered a hot dog okay everybody so that's the basics of radio buttons if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of radio buttons in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a sliding scale in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show let's create a scale so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.mainloop we'll create a scale called scale scale equals scale we need to add the scale to our window so we'll put that here we can list a from position and a 2 position both of these values will be our range of values that we can use for our scale so from sure to add an underscore after from it won't work without this underscore from equals let's say 0 and 2 equals 100 so we're going to create a scale for temperature and this will be in celsius so 0 will be freezing and 100 will be the boiling point uh you know for water so then to display the scale we'll need to add scale.pack and let's run this so the front position is zero so that's at the top here and then if you go down it increases so you can actually flip this so we'll save from 102 will be zero so now you can scroll up and the number will increase let's also get the current value so we'll need a button so button equals button we'll add this to the window we'll add some text text equals submit and then a command command equals submit but we'll have to make this function so let's do that outside the window def submit and we will simply print the current temperature so let's display message the temperature is plus scale dot get plus degrees celsius we can just say degree c so let's try this uh but we also have to pack the button so button.pack so if we were to try and submit this right now scale.get is going to return an integer so we need to convert this to a string so str scale.get and you have to do that with python if you're displaying a integer value along with another string uh you need to convert it to a string so now this should work so it is 82 degrees celsius so let's do some cosmetic changes for our temperature gauge because right now it's kind of ugly so the first thing we'll change is let's say the length so length equals 600 so that should be fairly large you can also set the orientation so that is orient spelt like that so this can either be vertical which it currently is or horizontal but i'll keep this as vertical so i'll let a comment that this is orientation of scale let's also change the font so font equals pick whatever font you want and a size so maybe 20. now you can add some tick intervals maybe i'll set this to 10. so these will be numeric indicators on the scale and show value this hides the current value so if you set this to zero this will hide current value so it no longer displays what the current value is next to the slider to actually retrieve it you'd have to get the value so right now it's 40 but it helps that you have the tick intervals on the left-hand side i should probably add that this adds uh numeric indicators for value good enough let's continue on now let's use the set function we can set the current value of the knob on our scale and by default it is zero so we can use the scale dot set function and we can place a number in here a value so let's say we want this to be 100 so this is now at the 100 position instead of zero if we wanted this in the middle we could set this to 50 and now it's in the middle however if you change the range of your skill of from minus 2 and set this to 50 now 50 is all the way down here so it no longer appears in the middle so this isn't really necessary but if you want this to be a little more sophisticated there's actually a formula that you could use we can use scale straight braces and then place the word from within here this will give us our max basically uh so this is from without an underscore so this not this this scale from minus scale two and then we're going to divide this by two and then i'm just going to put this within a extra set of parentheses plus scale two just in case our two value is greater than zero we just want to account for that and then i'm just going to put these within another set of parentheses so this should always appear in the middle then even if we were to change this range yeah it seems like it works uh like i said it's not really necessary but if you want this to be a little more sophisticated that would work now let's make some cosmetic changes to this scale and make it look pretty so first let's change the trough color this is this gray portion right here so let's set the trough color equals whatever color you want you could say like blue or you can place a hex value here and i actually picked one out already so i'm going to use 6 9 e a f f and that is this icy blue color kind of like this is sliding on ice and i'm also going to change the font color and i'm going to pick this fiery red color to symbolize heat and then you can change the background color too so that is bg and i'll just set this to like black it's looking kind of cool now right and for no good reason i'm going to add some pictures so feel free to pause the video if you'd like to download some images i'm going to use an image of a flame for the hot side of our scale and a snowflake for the cold side so let's begin by adding the hot image uh to the scale before we actually add the scale to the window so we'll do this after we instantiate the window because that's the only place that we can do that so we're going to create a image i'll just call this hot image for the fire icon so hot image equals photo image file equals this is hot.png so hot.png we're going to add the image to a label i'll call this hot label hot label label image equals hot image and then we need to pack this so hot label dot pack and this should appear at the top let's test it yep there it is let's do the same thing for the cold side so i'll add this here before the button and i'm going to replace hot with cold same thing with the file name cold.png this will be cold label cold image and cold label dot pack and that should be it let's take a look not too shabby it's looking pretty sweet it has our submit button at the bottom too uh so right now the temperature is 100 degrees celsius the temperature is 0 degrees celsius the temperature is 60 degrees celsius well that's how to create a scale in python if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to create a scale in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a list box in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right you wonderful people let's create a list box a list box is a listing of selectable text items within its own container so as always we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop let's create a list box simply called list box big surprise there right so list box equals list box what are we adding this list box to we're going to place that here within the parentheses of the constructor we're adding this to our window and then we're going to follow this with listbox.pack you can also do listbox.place as well and place some coordinates but we've always done pack let's just stick with that for now all right so this is what our list box looks like it's a small rectangular box and we're going to add some text items that are selectable and eventually we'll be able to submit a choice so i have an idea let's create an online menu like we're ordering food from a restaurant let's say it's bros italian restaurant so let's add some food items to our menu and somebody can submit an order so we'll need to use the insert function of the list box to add some items so list box dot insert we place an index and a text item so let's say for index one we'll have pizza and this is what we end up with we have the item pizza it's selectable and well that's really it we'll need to create a submit button and populate the rest of this list box so let's add a few other items for our menu so let's say we'll have five items and we need an index for each so one two three four and five so we have pizza for the first item for the second item let's have pasta and third let's say garlic bread because garlic bread is awesome and restaurants usually have appetizers so why not soup and salad and that should be enough for this example and this is what we have we have our menu and we can select an item from this menu so let's customize the appearance of this menu well because we can so let's do that let's change the background color so we do that with the option bg for background and you can set this equal to a color of your choice or a hex value so i have a hex color value already picked out it is f7fde and this has the appearance of i would say paper like it's kind of faded i think that would fit some sort of menu for a restaurant but pick whatever background color you want so let's change the font next so we can do that with the option font and i will pick the font it's somewhat fancy i think it would fit like a restaurant menu and then a size of 35. yeah we're getting somewhere we can also change the width and the height so width equals let's say 12. that's not too bad for a width let's also change the height so we can do that with a function of our list box so let's get the current size of the list box and let's actually do that after we insert all of the items within our list box so to change the size of our list box what we do is type in list box dot config you usually use config if you need to change any uh options and we want to change the length of or the height of this list box so we're going to say height equals list box dot size function so then this will adjust the size of our list box dynamically even if we were to remove an item then the size of our list box is going to shrink just like that but let's keep salad in there for now because we need salad all right so how do we actually submit one of these options we'll need to create a submit button so let's do that after we create our list box so near the bottom we'll call this submit button submit button equals button we're adding this to our window let's set the text to submit and we'll need a command so we'll create a function called submit and then we need to pack this submit button submit button.pack now at the top of this program let's create a submit function so at the top def submit so to retrieve or get the current selected item of a list box there is a certain function that you can use so we'll begin by saying list box dot get what are we getting we want to get anything that is currently selected and there is a function for that so what we're going to do within the parentheses of the get function is type in listbox dot current selection it's shortened to cur selection all right and then we can either store this within a variable or we can just print this but i think we'll just print this to keep it simple now when we select an item and click on the submit button it's going to submit our order actually better yet let's actually uh print you have ordered whatever item that we select so garlic bread you have ordered garlic bread cool what we're going to work on now is a way to submit or insert an item to our list box after this program is compiled and already running so we'll create an entry box within our window where we can submit a custom item to this menu so let's create an entry box and let's do that before the submit button that would be a good spot for this so let's call this entry box where somebody can type in something to add to the menu so entry box equals entry and we're adding this to our window and then entry box dot pack then we're going to create a button called add and i'm just going to copy everything from the submit button and we'll change submit to add we're going to add an item to the menu so we'll change the text to add and command add add button dot pack then we're going to create a function called add and we'll do that at the top def add parentheses colon so to add an item to the list box first we need to get what is currently in the entry box so we can do that by typing in list box dot insert then within the parentheses we need to get an index number as well as a text item so for the number what we can type here is the listbox dot size so this will give us the current position of the index that we're currently on for the list box and then we need to get the text in the entry box so we type in the name of the entry box entry box dot get and this will insert a new item within our menu our list box so let's try it again so we can type in an item let's say soda we want to add soda to the menu and then we click add all right there's our soda but we have to scroll down to see it so let's change the size of our list box so there's actually a line of code that we did that already listbox.config height equals listbox size so let's add that within the add function at the very end so then the height of our list box will adjust so currently there's no soda within our menu let's type in soda or some other item click add and then that item will appear and the size of the list box will change to accommodate any new items let's say now that we serve sushi we're now an italian and japanese restaurant now we have sushi on the menu you know what why stop there let's create a delete button to delete an item from this menu so we'll create a delete button i'll just copy everything for add and change this to delete so delete button text equals delete command equals delete as well and delete button dot pack and then at the very top we'll create a delete function so we'll do that here d e f delete and to delete an item from a list box there's actually a function to do that so list box dot delete and then within the parenthesis of the delete function we can pass in list box dot current selection or just cur selection for short and then we want to readjust the height of this list box after we delete an item so we'll just add listbox.config height equals listbox.size because the size of all the items within the list box is going to shrink after we delete an item so let's try this so here's our menu let's say we no longer want salad because salad is healthy well we can delete it same thing with soup and you know what let's also delete the pasta and the pizza so we're only left with sweet sweet garlic bread well ladies and gentlemen we're going to get into some more advanced stuff with list boxes what if you want to select more than one item from this list box we're going to need to change a few things so when we create our list box there is a select mode select mode and we are going to set this equal to multiple so now we can actually select multiple items from this list box like i want to select one of everything but what happens when we submit this well we're going to run into some problems so we're going to need to change this program around so let's begin with the submit option so what we're going to do within the submit option is first get rid of this line let's say we no longer need this anymore uh and then before we print out the items that we ordered let's create a list called food and we'll just leave this empty for now we'll fill this later so we'll create a for loop for index in list box dot current selection what we're going to do after each iteration food dot insert our index number as well as listbox dot get the item name at this index what this for loop is doing is that it's going to iterate once for each item that we select so since we have three items that are currently selected this is going to iterate three times get the index number as well as the item at that index number and now we just need to display the contents of what we have within our list of food so we can do that with another for loop so let's add that after you have ordered then for index in our list food all we'll do is print index so this will print out everything that we ordered so let's say that we want one of everything and submit this you have ordered pizza pasta garlic bread soup and salad now what happens if we try to delete multiple items so let's say we want to delete soup and salad and we click delete well we're going to run into an error because our function is not set up to accommodate for multiple items so we'll need to change a few things around so let's get rid of this line for now list box dot delete list box dot current selection and we're going to place a for loop here so for index in list box dot current selection then after each iteration what we're going to do is use list box dot delete and we're deleting the item at whatever index we're currently on so you would think this would work at first glance let's say we want to delete pizza and pasta we're going to click delete so pizza was deleted but not pasta that's because the indexes are changing after we delete an item so when we use this for loop we should actually reverse this so with listbox.currentselection we are going to enclose this with reversed so then we're going to start at the last index and work our way to zero in that order so now if we want to delete pizza and pasta i don't know why we would because they're amazing and we click delete it deletes pizza and pasta but we still have garlic bread soup and salad then we can add an item let's say we want to add sushi against the menu we can do that and then we can order one of everything because we're really hungry you have ordered garlic bread soup salad and sushi so that's the basics of creating a list box in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of list boxes in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create message boxes in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay people let's create some message boxes but first we'll need an import so from tk enter import message box and what this will do is import the message box library so it's not necessary to add this comment uh so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop let's create a button so button equals button we're going to add this to the window we're going to set the command to execute a click function that will have a message box appear when we click on the button and let's set the text so text equals click me and then we will need to pack this button so button.pack now we'll need to create a click function so let's do that at the top def click and what do we want to do so there's a few different uh message dialog boxes that you can use so let's begin with a basic show info message box so message box dot and there's a few options let's begin with show info show info this just displays a simple message so if we were to run this we have a button we click on the button and it's going to create a message box for us and it just shows some info but we don't really have any info to show yet so we can set a title and we can set a message so let's set the title title equals this is an info message box although part of the title got cut off let's also set the message message equals you are a person click me you are a person thanks i didn't know that so there's a few other message boxes that we can use too so for now i'm just going to turn this into a comment and i'll just copy this just to save some time and the next one that we have is show warning so this will have a different icon so the title let's say warning and the message you have a virus so now we get this annoying warning message but you can just click ok to get rid of it so one thing that you might see with tech support scams they'll have a message box like this that shows a warning but they'll put this within a while loop that's set to true so this will just continue on and on kind of like this so if we were to try and close out of this it's just going to reappear while true is true basically so that's just something funny that i wanted to show you so let's move on i'm going to turn this into a comment then the next one we have is show error so show error title set it to whatever you want error message something went wrong there's a few more sophisticated ones too we can ask for some user input so this next one is message box dot ask and there's a few to choose from let's go with ask okay cancel first we'll set the title title equals ask okay cancel and a message message do you want to do the thing so we can actually put this within an if statement so this returns either true or false depending on what you click so let's put this within an if statement if this is true print you did a thing if it returns false we can use an else statement else what else do we want to do we'll say else print you cancelled a thing and let's test this but i am forgetting a colon there do you want to do the thing okay you did a thing let's try it again do you want to do the thing cancel you cancelled a thing cool there's a few others so i'll turn all of these into comments and the next one we can go over is ask retry cancel and this is fairly similar to what we had before i'm going to copy this let's change this to ask retry cancel ask retry cancel do you want to retry the thing you retried a thing or you cancelled a thing so it's very similar to what we had before do you want to retry the thing retry you retried a thing and cancel you cancelled a thing okay the next one we have is ask yes no so we can get some user input if it's a yes or a no so this returns a boolean value a true or false value so message box dot ask yes no and we'll set the title title equals ask yes or no and a message do you like cake so let's put this within an if statement because this returns a true or false answer print i like cake too else they answered no then if this is false print why do you not like cake and i'm missing a colon there we go so if they click yes this returns true and we execute this line of code i like cake too if they answer no it's going to execute this else statement do you like cake no why do you not like cake now what we have next is ask question and this doesn't return a boolean value of true or false it actually returns a string of yes or no so this is message box dot ask question and we'll set the title to ask question and a message message equals do you like pi so let's just print the result what this returns so print everything within here so like i said this doesn't return it true or false but yes or no so what we could do is assign the response to a variable such as answer so answer equals whatever the answer is whatever they click whatever button they click on so if our answer is equal to yes will print a message print i like pie 2. then else the answer is no will print why do you not like pie so do you like pie yes i like pie too do you like pie no why do you not like pie so this next one is probably the most difficult it's ask yes no cancel so it's message box dot ask yes no cancel it's this last one so let's set the title title equals whatever you want yes no cancel and a message message equals do you like to code so let's just print the results what this returns so print everything just so we can take a look so the possible answers are true false or none so we can just run some if statements for this so if answer is equal to true what we can do is print you like to code oh but we need to assign this to an answer so answer equals all of this else if answer is equal to false let's print then why are you watching a video on coding and then else the response is none so we can just use an else statement so else you have dodged the question okay let's try this do you like to code yes you like to code uh but this should really be a smiley face right do you like to code no then why are you watching a video on coding do you like to code cancel you have dodged the question no one other option available to you is that you can change the icon that you're using so let's say that we want to change this icon so right now it is currently this question mark so we can set this to one of a few preset icons so icon equals and let's set this to warning so instead of that question mark we get this yellow exclamation point and you can also use info it's just an eye and error so do it fits best for you all right well that's the basics on message boxes in python if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of message boxes in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about the color chooser module in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay everybody so before we begin it we'll need a second import so let's add this at the top so from tk enter import color chooser and the reason that we need a second import and it's not included with this first import is because this is a sub module it's not necessary to add this comment i just like to add comments for teaching purposes so make sure you have these two imports before we begin now we'll need a window and a button that we can add to the window and when we click on the button we're going to select a color and change the background color of the window so let's create a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and then let's set the geometry so we're going to change the background color of the window after we select a color so let's select a fairly large size for a window maybe 420 by 420 so this is the width and the height and then let's create a button so button equals button let's set some text text equals click me and we're going to set a command for this button that is called so we're going to create a function maybe called click and then we just need to pack this button so we can add this to the window so button.pack now we're going to need to create a function and we'll call it click so when we click on the button this function is going to be called so def click and what do we want to do after clicking this button what we're going to do is take color chooser and we're going to use the ask color function so currently this is what this does we can select a color after clicking this button and pick whatever color you want then you hit ok however we need to store this color within let's say a variable so we'll create a variable called color color equals color chooser dot ask color and then we can do something with this color but for now let's just print this color just to take a look to see what it contains so print color so let's say that i want this green color click ok this is what this prints this is our color so this is the rgb values that we have in this first element so this is the amount of red then green and then blue and the second element is the hexadecimal representation of these values so what we want is this hexadecimal value so what we can do is create a second variable to store this so let's just call this color hex color hex equals color and we're going to get the first element well technically it's the second element but it's the element at position one so this one this is zero index zero so we're going to basically extract this hexadecimal value and let's just print this just to be sure that it's working fine so print color hex and let's try this again but select a different color uh maybe i want this purple color then click ok so this is cb42ff and here we have cb42ff now let's change the background color so since we have this hex value that's actually fairly simple so we're going to take window dot config bg for background color equals color hex and this will change background color and let's set this to a sky blue color maybe like this click ok and it changes the color however it's not really necessary to continue printing these values you can take these out if you want and this would work like just the same then now this part isn't necessary but if you want you can condense these three lines of code that we have for our click function into less lines of code so what you could do instead of assigning the value of color at index 1 to a separate variable we can take color at index 1 get rid of this line and assign bg equals color at index one so now this is done with just two lines of code and why stop there we can write this with just one line of code so now we're going to take color chooser dot ask color get rid of this line bg equals color chooser dot ask color at index one and now this is done with just one line of code however it's a i would say a little more difficult to teach so that's why i kind of like to separate this line by line so if you want you can condense all of this into just one line of code so here's some ideas of where the color chooser sub module could be helpful so of course you can change the background color too but let's say that you're creating a game and you can customize your character or avatar well it would be kind of nice if you could have some way for the user to actually change maybe the character's hair color eye color something like this would actually work fairly well so yeah that's the basics of color chooser if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post this in the comments down below but that's the basics of color chooser in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a text area in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right my fellow bros let's discuss the text widget this functions like a text area you can enter multiple lines of text i'm not sure why it's called a text widget instead of a text area widget text area would make more sense but idk though so let's begin by creating a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop so to create a text widget also known as a text area let's call this text text equals text and we're going to add this text to our window and then we need to pack this text text dot pack so we should have a text area and you can enter in stuff like this all right but what good is a text area if you can't actually submit some text so let's create a button to do that for us so button equals button we're going to add this button to the window and button dot pack so we need a command for this button and a function as well so let's create a function called submit it's going to be a submit button and let's change the text to because we can text equals submit cool now let's create a function called submit and we'll do this at the top d e f submit and what is this going to do well it's going to get the text from the text area and let's assign this to a variable and we can call this maybe input or whatever you want so to get the text from the text area let's say text that's the name of this text area dot get but we need a starting index as well as an ending index so we're going to place 1.0 here for the beginning index this is the first line we want to get everything so for the second index we can just put end then we can do anything we want with this input so let's just print this to the console window so print input and this should work hey you drink plenty of water love you and click submit and then you can do whatever you want with this input well that's how a text area functions but now let's customize the appearance of this text area and i have a few ideas that you might be interested in so let's change the background color of this text area so bg equals and i will pick light yellow and you will see why in just a second so now this text area kind of resembles maybe a piece of paper a notebook a post-it note however this font is really small so let's change the font styling and the font size so font equals and i will pick the font ink free this somewhat resembles handwriting so i kind of like this and it kind of fits our notebook theme and then a size maybe 25. one thing you should know the text area size corresponds directly with the font size so 25 is a fairly large font so if we were to compile this and run this the size of our text area is now massive because it corresponds directly with the font size so we might want to limit the width and the height so the height is the amount of characters that this is tall so let's say 8 and the width is the amount of characters that this is long and let's say 20. and now this should be much smaller and it kind of resembles a post-it note which is kind of cool let's also change the amount of padding that we have we can do that with pad x and pad y so pad x let's say 20 and pad y also 20. so the text shouldn't actually touch any of the borders this is some sample text cool let's finish this by changing the font color so that is fg for foreground foreground equals and i'll pick purple because purple is a pretty color and let's run this one last time roses are red violets are blue booty booty booty booty rockin everywhere well that's the basics of the text widget in python if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the text widget in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use a file dialog in python to open and read the contents of a file so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay people so this is how you can use file dialog to open and read the contents of a file but first we'll need a second import along with this import at the top so what we're going to be importing is from tk enter import file dialog and then we'll need a window like what we usually do so window equals tk followed by window dot main loop now we'll need a button that we're going to add to the window and when we click on this button it's going to launch our file dialog so we can select a file so we'll call this button button equals button let's set some text maybe to just open like we're opening a file and we'll associate a function to our command for this button so let's create a function called open file that's fine and then we need to pack this button so we can add it to the screen so button.pack now we need to create a function called open file and we'll do this before we create our window let's type def open file and when we call this function we're going to take file dialog and use the ask open file name function so this is going to return a string and that string is the file path of where your file is located so what we could do is store this within a variable so let's store this within a variable called file path and to test this let's just print this just to take a look at the contents of this variable so let's just print the file path now i have a file on my desktop that i want to use called test file so let's click the open button and this might not necessarily bring you to your desktop it might bring you someplace else within your file directory so this just happens to be bring me to my desktop so i'm going to click the test file that i have and click open so this prints the file path so it's going to return a string and it's the file path basically so now we want to open and read the contents of this file so we don't really need this print line anymore so what we'll do is create a file variable and we're going to use open we're going to list the file path and then we're going to use r for read so the default is normally rt for read text otherwise you can read binary uh but we can just set this to r r is the same as rt basically uh so then we're going to open this file and then we're going to read it so let's just print this to the console window so print the name of the file which is file where this is located file dot read function and then it's a good idea to close your files after you're done with them so file dot close and let's test this so i'm going to click open find the file that i want click it and then open and that text file says my name is bro i like pizza now let's say you want to make this a little more advanced so what i'm going to do is that i'm going to set the initial directory of where we begin looking for a file when we launch our file dialog so with that test file i'm going to move this to my project folder so i'm just going to paste it so now this is within my project folder now i'm going to set the initial directory within the function of ask open file name so we're going to set the initial d i r for initial directory and then we can list a file path so one thing you could do i want to get this path here this file path so if you're using pycharm what you could do is right click this copy path and then get the absolute path and then i'm just going to paste this and then uh with these backslashes you'll have to do double backslashes because this is the escape character for a backslash alright so this should open my project folder which it does and here's that test file another thing we could do is that we can change the title of our file dialog right now the default is just open so we can change that to something else so i'm going to add a comma maybe put this on a different line uh so this is still within the function of ask open file name so i'm going to set the title to something else i'll say open file okay so if we were to run this again instead of just saying open it says open file okay and we can also limit the file types that we accept and look for so we can use file types so let's say that we want to initially look for a txt file so what we'll do is type in like a name for the file that we're looking for so this is what's going to appear to the user uh text files followed by an extension so we want asterisk dot txt and then we can also have an option for all files so i'm going to add a comma for a second option and then let's say all files and then an extension so comma asterisk dot asterisk this will look for all files uh but i think i am missing a parenthesis there that should be good so then when we open our file dialog it's going to initially be looking for plain text files and with this drop down menu it says text files and all files so that's what we have listed within our file types of what we want to search for so you can see that if i switch to all files our python file actually appears because we don't have any limits on the files that we're trying to open or search for so if i change this back to text files only folders and plain text files are visible so then we can open our test file again but yeah that's the basics of file dialog in the next video we're going to be saving a file so if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of opening a file using python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use python's file dialog to save a file someplace on your computer so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay everybody so this is how we can save a file we're going to be reusing a file dialog again kind of like what we did with the video on opening and reading a file so from tk enter import file dialog we're going to be creating a window and adding a button as well as a text area to this window so let's create our window window equals tk followed by window.main loop let's create a button so button equals button let's set the text of the button so text equals save it's going to be a save button and then a command so we'll need to link a function to this command so let's create a save file function and then we need to pack this button so button dot pack now let's create a text area this is just called text so text equals text we're going to add this to the window and we need to pack this text so text dot pack and now let's create a save file function so at the top of our program d e f save file and then we're going to take file dialog and use the ask save as file function and we're going to store the contents within file file equals file dialog dot ask save as file let's run this just to test it out so we have our window a save button and this is our text area we can type in multiple lines of text yay and let's try and save this just to see what we have so far so this will bring me to my desktop it might bring you someplace else for your computer so i'm just going to save this as test file now with this drop down menu save as type there's nothing set up so we'll need to do that manually uh if we were to save this and here's that test file on my desktop so let's take a look at the properties we did not list a file extension so the type of file just says file so we'll get to that later on in this video and if we were to open this with a program like notepad well it's currently empty that's because we need to write some text to this file so let's do that next let's store all of the text from our text area to a variable let's call this variable file text file text equals and then we need to get all of the text from our text area so text dot get and we're going to list the starting index as well as the ending index for this function so we're going to begin at 1.0 that is the beginning of this text area and the ending we can just put end and then we need to convert all of this into a string so let's surround this with str and then we can store all of the text from our text area within this variable file text and now we just need to write our text to this file so file dot write and we're going to pass in file text and then it's a good idea to close your files when you're done using them so file dot close and let's try this again hello my name is bro let's save this i'll call this hello and click save and we still can't save s-type so we'll work on that next let's go to my desktop here's the test file that we created i'm going to open this with notepad and it has all of the text that we added to that text area now let's list some available file extensions that we can have the user save this file as so let's begin by setting the default extension so default extension and let's set this to a text file that is dot txt and then we can list all of the available file types so file types and we're going to place these within a set of straight brackets and i'll just separate these line by line so let's begin with a plain text file so this will take two strings the first is the message that will appear within that save as type drop down menu so let's place text file and the second string the file extension and that is dot txt then let's add another let's say html so i'm going to copy this and paste it and let's say html next dot html and then lastly you can do just all files so all files and that is dot asterisk and let's try this again so hello my name is bro i like pizza and ice cream and this time i think i'll save this as an html file and this is we'll call this pizza and ice cream i guess and click save now let's go back to my desktop here's that file pizza and ice cream and it is an file let's just verify that yep.html for the type of file so we can open this with notepad and it has all of the text i could even open this with sublime text as well kind of like that all right let's change the initial directory for saving a file let's change it to my project folder for uh this python file that we have so that is and i'm just going to organize this a little bit initial d i r equals and then we can list a file path so i'm just going to copy this so copy path paste it then i want to make sure that these are double backslashes and i need to add a comma at the end okay let's try this again so testing one two three and this should go to my project folder which it does testing123 and let's save this as a plain text file click save and here's that plain text file testing123 another option available to you is that you don't necessarily need to use a text area to get some text to write to a file you could use the console window to accept some text so to demonstrate this i'm going to turn this line into a comment and we're instead going to use the console window this time so we'll say file text equals input and then let's just have a prompt here enter some text i guess and then let's run this again so we still need to click this save button and select a file location i'll just save over our file testing123 i'll click save yeah i'll replace it alright so we need to enter some text i guess so i will write a message such as the cake is a lie and hit enter so then our file testing123 now says the cake is a lie so you don't necessarily need to use the get function for a text area you can use the console window as well here's one last thing to consider before you go so what if we begin the process of finding a file location to save a file to and then we exit out of this window well we're going to encounter an exception so one way that we can prevent this is to add this line if file is none return so then if we were to try this again begin saving a file and then exit out of this there is no exception that we encounter so that's just one little extra i thought i would throw in but yeah that's the basics of saving files in python if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to save a file using python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a menu bar in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people let's create a menu bar not too different from the menu bar that you see at the top of many programs there's usually a tab for file edit view help stuff like that except we're going to create one that doesn't have as many options or features it's going to be the generic brand menu bar like the walmart variety so let's begin by creating a window so window equals tk followed by window.mainloop then we're going to create a menu bar and add menus to the menu bar and each menu is going to function like a dropdown menu where you hover over one of these tabs and there's a drop down so we need a menu bar let's just call this menu bar menu bar equals menu and we're adding this to our window so then we're going to take window dot config and we can set the menu of this window to equal the menu bar that we just created with each of these tabs for your menu bar you need to create a separate menu and add each menu to your menu bar and the menu bar is added to the window there's different levels to the stuff so let's create a file menu because well this one has a file menu why not our program so file menu equals menu kind of like what we did with our menu bar except instead of adding this to our window we're going to add this to our menu bar so menu bar like that there's one other step two we need to use this function menu bar dot add underscore cascade this will have a drop down menu sort of effect so let's create a label just called file to mimic the file tab that you see at the top of many programs so label file and we're going to set the menu to equal the file menu that we created so file menu and let's take a look just to see what we have so here's our menu bar and here's our menu there's a drop down effect for this but we need to add actual options to this file menu so let's do that so let's begin by creating let's see we got maybe open save and exit that should be good so file menu dot add underscore command so this is a clickable option and let's create a label called open and we can open a file and maybe two more so we got open save and exit open save exit and let's take a look at this so here's the drop down menu we can open save exit now you might notice that there is this annoying line this is called a tear off you can actually get rid of this if you want so when we create this file menu we're going to set tear off to equal zero and that should get rid of that and it's gone so sometimes you might see a line to separate sections well you can do that with a separator so let's separate the exit command that we have from open and save and to add that separator we just type in the name of our menu file menu dot add separator so this will separate your different commands from each other within a menu you can see that there is a line between save and exit because we placed a separator here now if you want each of these file commands to actually do something you need to associate a command with each of these commands it's a command within a command so command equals for our open file command we'll create a function called open file and we'll need to declare that function and then let's create a command called save file and then another called exit actually one shortcut if you want to exit something you can just say quit all right let's create an open file and a save file function so def open file let's just print something just to keep this simple i already have another video on opening files so print file has been opened and let's do the same thing for save file file has been saved and then our last command exit we'll just quit so let's try this so let's go to file here's the drop down menu we can open a file file has been opened we can save a file and then exit and exit will close out of our window let's create a second menu called edit to mimic the one that we have at the top of our ide so let's create a edit menu so it's the same process that we did with our file menu so let's call this edit menu equals menu we're adding this to our menu bar and i do not want a tear off so tear off equals zero then for the next line we need to add cascade so i'm going to copy this menu bar dot add cascade the label name will be edit and the file i mean the menu will be edit menu and we're setting this menu that we're adding to edit menu and let's try this so we have file and edit but we need to add commands to this edit menu so it's the same process that we did with our file menu i'm just going to copy this change file to edit and let's make a command called cut copy and paste so the label will be cut we'll create a command called cut we'll copy this and we'll create a another command called copy and then paste all right then we just need to create some functions for this so cut copy paste let's do that at the top so cut you cut some text so cut copy and then paste you copied some text and paste you pasted some text all right let's try this so here's our edit menu here's the drop down we can cut we can copy and we can paste not actually but it's going to call a function that can do something like that if you want to set that up maybe that's a video for a different day let's customize these menus well because we can so let's begin by changing the font so we can just type in within each of these menus font equals pick a font that you want and then a size so i'm going to add this font for both of these menus that we have and then when we hover over and click on these menus you can see that the font has changed did you guys know that you can actually add images next to each of these commands well you can and this is how we can do that first you'll need some images here's a few that i'm using so add these to your project folder i plan on using a floppy disk for save and open folder for open and for some reason a stop sign for exit because i couldn't really think of anything at the moment i guess an arrow would have worked too i guess so let's create some photo images out of these images so i already did this i'm just going to copy and paste the text that i had so create a unique name for each image i have open image save image and exit image they're all photo images and here is the file path or the file name for each of these pictures that i'm using so to add an image to each of these commands when you add the command we can just say image and then the photo image that you want to use so with my open command i'm going to use this open image photo image that i have and this is the open folder so i'm going to do the same thing for save and exit so we have save image and exit image but when we run and compile this let's take a look yeah so all the text is gone that's going to be a problem so we'll need to compound views so with compound we can add an image on a certain side of the text and keep the text so compound let's say we want the image on the left so compound left and i'm just going to add this to each of these commands and now we should have an image as well as some text well that's the basics of creating a menu bar in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how you can create a simple menu bar in python what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how frames work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show what's going on people we're going to be discussing frames today a frame is really just a rectangular container to group and hold widgets together so we're going to practice using frames today but first we'll need a window we're going to create a frame and add a frame to the window so window equals tk followed by window.main loop well we're going to need some widgets to add to our frame so let's create a bunch of buttons because why not so i'm going to show you guys a shortcut too so let's say button equals button and then for now we're going to add this to our window but we're going to replace this eventually with frame when we create this and i'm just going to set the text to equal let's say w we're going to have four different buttons wasd like the buttons on the keyboard if you're playing a game and you want to move forward left back or right so we're adding this to the window for now let's set the text to w and what else can we do uh let's change the font so font equals i'll pick the font consoles because that tends to be even uh with buttons the size of the button adjusts to uh the size of the uh letter that you're using or the size of the text uh so let's set this to 25 and then a width so maybe width equals three all right and then button.pack and i just want to take a look at this so here's our button w so i'd like to show you guys a shortcut if you don't plan on using this button by name you don't really need to give it a name you can just say button and then have all your uh options here and then instead of having button.pack just add dot pack to the end so this will do the same thing however you can't adjust this button by its name though because it doesn't have a name anymore so let's create a few other buttons one for a s and d so we have w a s d and by default they're all top and center so with pack we can actually put these on a certain side so let's say we want uh w on the top and then the other three will be all left so side equals left and then after i show this to you you'll see the benefits of using a frame all right so right now they're all at least it appears that they're all within a container so what if i were to expand this well w is just drifting off it's sailing away by w so what if we could put these within a frame or container to actually contain all of these widgets well we can so let's create a frame frame equals frame and instead of adding these buttons to the window we're going to add these buttons to our frame and now we need to add the frame to the window and this is what this looks like however we need to actually add this by using pack or place so frame dot pack so now what this looks like is that all of these buttons all of these widgets are now contained within a frame a container let's change the background color of this frame just so that we can see the width and the height of this frame so when you create your frame there is an option for background color it's just bg and let's set this to a color we haven't done pink yet pink is a very masculine color so now the background of our frame is pink and that might be a better visual cue to the balance of the frame let's also give this frame a border so let's set a width of 5 using bd and then the type of border that we want and we can specify that with relief so relief equals let's say raised so this will have a 3d pop effect kind of like that let's try sunken there's a few other ones as well but i don't feel like it's necessary to go over all the border types let's stick with sunken for now that'll work alright so with this frame we are currently packing this we can set this on a certain side within our window so currently it's at the top let's set this to maybe the bottom so side equals bottom now this frame is sticking to the bottom of the window and it still contains all of the buttons all of the widgets that we added another function available to you is the place function we can place this frame at certain coordinates within our window so let's set x to equal zero and y to equal zero so then when we place this frame within our window and set some coordinates this entire frame is going to stick at these coordinates even if we were to resize this window and we can change these too let's say x is now 100 and y is also 100 so the frame along with all of the components all of the widgets that it contains are sticking within the container and they move along with this so that's the basics of frames it's really just a rectangular container to group and hold widgets together so if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below and well yeah that's how frames work in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys a few different ways in which we can create new windows using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show let's get started everybody so we're going to create a window and we'll add a button to this window when we click on this button it'll create a new separate window for us so window equals tk followed by window.main loop we'll need to add a button so let's do that button we're adding this to the window let's add some text to the button let's say create new window and we'll set a command command equals and we'll need to define a function let's create a function called create underscore window and let's pack this as well so we will define this function create window and let's do so at the top def create window and what do we want this to do well we're going to create a new window and let's call this next window new underscore window equals and there's two popular ways of creating a window one is we can use tk and the other is that we can use something called top level and let me explain the difference between the two here's a definition for a top level window this is a new window on top of other windows and it's usually linked to a bottom window our main window is serving as the bottom window and our new window is serving as the top window the top level window so let's try this and just experiment here is our main window the bottom window and if we were to click on this button it's going to create a new window for us a new top level window if we were to close out of the bottom level window any top level windows associated with this would also close kind of like what you just saw now however it's not the same case the other way around if we have a bottom window and a top level window and we close out of the top level window our bottom level window is just fine it didn't close out of that so think of these like jenga pieces if you were to pull one of the pieces one of the windows out from underneath the bottom any pieces or windows on the top of it will close out as well or collapse kind of like in the game jenga so that's one way to think of top level windows they're stacked on top of any bottom level windows if you remove a bottom piece it removes any from the top on the flip side we have tk this is a new independent window and we've actually been doing this since day one of our gui programming tk is a new independent window and our main window and the new window that we create are not linked whatsoever they're completely independent so if we were to create a new window this is our new window and close out of our old window well this new window still persists so this could be useful for let's say a login form or a login screen after you log in you'll be brought to your main program which could be within the new window one other thing that you can do too you can also destroy the old window after creating a new window so we need to type in the name of the window that we want to destroy actually let's call the main window just old underscore window just to clarify things so let's rename that here here and here as well so we want to destroy our old window as if we're closing out of it so we type in the name of the window old underscore window and we use the destroy function and that sounds pretty sweet so we're going to destroy our old window after creating our new window so let me add a comment that this will close out of old window and let's test it so we have our old window our main window we'll create a new window it creates our new window and then closes out of the old window so that's one of a few ways in which you can create a new window for your program so if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to create a new window using python hey what's going on everybody too bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create separate tabs for our gui applications in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay let's begin so in order to create tabs for our python gui application we're going to need access to a widget called notebook and that's found in a different module so this time we're going to need two imports so at the top from tk enter import just everything but the notebook widget is found within a separate module so we'll need a second import from tk enter import ttk so this ttk import gives us access to several different widgets that are normally not available to us so once you have these two imports you're ready to begin so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and we need to create a notebook widget so right after you create your window we're going to create a notebook we'll call this notebook equals ttk dot notebook and we want to add this notebook to our window so let me add a comment here what this widget does so this is a widget that manages a collection of windows and displays and that's really all there is to it so in order to create different tabs we're going to create some frames so for the first tab i'll call this tab 1 equals frame and we want to add this to the notebook and with our notebook we're adding this notebook to the window all right so this will be a new frame for tab one and let's create a second tab and we'll call this tab two and you can create more tabs if you want but that might be overkill so this is a new frame for tab two after you finish these two lines of code we're going to follow this up with notebook.ad so notebook.ad what widget are we adding we're adding our tab 1 frame and we can set some text for this tab so text equals and i'll type in tab one and we'll repeat the process for tab two so notebook dot add tab two and we'll change the text to tab two and then we need to pack this notebook notebook dot pack and let's take a look to see what we have all right we have tab one and tab two but we'll probably want to actually add something to each of these tabs so that the content is visible so let's create some labels so after we pack our notebook let's create some labels i don't really feel like giving these names because we don't really plan on using them for anything else so we'll just say label tab one that's going to be the parent widget and let's set some text text equals hello this is tab number one then i think i'll give this a width and a height too just so it's more visible so for the width i'll make this 50 and the height 25 so this will be roughly a square shape and then we need to pack this so i'm just going to add pack and let's create a second label for tab two so label tab two maybe i'll say goodbye this is tab number two okay we should have some actual content for these labels now for these tabs so here's the label this is tab one and this is tab two and you can switch between these and they display each of these separate labels however with the way that this window is arranged if we were to expand the size of this window well our frames and our tabs kind of stay in the top and in the center so i'm going to add a few lines within the pack function of our notebook the first thing i'm going to do is use the expand option and set this to true so what this does and i'm just going to add a comment that expand this will expand to fill any space not otherwise used so what happens now is that this will actually expand and it's staying in the center of the window but there's one more thing we're going to add fill equals both normally this is x or y or you can do both so i'll add a comment as to what this option does so fill will fill space on x and y axis so if you combine both of these together what you get is that these tabs will stay in the top left corner and if you were to expand the size of this window the tabs aren't going to move they're going to stick to the top left but the size of the window will expand all right so that's the basics of creating tabs in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating tabs in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the grid geometry manager in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right everybody let's talk about the grid geometry manager well because we have to this is a useful way to organize widgets within a container imagine our windows being arranged into a series of rows and columns similar to an excel spreadsheet i tend to use that example a lot the top left most cell is row zero column zero computers always begin with zero so that's why our grid doesn't begin with row one column one and we can list which row and column we would like our widgets to be placed within and by default we only have one row and one column to work with at the start but we can explicitly state which row and column this widget should be placed within relative to the container that it's in and python will create new relative rows and columns for us if we state where these widgets should be placed so let's create a small submission form and then organize all of our widgets using our new grid system that we have so let's begin by creating a window window equals tk followed by window.mainloop now that we have our window we'll need to create some widgets to add to this window so let's say that we want an entry box and a label for a first name last name and email address as well as a submit button so let's create a label and an entry box for a first name just to demonstrate this so let's call this label first name label equals label we're adding this to the window and let's set the text to first name for now i'm just going to use that pack to demonstrate the differences between pack and grid and let's create an entry box let's call this first name entry equals entry we are adding this to the window and for now we're just going to pack this and let's take a look so here's our label on the top it says first name and then it has our entry box right underneath so what if we want to have this label on the left hand side and our entry box on the right hand side of the label we're better off using the grid geometry manager so we're going to replace pack with grid and we have to set which row and column that we want each of these widgets to be placed within normally if you use the pack geometry manager as you create new widgets they're just going to be placed directly underneath in one long column so let's say that for our name label we want to place this where the row is zero and the column is zero that's the top left corner so within the grid geometry manager when we call it we're going to set row to equal zero as well as column to equal zero and then for the first name entry we want this to be on the right hand side of our label so we'll place this within the same row row equals zero but in a different column column equals one so column one is directly to the right of column zero and then when we compile and run this we now have our entry box to the right of our label that we have so let's repeat the process for a last name an email address and then a submit button so i'm just going to copy what we have here and change first name to last name so last name label and we'll change the text to last name last name entry and we'll keep that the same now we want this last name label to be underneath the first name label because right now they're going to overlap because we have them in the same row and columns so you can see that we can no longer see the first name label or the first name entry so let's place this directly underneath we're going to put these underneath by one row so we'll keep the columns the same but we're going to put this underneath by one row so row one and row one for the last name entry and what you get is that these two labels and entry boxes are arranged neatly into rows and columns and let's do the same thing for an email so i'm going to copy what we have and we're going to change last name to email so email label and email entry and then change for the text last name to just email and we're going to place these where row equals 2 and we'll keep the column the same and for email entry row 2 column one so doesn't that look a lot better now let's create a submit button so let's call this submit button equals button and then we're adding this to the window and we should set some text text equals submit i guess dot grid and we want to place this underneath currently kind of just shoves it underneath for now let's say that we want this between these two columns so we'll want to set the row and the column to begin with row is going to equal three and column we'll set this equal to zero for now there isn't going to be any apparent change it's still going to be in the same place but one thing that we can do is use an option called column span we can have a widget take up more than one column and it's going to place this widget in between both of these columns in between the combined width of both of them so we'll add column span equals two so this widget is going to take up the next two available columns including the one that it's currently in and you can see that our submit button is now between these two columns that we have one thing that you should know is that the column width is dependent on the width of the largest widget that is contained within that particular column let's say that we increase the width of our first name label well our column is going to expand to actually fit that widget that we have so for our first name label let's set the width to maybe 20 and this is going to increase the width of column 0 and to even better demonstrate this let's color each label a certain color just for a visual for our first name label let's say this is red and then for our last name label let's set this to green and then for email maybe blue now all of these are color coordinated and you can see that the background color of our first name label is taking up the entire column space now what if we changed the size of our email label to something even larger like 30 so width equals 30. and now the column 0 has expanded to accommodate the size of our largest widget which is our email which has a width of 30 and before we finish this video let's add a title to the submission form right on top of the first name label and the entry label so let's call this title label equals label writing this to the window let's set some text let's say enter your info and let's pick font font equals what am i feeling like today maybe just arial and then a size maybe 25 we're going to use the grid geometry manager and we want this at the top so we want row zero at least i want this to take up two columns so we'll say column equals zero and then set a column span column span equals two now a few things are going to overlap here so we're going to move everything down by one row besides our title label so we want this first name label to be directly underneath our title label so let's move everything down by one row and our title is going to be directly on top of our first name label as well as the first name entry box that we have all right so that's the very basics of the grid geometry manager if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the grid geometry manager in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a progress bar in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay let's create a progress bar but we'll need a few imports to begin the progress bar widget is found within that ttk module so we'll need a separate import from that from tk enter dot ttk import everything and we'll import everything from time as well let's create a window window equals tk followed by window.mainloop we're going to add a progress bar and a button to this window when we click on the button it's going to fill our progress bar let's begin by creating a button to begin with let's call this button equals button we're adding this to the window let's set some text text equals maybe download and then a command maybe i'll call this start finish by adding this button to the window and we'll just use pack to do that let's define what our start function does def start we'll fill this in later i'm just going to print nothing just as a placeholder and we should just have a button now let's add a progress bar before this button and we'll call this progress bar just bar for short bar equals progress bar we're adding this to the window we can set an orientation this can be horizontal or vertical later on in this video i'll show you the differences between the two but for now let's set this to horizontal and then i'm going to pack this bar bar dot pack and add some padding pad y equals 10 and let's see what we have okay this is our progress bar at the top and this is the button when we click on this button it's going to fill our progress bar but i think i'm going to increase the length of this progress bar let's set this to maybe 300 i believe 100 is the default okay that's not too bad of a size now let's define what our start function does we can actually increase the value of our progress bar by typing in the name of this progress bar here value plus equals some amount let's say 10. so what's going to happen right now is that every time we click on this button it's going to fill our progress bar by 10 out of the total which is 100 let's pretend that we're waiting for a certain amount of tasks to complete so let's define a few variables let's say we have a variable called tasks and let's set this to 10 just to keep it simple and x will represent the current task that we're on and we'll say 0 to begin with let's create a while loop while x is less than the amount of tasks that we have we will increment the value of our bar by 10. 10 10 for each test that we have which is 10 for a total of 100 and we'll want to increment the task that we're on as well which is represented by x so let's increment x by 1 after each iteration of this while loop now when we run this and click download this spills instantly let's add a delay just to simulate each task waiting to be completed so let's add that here let's add a delay by using time dot sleep and let's set this to one second we're going to wait one second and then complete a task what ends up happening now is that nothing appears to be updating well what gives bro you lie to me well that's because the window is waiting to have this progress bar complete before it's actually going to display it being filled so we would want to refresh this window after each iteration of the while loop so at the end of this while loop let's add one thing window dot update underscore idle tasks after each iteration of this while loop it's going to update the window that we have so then when we download something it's going to update our progress bar after each iteration of this while loop until it's completed right about now let's take this a step further by adding a label that displays the current percent of the progress bar that is complete let's add this label after the progress bar but before the button sandwiched right between these two widgets so let's add that here we'll call this label percent label equals label we'll add this to the window and we'll need a text variable text variable equals let's call this percent so the reason that we use a text variable is so that we can update this label with some text after each iteration of our while loop and we'll need to pack this okay within the window near the top let's define percent percent equals string var this allows us to update percent with some new text and set the percent label with the new text that we have within the while loop but before we update idle tasks let's set what percent is percent dot set and let's say x divided by tasks and then we'll multiply this by 100 i'm just going to put this within its own set of parentheses times 100 and then we'll convert all of this to a string so we can display this along with some text there are a lot of parentheses here so it might be difficult to keep track of all this all right and then we're just going to tack on percent and that's it let's try it so we got 10 20 30 40 50. i'll shut up now one change that i'm gonna make is that i'm going to cast all of this as an integer before we convert it to a string because i do not like that decimal at the end of our percentage so yeah it says 10 percent 20 so on and so forth let's add a label that displays the current task that we're on so let's copy what we have for our percent label and let's rename this as maybe task label task label text variable will equal maybe text and let's define what text is so text is also a string var and within our while loop let's update the value of our text text dot set will display x plus maybe a forward slash plus our tasks and since we're displaying integers along with some strings we need to convert these to strings and we can use the str function to do that for us so surround x and tasks with str to convert these to strings and then we'll add just plus tasks completed so the value of x will update after each iteration of this while loop let's try it and after clicking download this will display the percentage as well as the amount of tasks that have been completed all the way until it reaches the end let's change this into a more practical example we'll pretend that we're downloading a video game so let's replace or rename tasks as maybe gb4 gigabytes and this game will be 100 gigabytes we'll rename x as well so let's refactor rename and change x to maybe download to represent the amount of gigabytes that are downloaded and let's create a variable called speed and let's set this to one alright so while our download is less than the amount of gigabytes for this game we'll sleep for maybe a portion of a second .05 should be good we'll increase the value of our bar by this amount speed divided by gigabytes and then multiply this by 100 for the download we're going to increment this by whatever our speed is and right now it's one so that's the same we can keep percent the same for our text let's change tasks to gigabytes and that's all the changes that we have to make and now when we download something we're kind of pretending that we're downloading a large file or a game you can see that once it reaches 100 it says 100 100 out of 100 gigabytes completed now we can change this to a different value let's say maybe 50 and the speed will be maybe two so this will adjust to accommodate whatever the new file size is as well as the speed and before i forget you can change the orientation to a vertical bar if you so choose so we have this vertical download bar now which could be good for something all right so that's the basics of progress bars in python if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of progress bars in python what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use the canvas widget to draw some simple shapes so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome back everyone well in this video we're going to be creating a canvas a canvas is a widget that is used to draw simple graphs plots and images within a window we're going to be creating some simple shapes in this video not anything too sophisticated i might get more into the canvas widget in a separate video and at the end of this lesson we're going to practice by creating a pokeball so to begin we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop to create a canvas we can just simply call this canvas canvas equals canvas and we're adding this canvas to our window and then we need to follow this with canvas.pack or place but i'm just going to use pack because it's simple this is what our canvas looks like it's a rectangular area which we can draw graphics on we can also set the width and the height of this canvas so when we create this canvas we're going to set the options for a height and a width so let's begin with the height height equals let's say 500 and the width will be the same 500 and now we have a square canvas that we can draw graphics on let's begin by creating some simple shapes maybe a line i think a line is a shape maybe a one-dimensional one i don't know i don't geometry so let's create a simple line so we type the name of the canvas dot create and there's a bunch of different shapes that we can create let's create a line now i'm just going to turn this into a comment for a moment we need to set some coordinates for this line this top left corner of our canvas is 0 0 and the bottom right corner of this canvas is 500 by 500 depends on what you set the dimensions of the canvas to so when we create a line we need a starting point and an ending point so if we want this to start in the top left corner we're going to pass in 0 0 that is the starting position and we can place the coordinates for the ending position if we want this line to end in the bottom right corner that would be where x is 500 and y is 500 and this is what this looks like we just have a simple line going across the screen but that's not all we can also change the color of this line and the thickness let's begin by changing the color so we can do that with fill fill equals let's pick color blue and now we have a blue line going across the screen but we can also change the width of this as well so we can do that using the width option and let's set this to five now we get an extra thick line across the screen now let's make a red line so i'm just going to copy this canvas.createline and let's change some coordinates for this uh let's say we want this to start in the bottom left corner and go up to the top right so the starting x position would be zero y would actually be 500 x for the ending position would be 500 and y would be zero let's set this to red and we'll keep the width the same okay so here's our red line and notice that this red line is overlapping the blue line so when you create shapes on a canvas if there's any that overlap the one that you most recently created will appear on the top one option available to you is that you can actually give these graphics a unique name with our blue line we could call this blue line blue line equals all of this and then we can call our red line something different like red line this would be useful if you want to call or use a graphic by its name if you want to like move a graphic on the screen or have something appear you can use this by its name but we don't really need it for this lesson so i'll just revert this back to what we had previously i'm just letting you know that you can do that alright what do we have up next let's create a rectangle so canvas dot create rectangle we can set some starting coordinates and ending coordinates the starting coordinates are for the top left of the rectangle and the ending coordinates are for the bottom right so for the starting coordinates let's say we're going to place this where x is 50 y is 50. for the ending coordinates we want this where x is 250 and y is 250 i'm just making up numbers put it whatever you want really and this is what this looks like but i think i'm going to comment out these lines for now and here is our rectangle well i guess it's also a square we can actually give this a fill color as well so we do that with the fill option fill equals purple i guess and now we have a purple rectangle next on our list is create polygon we can create many sorts of shapes using create polygon but it really depends on how many coordinates that we enter let's create a simple triangle so we need at least three coordinates for this to work so canvas dot create polygon and i have some coordinates picked out already so let's place the first set of coordinates where x is 250 y is zero for the second set where x is 500 and y is 500 in the last set the third set we'll place this where x is zero and y is 500 and what this looks like is that we have this black triangle that's taking up most of the canvas we can also change the fill color as well so we do that with the option fill and we can set this to whatever color you want let's say yellow and we now have a yellow triangle on our screen and it kind of resembles the triforce from the legend of zelda series one of my personal favorites let's also add a border this is actually done with outline outline equals and then pick a color for the outline let's say black and we have a black outline around this graphic and you can also change the thickness of this too with width and let's set the width to five and now we have an extra thick line around our triangle with these shapes you can pass in a list of points too so i'm going to get rid of all these and we're going to pass in a list so let's create a list called points points equals all the points that we just entered in previously and then instead of passing in all these coordinates individually i'm just going to pass in our list of points and this will work exactly the same okay let's create an arc now so canvas dot create arc and arc is really just a curved line between at two points however when we list some coordinates we're not listing the coordinates of the starting position and ending position for this arc it's more or less for the amount of space that we want to allocate to actually draw this arc so let's say that we want this arc to take up the entire canvas we can pass in the dimensions for this canvas so the top left corner is zero zero and the height and the width are five hundred so this is our arc it resembles a pie slice it's not starting in the top left corner and ending down here that's the amount of space that we're giving this crate arc function to actually draw an arc it's really an entire circle but only a portion of it is visible let's also set a fill color for this so fill equals what color did we not pick yet let's say green and now we have a green pie slice there's different styles you can do too so we can change that with style equals the default is pi slice that's what we had previously let's change this to chord this will draw a line between these two points and this kind of resembles like a bow like a ball with arrows and there's also just arc where it's simply just a curved line let's change this back to pie slice well because i like pie we can change the starting position of where this arc begins with the option start so start equals 0 by default so there's going to be no apparent change let's adjust this by 90 degrees so this is in degrees so this shifted what is this direction counterclockwise by 90 degrees so 180 would theoretically flip this and now this is on the other side of what we had previously and then 270. all right we can also set an extent so the default is normally 90 degrees but let's change this to 180 and now we have a what is that hemisphere half a circle all right people let's practice by creating a pokeball there's still one more function that we have to cover it's called create oval but we'll do that as we're making this so let's begin by creating the top red hemisphere of this pokeball so that's canvas dot create arc and we're going to set the extent of this to 0 0 500 500 so that this is going to take up the entire canvas and then let's also set a fill color to red so fill equals red we need to change the extent of how far this extends so we'll do that with the extent function so extent equals 180 so that this is a half circle and let's also change the thickness of this outline as well using the width option so width equals 10 would be good and we have a red hemisphere for the top of our pokeball let's work on the bottom half so that is a white hemisphere so canvas dot create arc these are all the same we'll change the fill to white the extent will be the same but we need a different starting position so start equals 180. so this is going to begin at the 180 degree mark so when you combine these both together we get two different colored hemispheres that form a perfect circle now let's create an oval within the center of this pokeball so we're going to do that with canvas dot create oval we're going to set the amount of space that we want to give the circle to be drawn so we'll place this where x is 190 where y is 190 where x 2 or the second x position is 310 and y2 is 310 let's set the fill color next so we do that with fill fill equals white and lastly let's just give this a thicker border so that is width equals 10 to match the width for the two arcs that we have and there you have it we have a simple pokeball all right well that's the basics of the canvas widget if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the canvas widget in python what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create key events in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome back everyone in this video we're going to be discussing at key events we can bind a key event and a function to a widget or a window so that when we press a certain key or do something we can trigger a function to be called that will perform some sort of task for us so we can actually do this by using the bind function so widgets and windows have access to a bind function so when our window or our widget is selected and then you press a certain key or do something then it's going to call a certain function to perform a task for us so there's two arguments within the bind function this takes an event as well as a function name let's say that when we press the enter key we want to call this function to do something so for this event what we type for that is a set of quotes angle brackets and the name of the button so for example if you want to press w to move forward like you're playing a game this would be w a s d there's also up down and then let's say we want to press enter to do something that is actually a return and then we will call this function so let's create a function called do something and let's define this at the top def do something now pay attention to this part we need to set up one parameter for this do something function this needs an event so be sure to include that and it's easy to forget so what do we want to do after we press enter let's just print a message you did a thing and this should work now so let's try it so while this window has focus ability we can actually uh have this respond to events so right now i'm pressing all sorts of keys you can probably hear me right now going crazy on my keyboard but now i'm going to hit enter and it says you did a thing and you can bind all sorts of keys to this window let's say that i want to press q to quit so we'll just replace this with lowercase q so i'm typing all sorts of keys but now i'm going to press q and it says you did a thing kind of like we're quitting the game you can actually have this respond to all keys well almost all of them so to do that you just type in key with the capital k so i can pretty much press on any key then it's going to trigger or call our function kind of like that so one thing that we could do we can display the key event that was pressed so i'm just going to add that here maybe i'll change this message u pressed plus and to display what key was pressed that is event dot key sim i believe that's for key symbol so this will actually display what button you pressed so w-a-s-d here's a unique idea for practice let's say that we want to add a label to our window and we're going to change the text on the label to reflect whatever key that we press so let's create a label label equals label we're adding this to our window and let's change the font as well to something massive like helvetica and a size of 100 that should be good then we need to pack this label so label dot pack then within this function let's turn this into a comment and we're going to use label dot config and we're going to update our text and the text is going to be whatever key that we press so we can do that with event dot key sim so now this label is going to display whatever key that we press so for example w a s d backspace escape up up down down left right left right b a start all right so that's the basics of key events if you could do me a favor and in the comments down below just press f to pay respects so if you want a copy of this code i'll post this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of key events in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about mouse events in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey everyone we're going to be discussing mouse events in python so before we begin we'll need a window so window equals tk followed by window.main loop and in the last video we learned that we can bind a widget or a window so that when a certain event occurs we can call a function so we're going to do the same thing for this video but we have various mouse events that we can cover so we're going to use the window.bind function and this takes two arguments an event as well as a function name so let's define a function let's call it the do something function so do something and we'll need to define this so at the top def do something and remember that we need to set up one parameter for this function the parameter is an event and then we'll just print something print you did a thing okay so there are various mouse events for a left button click within quotes and then within angle brackets a left button click is button dash one so then if we were to click within this window it's going to call our function you did a thing but if i were to right click it doesn't do anything so there are other mouse events too so button two is that scroll wheel not if you scroll up or down but if you press in on it so right now i'm clicking left i'm clicking right now i'm going to press in on the mouse wheel and it says you did a thing button three is a right mouse click so i'm clicking left nothing but i'm gonna click right and that seems to work all right so button one i'm just going to add a note left mouse click button two is the scroll wheel that's if you press in on it and then button three is a right mouse click so did you guys know we can actually get the x and y coordinates of where this event occurred so to do that we type in the name of the event dot x however since we're displaying this along with some text we'll need to convert this to a string so string event dot x then i'll add the y coordinates as well event.y i think i'll just add a comma between these to separate them and we'll change our text so we'll say mouse coordinates all right let's try this again so this is going to give us the coordinates of where we click and right now i'm just left clicking so the top left corner is zero zero well at least close to it not there exactly alright so here's a few other events that we can cover i'm going to copy this we have button release if we were to release a button it's going to trigger our event so right now i'm holding in on the left mouse button but i'm going to let go then it triggers our event if i were to right click and hold it it doesn't do anything but as soon as i let go then our event is triggered we also have enter not to be confused with the enter button just going to get rid of that so that is enter if we were to enter our binded window or widget so if i were to enter it's going to give the coordinates of where i entered this there is also leave so i'm going to say that enter the window and leave is leave the window so if i enter nothing happens but as soon as i leave it gives the coordinates and the last one is motion as long as the cursor is in motion so this one might be good for a game so that is motion where the mouse moved it's consistently giving me the coordinates if i'm moving the mouse but if i were stationary or stop moving it stops all right so that's the basics of mouse events in python if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of mouse events in python hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can drag and drop widgets in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right people let's just dive into this so we'll need a window and then we're going to be adding widgets to the window so window equals tk followed by window.main loop now you can drag and drop all sorts of widgets but let's just stick with the label because creating a label is simple so let's define a label label equals label we're going to be adding this label to the window and let's set a background color so we can actually see this label pick i don't know your favorite color i'm going to pick red and then i'm going to set a width and a height because normally if you have a label without any text it's really small so let's set a width of maybe 10 and then a height of 5. that should be good and we want to place this label someplace within the window so label dot place and we can pass in some x coordinates as well as y coordinates so x equals zero and y equals zero so that this is going to appear in the top left corner of our window so this is what we have this is our label and we want to be able to drag and drop this label someplace within the window what we're going to need to do is actually bind this label twice but let's begin with just the first binding so in order to bind a widget you type in the name of the widget followed by calling the bind function so this bind function can take two arguments it can take an event as well as a function name so for the function name let's call this drag underscore start but you don't really need to name it the same that i do and for the event that occurs this is going to be a left button click with the mouse so that event is within quotes and within angle brackets button dash one so if we were to click someplace within the label using the left mouse button it's going to call our drag start function but we need to define this so at the top of our program let's define this function def drag start and this takes one parameter the parameter we have is our event so what we're going to do is actually get the coordinates of where we click within this label and we're going to assign these to a new variable or attribute of our label so label dot let's create an attribute called start x equals our event dot x so this is where we click within the label and not necessarily the window and let's repeat the process for y so label dot start y equals event dot y so we're going to have some coordinates of where we click within this label and we can actually use that for our next function so we're going to bind this label a second time so i'm going to copy this line and paste it the second binding let's say is drag underscore motion for the function name and this event is going to occur if we were to hold down the left mouse button and then drag so that is b one dash motion and then we need to define this function so at the top d e f drag underscore motion and this takes our event as a parameter so this part is going to be a little funky we're going to get or create new x and y coordinates so let's begin with x x equals the name of our label or widget label dot w info underscore x this is a function so add some parentheses this will get the top left x coordinate of our label relative to the window that we're in minus label x well labeled.startx plus event dot x all right so we're going to do the same thing for y well we're going to replace x with y for the second line all right so this is the top left corner the x coordinate of our widget relative to the window this is the place where we click within the label itself and this is where we begin dragging our widget to it's a little difficult to explain but if you can find combine combine all of these together you'll get the new coordinates of where you want to drag this component this widget to so we need to replace this widget so label dot place x equals x and y equals y so then when you combine all of these together we have our widget and we can drag it and drop it someplace else within the window now wait a second what if we have more than one widget well with the way that our functions are written now they wouldn't be compatible with more than one widget just this label itself so what if we were to create a second label so i'm going to call the second label just label two so i'm just going to rename them and let's change the background color to maybe blue and i'm just going to place this somewhere else within our window so maybe where x is 100 and y is 100 and we'll need to bind label two as well so make sure to bind label two so we have label one binded it's just called label and the same thing with label two all right let's see what happens i'm going to attempt to drag label 2. the label 1 is moving that's because with our functions we stated we're getting the coordinates and we're storing them within the attributes of label 1 and not necessarily label two so in order to make these functions compatible with all widgets we can actually add one line of code widget equals event dot widget so this is going to get the widget of the event that we're dealing with and we're going to temporarily rename this as widget so now we're going to replace all instances of where we use label and replace it with widget be sure to do the same thing too with drag motion and then we will need to add this line at the top of drag motion so now these functions are now compatible with any widget that we create and we should be able to drag and drop both widgets all right well that's the basics of dragging and dropping widgets in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of dragging and dropping widgets in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can move an image on both a window and a canvas in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right my fellow bros i'm going to divide this video into two different sections in the first section we're going to move a widget within a window and in the next section we're going to move an image on a canvas so let's begin by moving a widget within a window so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.mainloop and we'll also need to set some geometry for this window window dot geometry let's make this 500x500 500 x 500 and let's take a look okay that should be a decent size let's add a label to this window so i actually have a race car image that i want to use if you would like an image feel free to pause the video and download one what i would like to do is create a photo image from this png file that i have i'm just going to call this my image equals photo image file equals since this is within my project folder i can just list the file name otherwise you might have to list the file path and for me this is called racecar.png i want to add this image to my label not necessary but it'll be helpful for this example i'm going to call my label just a label label equals label i'm adding this to the window and i'm going to set the image to equal my image that i created it's a photo image if you do not have an image that you want to use you can simply just change the background color you could say bg i don't know red oh then we need to place this so be sure to do that label dot place and i'm going to place this in the top left corner that is where x equals zero and y equals zero and then we should have a race car or whatever image you used and a red background you can get rid of the background color if you prefer that's just if you don't have an image to use you can set the background color just for a visual to show you where the label currently is let's set some key bindings for this window and let's add them maybe here before we create the label and our image so let's find the w key for up s for down a for left and d for right so we do that with window dot bind and we pass in an event as well as a function name so we want to tie the w key to a function and we'll call this move underscore up and then we will need to define this so outside of the window let's define move underscore up and this takes an event so we'll place that as a parameter and to move our label up we're going to take label dot place and we're going to place this at some new coordinates x equals the label's current position relative to the window that it's in so that is label dot w info underscore x all right so then for y it's similar y equals label dot w info underscore y but we're going to subtract maybe one all right so this is all we need although this is only going to move up so i'm going to press w and our label our race car or whatever image you used is going to move slowly up i'm going to increase this to 10 so the change is more drastic so now our race car is drifting off into space let's find a few other keys s a and d sad all right so s will be down move underscore down a for left move left and d for right move right we'll just copy what we have here and make a few changes let's begin with move down the only thing we're going to change within here is in place of subtracting 10 from the y coordinate we're going to add 10 and with our race car oh i guess we have to define these so let's do that real quick uh so we have left move left we're going to subtract 10 from the x coordinate and keep y the same and then the same thing for move right move underscore right and this time we are going to add 10 to x and y will stay the same okay now with our image we can move up down right and then left and y stop there we combine these to our arrow keys so up is just up with a capital u down is down these are all capital by the way left is left and then right is right and now i can use my arrow keys to move this image now for this part of the video i'm going to teach you guys how we can move an image on a canvas this time and not just within a window but we'll need a window to begin with window equals tk followed by window.mainloop and we're going to create a canvas canvas equals canvas we're adding this canvas to the window and let's set a width and height for the width let's make this 500 and the height 500 as well so this is an even square and we'll need to pack or place this canvas canvas.pack should take care of that and let's run this and this is our canvas at this step we need to add an image to our canvas and i have an image of a racecar that i want to add so i need to create a photo image from this file so we can do that let's give this photo image a unique name i'm just going to call this photo image to keep it simple photo image equals photo image and i can list the file path or the file name since this image is within my project folder i only have to list the file name and my file is called racecar.png this next step we need to give our image a unique name the image that's being added to the canvas i'll call this my image equals and we need to turn this photo image into an image added to the canvas so we type in the name of the canvas canvas dot create underscore image we first need to list the coordinates of where we want to place this photo image so let's place this in the top left corner that is where x is 0 and y 0 and we need to set the image of the image that we're creating so we can do that with saying image equals the name of our photo image and let's see what we have so far so this image is somewhat cut off in the top left corner we can easily fix that by anchoring our image when we create it so let's at the end add anchor equals northwest so that should fix that problem and we now have our image that we want to use and to move our image we can set some key bindings so we type in the name of the window dot bind and we pass in two arguments an event as well as a function name let's tie pressing the w key to moving up so the first argument is going to be w and the second is going to be a function name so let's say move underscore up and let's find some other keys w for up s for down a for left and d for right we'll need to define these now so at the top outside of the window let's begin by defining move up def move up this has an event as a parameter and let's create the other definitions here so i'm just going to rename these so we have move up move down move left and move right okay now this next step we can use the canvases move function to move an image a certain amount of pixels on the x-axis and y-axis so let's begin with move up we type in the name of the canvas dot and use the move function and this has three arguments the image that we want to use and this image is called my image the one with the race car the next argument is the amount of pixels we're moving this on the x-axis with up we can keep this the same but on the y-axis let's say we want to move this up 10 pixels so that would be -10 and let's repeat the process for move down move left and move right for move down we're going to change y to 10 for move left we'll keep y the same at zero but we're going to subtract 10 and then move right we are going to add 10 to our x's and that should be it so we can move up down right left and if you want to bind these to some arrow keys all we have to do is just change the event so we can bind these to our wsad keys as well as up down left and right and this time i'm going to use my arrow keys up down right and left all right so that's a few of the basics of moving either widgets or images on a canvas or window if you would like a copy of all this code for both examples i'll post both of them in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of moving widgets and images in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create some simple 2d animations in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show alright my fellow bros in this video we're going to be animating an image on a canvas we're only going to be moving this image up down left and right feel free to download an image that you want to use i'm just going to use this ufo emoji that i found so we'll need two imports at the top from tk enter import everything that's what we usually have we'll also need to import time as well we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop we'll need a canvas i'm going to call the canvas canvas canvas equals canvas we're adding the canvas to the window i'm going to create something that's called a constant we're going to create a constant for the width and the height of our canvas so a constant is a variable or value that you don't plan on changing later at all and a common naming convention for a constant is that the name of the constant is all uppercase so i want the width and the height of this canvas to be constants so for the width this is going to be all uppercase it's not necessary to make it all uppercase but that's a common naming convention for the width i'm going to set this to 500 and the height set to 500 as well and for the width of this canvas i'm going to set the width to equal my constant which is 500 and the height to my constant height so the reason that i'm making constants is that we'll be reusing these a lot later in this program so we might as well just declare them now and get it over with so for the canvas we're adding this to the window we're setting the width to our constant of width and the height to our constant of height and we need to follow this by packing this or place canvas dot pack pack to make it simple so we should have a canvas on our window now if you have an image that you want to use we're going to animate it i need to create a photo image from this file it's a png file it's called ufo but yours is probably going to be named something different so don't copy me exactly i need to create a photo image from this i'm going to call this photo underscore image but name it whatever you want this equals photo image and i need to list the file path or the file name since this file is within my project folder i only have to list the file name and for me this is called ufo.png our next step is that we're going to take our photo image and add this photo image to the canvas and we'll also give this image a unique name i'm going to call this my image equals we're going to use the canvases create image function so canvas dot create image there's a few arguments that we need to pass in where we want this image to appear we need a set of coordinates if we want this to appear in the top left corner that is where x is zero and y is zero for the image we're going to set this equal to our photo image whatever you named this and lastly we should anchor this i'm going to anchor this in the northwest corner to keep it simple and we should have our image on our canvas in the top left corner and here is my ufo that's being piloted by a green alien that's waving to me aliens are usually not that friendly unless they're abducting you our next step is to create a while loop so we'll say wow true this will continue forever until we close out of the program if you're looking at the code for a game this might say instead while running running will be a boolean variable that contains either true or false so if this is true while the game is running they're going to continue moving all of the characters on the screen and then if somebody pauses the game or closes out of the game then they'll flip this running variable to false but to keep things simple we'll just say wow true but that's something that you might see what we'll want to do is get the coordinates of our image within the canvas and this will return a list of coordinates so let's create a list called coordinates so coordinates equals canvas and we can use the chords function to get the coordinates i guess that's short for coordinates and we're getting the coordinates of my image so we'll pass this into this function and then let's print this just to see what this returns we'll print coordinates okay now to update the window after each cycle of this while loop we can use the update function of our window so window.update will also have this thread sleep for let's say 0.01 seconds so time dot sleep 0.01 one so here's a quick rundown of what we have going on so far within this while loop we're going to first get the coordinates of where our image is located we'll print the coordinates to the console window this part isn't required but it's going to help us for learning purposes we'll update this window for any changes and then our thread which is in charge of running the program is going to sleep for i believe that's a hundredth of a second so when we run this our image is staying in place and we know that our while loop is running because it's continuously printing the coordinates the first number is the x position the second number is the y position and now we're going to give our image a speed or velocity i like to call it velocity and in fact i'm going to give this image two velocities one for how fast this image is moving on the x-axis and another for how fast it's moving on the y axis so i'm going to create two variables one called x velocity and i'm going to set this equal to one and y velocity and i'll set this to one as well okay so what we need to do now is update the position of our image so let's do that before we update our window so i'm going to type in the name of the canvas and use the move function this move function takes three arguments what you want to move i want to move my image my ufo and how far i want to move this image on each axis each coordinate so what i want to do is update the x velocity the x position of my image so i'm going to pass in my x velocity variable and then y we'll just keep the same for now so we'll just say zero so after each iteration of this while loop my ufo is going to move one pixel to the right and it's just going to go off into the void forever and now if we replaced x velocity with zero and for y we set this to our y velocity this image is now going to travel down and it will continue into the void forever and then if we combine both of these together we're going to move diagonally down and to the right so what if we want this image to bounce off the walls we're going to add some if statements we're going to begin by just having this image bounce off the left and right walls for now let's set y velocity to zero so that this image is only moving left and right so before we move this image we'll add an if statement we're going to check to see if the x position of our image is either greater than the width of the canvas or if it's less than zero so we take our coordinates and we're going to get the first element from this list so that is zero that is x the x value if coordinates at element zero is greater than or equal to the width of this window and this is a constant so we can just place that here if coordinates well x within our coordinates is greater than or equal to width or coordinates at index 0 is less than 0 then we want to reverse the direction or flip the velocity so we want to change our x velocity and make this a negative number one easy way to do that is that we can take x velocity equals x velocity times negative one or another way of writing this is just to say x velocity minus negative velocity now what ends up happening is that when this image reaches the right border it's going to bounce back however it only bounces back after it reaches the top left corner of the image we need to factor in the width of the image as well so we're going to create two new variables and let's do this right before the while loop we'll want to determine what the height and the width are for our photo image that we have so this is what we're going to write let's call these two values image underscore width and image underscore height so we need to determine what the width and the height is for our photo image and there is a function to do that type in the name of the photo image dot and there is a width function and the same thing for height photo image dot height and then we can reuse these so i'm just going to add one line to the sift statement if the x position of our image is greater uh greater than or equal to the width of our window minus the width of our image and i'm just going to put these within parentheses just to keep these more organized and what ends up happening now is that when the right portion of our image hits the right wall it's going to bounce off and let's do the same thing for our y velocity we're going to replace coordinates at index 0 with 1 and change that here as well replace with with height and this is image underscore height and we're going to change the y velocity this time and when we move this image let's also add the y velocity and now our image is just going to bounce off the walls forever but it's kind of predictable since we set x and y to equal one now let's change the speeds to kind of spice things up let's say for the x velocity this is three and y velocity this is now two this is going to go in a completely different direction so you can mess with the speeds however you want so guys how about we add a background image to this well because we can i'm going to reuse this image of space from my java video on this same topic i need to create a photo image from this and i'm going to copy what we did for our normal image that we were moving and animating so this is called space.png well that's the name of my file and i'm going to give this image a different name maybe i'll call this background underscore photo and then i'm going to add this photo to the canvas and i'm going to call this a different name i'll just call this background all right so our window should have a background now and then our image moves on top of the background so make sure you add and create the background before you add any other images otherwise the background might overlap your image alright so that's the basics of some simple animations in python if you want to copy all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of some animations in python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can animate multiple objects in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show welcome back my fellow bros in this video we're going to be animating multiple objects within a window more specifically we'll animate some circles and each of these circles will have their own characteristics speeds and directions so we'll need two imports to begin from ck enter import everything we'll also be importing everything from the time module as well we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop i'm going to create two constants one for the width and one for the height let's set the width equal to 500 and the height equal to 500 as well we'll create a canvas and we'll be animating the circles that we're going to create on the canvas so let's create a canvas canvas equals canvas we're going to be adding the canvas to the window and we'll set the width of our canvas equal to our constant width which is 500 and our height equal to our constant of height which is also 500 and we will add this canvas by using the pack function canvas.pack here's our canvas and we're going to be creating multiple circles let's pretend that they're all different sports balls like a tennis ball baseball volleyball bowling ball they'll all be bouncing off of the borders and once each of them encounters a border they will change direction since we're going to be creating multiple objects i think it's best if we do this with another class so let's create another class i'm going to go to file new python file and let's call this class ball and click python file and we need to define this class class ball and we also need a constructor for this ball class we can create one with def two underscores i-n-i-t two underscores again and we can set up the parameters of what we want to receive if we were to create a ball object so let's pretend that we're going to be creating a volleyball to begin with so let's call this ball volley underscore ball equals ball and we'll pass in some arguments so let's set up the parameters first what do we want to receive one we want to receive our canvas so that we can actually draw this oval we can draw this ball we should also have an x and y position a diameter x velocity y velocity and a color all right so when we create a ball like a volleyball we're going to pass in whatever the parameters require so we need a canvas x y a diameter an x velocity y velocity and a color so within the constructor for the ball we're passing in our canvas it's kind of like what we do with widgets we're specifying what we're going to be adding this widget to we're going to be adding this ball to our canvas we also need x y and a diameter let's make this simple by setting x and y to both zero for the diameter let's set this to maybe 100 and we also need an x velocity and y velocity let's set this both to one and a color so let's pass in a string like white let's head back to our ball class and finish assigning all of these arguments that we're going to receive the first step is that we'll say self dot canvas equals the canvas that we receive when it's passed to us as an argument our next step is to draw this oval draw this ball and we'll say self dot image equals canvas dot create underscore oval and with creating ovals we can pass in x y and with circles the diameter is equal for both the width and the height so we'll pass in our diameter twice and lastly a fill color and we'll say this is equal to the color that we receive which is white we're going to set the x velocity and the y velocity this is related to the direction that it's initially going to head in so self dot x velocity equals the x velocity that we receive and we'll do the same thing for y velocity self.y velocity equals y velocity now since this is in another class we need to import this class from ball import everything and you can see that this red underline went away so let's see what happens now we have our volleyball but it's not currently moving so that's the next step so let's create a function within the ball class called move that we can call upon so we'll do this after the constructor cef move and this will take self as an argument the first thing that we should do is get the coordinates so we'll say coordinates and this is a list coordinates equals self dot canvas dot c o o rds and we'll pass in self dot image and we will print these coordinates just to see what's here all right now we'll create a while loop within our main class so let's add that near the end and we'll just say while true so while this is running let's move our volleyball so volleyball dot move so this will call the move function of our volleyball and then we will update the window window dot update so that this refreshes and we will sleep for maybe a hundredth of a second time dot sleep 0.01 but you can put whatever you want here so this is going to at first just print the coordinates of this ball so it's not currently moving and this time with our list we have four coordinates zero zero that's the top left corner and 100 100 that's the bottom right corner so this time we have four coordinates that we have to deal with the top left corner as well as the bottom right corner our next step is that we should move this image self dot canvas dot move what object are we going to move we're going to move self dot image and in what directions self.x velocity as well as self dot y velocity now our ball is going to move across the window and it right now it's displaying all of the coordinates we don't have any bounds set up so it's just going to continue into the void forever so we should set up some if statements to check to see if one of the borders touches one of the walls of the window if so it's going to change direction so let's check to see if the left or right side of our ball touches one of the left or right borders so let's write an if statement if and then let's take a look at these coordinates if coordinates at index 2 that is this one 0 1 2. so this is the bottom right corner with these two sets of coordinates if coordinates at index 2 is greater than or equal to i'm going to put these within parentheses self dot canvas and we need to get the width of the canvas one way which we can do that is to use the w info underscore with function so this is going to get the width of the canvas and then let's add one more thing or coordinates at index zero is less than zero so if this ball touches the left or right border we want to change direction so we can flip the x velocity self.x velocity equals negative self x velocity and let's do the same thing for the top and bottom borders so let's copy what we have and we'll replace coordinates at index two with three and we'll also replace w info underscore width with height and coordinates at index one change self dot x velocity with y velocity same thing here as well alright and that should be everything let's try it so let's see if this ball actually bounces off the borders which it does pretty cool so that's everything we need to do within our ball class now if we need to create multiple balls we can just construct them so let's say this time we would like a tennis ball i'm going to name this volleyball as tennis ball and let's make the diameter smaller like five but we'll make this a lot faster like for the velocity let's say four and three and the color let's make this yellow and we also need to call the move function of this tennis ball so within the while loop tennis ball dot move and then we should also have a tennis ball moving across the screen in a different direction now technically we don't need to print the coordinates but i tend to do that just for teaching purposes to better demonstrate all of this now our ball class is acting as a blueprint for how balls should be created and the behavior that they exhibit and if we need to create a ball we can just come up with a name for the ball and call the ball constructor to take care of that for us kind of like what we've been doing with widgets so all we need to do to create another ball is come up with a unique name for the ball and instantiate it using our ball class that we created so this time let's create a basketball i'll rename this as basketball and we'll pass in different arguments based on how we want to customize this unique ball so for the diameter let's say this is now 125 and the x and y velocity let's set this to something very fast like eight and seven and with the color let's change this to orange and make sure you also call the move function so basketball dot move and we should have a basketball moving across the screen all right everybody so that's the basics of animating multiple objects in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to animate multiple objects in python hey what's going on everybody it's ibro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a clock program in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show all right my fellow bros in this video we're going to be creating a clock gui program so we'll need a few imports from tk enter import everything and from time import everything as well we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and in this program we're going to be creating three separate labels one for the time another for the day of the week and another for the date so let's begin with just displaying the time and work on the day of the week and the date later so let's create a label for the time called time label equals label we're adding this to the window and let's set the font because we can i'm going to choose maybe ariel and then a size of 50 so that this is somewhat large i'm going to change the foreground color that is the font color and i will pick a hex value of green so that is 0 0 f 0 0 but feel free to pick whatever color you want and i'm also going to set the background color and you can pick a hex value or a color name i'm just going to say black and then i'm going to pack this label time label dot pack now we're going to call a function and we'll call this update and we'll define what this does after every second has passed we will use a recursive function to keep on updating the time every one second or so so let's define what this function does def update there is a function within the time module called strf time which we can use to return the current time and format it however we want so we're going to actually place this within a string variable and we'll call this time string and this function is strf time i'm actually going to go to python's website just to give you an example of how this works here we are on python's website and this is the strf time function and this converts a tuple representing a time as returned by gm time or local time to a string as specified by the format arguments so when we call this function we can pass in directives as arguments based on what we want to display if we want to display the current time there is a few directives that we can pass in so let's say that we want a 12 hour clock as represented by a decimal number between 1 and 12 well we would pass in percent i as an argument if we want the minutes that would be right here percent m and if we want the seconds that is percent s so we're going to pass in these directives as if they are arguments so within this function we'll pass in those format specifiers or directives so i want percent i followed by percent m and percent s alright uh but these also have to be within quotes so don't forget that because i just did okay this will display the current time oh then we also have to update our time label so time label dot config text equals our time string because remember that this returns a string of text text equals time string so this will display the current time and right now it is six in the morning or so however we just get one long jumbled number so it would be a good idea if we separated some of these numbers so within our strf time function i'm just going to add some colons to separate these values and this will display the current time it is currently 6 46 in the morning let's add am or pm to the end of this so the directive for that is percent lowercase p 6 46 am now how do we update this label every one second to reflect the current time well that's a good question and i'm glad you asked it so we're going to use the time labels after function we pass in a delay and then a function that we want to call after that delay so let's say we want to call this function update every 1000 milliseconds or one second so we'll pass in the delay as an argument 1000 milliseconds and the function that we want to call and we're going to perform what is known as a recursive function we're going to call a function within itself so after 1000 seconds we're going to call update again and it's going to repeat the process it's going to return the time and format that time and update our label with the new time so what ends up happening now is that our clock is going to update every 1000 milliseconds now let's add a few other labels let's say the day of the week i'm going to copy what we have here and let's rename this as day label but i probably don't want this to be the same size for the font let's say ink free because i like that font and a size of maybe 25 and i'll get rid of the coloring it's the same process as before really so let's replace time string with day string the directive for strf time to display the day of the week is percent a and we're going to replace time label with day label text equals day string and this will display the day of the week and it is currently wednesday and if we want to display the current date we can create a label and we'll call this date label and i'll make the font slightly bigger maybe 30. we'll copy what we have for our day string and rename this as date string so we have a few options for the date i want to display the name of the month the day and then the year so that would be percent capital b percent lowercase d i'm going to add a comma to separate the day and the year and percent capital y and then i want to set the text of my date label to my date string so that this will now display the current date there's just one quick change that i think we should make right now we have three different labels a time label a day label and a date label and right now we're using the after function of the time label so since we have all of these different labels i think we should replace time label with our window because our window has an after function as well so that after 1000 milliseconds has passed we can update the time the day of the week and the date all right so that's the basics of creating a simple clock program in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating a clock in python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can send an email using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show oh a quick note for you all you're going to need a gmail account to sign into as well as your username and password so once you have those set you're ready to begin all right let's begin by importing the simple mail transfer protocol library we'll need a couple variables to hold strings let's say we have a sender a receiver a password a subject for your email as well as a body for the email okay sender is going to be you sending the email so enter your email in here i'm just going to make up one you at gmail.com actually sender would be better i would say let me change that sender at gmail.com let's say we have a receiver this is who you're going to send the email to receiver gmail.com don't actually enter in these emails use your owner the person that you intend to send the email to for your test because these will probably not work i'm assuming then enter the password for your gmail account so let's say password123 and a subject uh let's say python email test and a body what do you want to say within your email i wrote an email okay so that should be good so remember that you're going to want to change these to your actual gmail account and you'll want to send it to a valid email address too and make sure that you use your password for your gmail account okay now we're going to create a header for our email and the syntax on this is a little strange we're going to say message f and then triple quotes so what this triple quotes is is that a triple quote string can span multiple lines of text so the first thing we'll enter is from within our header from and then since we're using an f-string we can insert a variable at a given location when we insert a pair of these curly braces so from will be sender the next line to colon receiver then the next line subject colon subject this will be the title of the email then i'm going to add a new line and then insert the body and if you want you can give yourself a name when you send this email let's say maybe snoop dogg and if there's somebody you want to send the email to and give them a name you can say like nicholas cage but these aren't necessary okay so we have our header completed let me just add a note that this is our header okay we're going to create a server object server equals smtplib.smtp there are two arguments the first is smtp the other argument is the port number and that is going to be 587 that is the default mail submission port 587 now we're going to take our server object and start tls transport layer security okay now we need to log in so server dot login we will pass in our sender email that's us as well as our password password and let's print logged in we'll eventually place all this within a try and accept block later all right and then to send an email type server dot send mail and we pass in our self sender receiver and our message sender comma receiver comma message and let's print a confirmation print email has been sent now if you were to run this program you may encounter this error smtp authentication error that either means your username password combination was not correct or you need to turn on the less secure app access on your gmail account which you can find here however i would recommend turning that back off when you're done with this program just because your account will be less secure and i'm not liable if you get hacked hey you know what let's place this code within a try block we will try all of this code and then if we encounter this exception we can catch and handle it properly so we will try these four lines of code and we will handle our exception of smt lib dot smtp authentication error that means we could not sign in so let's print unable to sign in so i'm going to run this one more time and instead of getting that ugly error we should get a simple message that says unable to sign in once you have the proper username password combination for your gmail account and if you need to set less secure app access to on but make sure that you turn it back off when you're done with this you should be able to send an email let's try it logged in email has been sent here is a snapshot of the email that i received i blurred out my actual email because i don't want it public because some of you guys are weird so we have our sender our receiver and i gave myself a nickname of snoop dogg that's why it says snoop to nicholas the receiver but you don't actually need a name for these as long as you have the sender and receiver fields filled in you should be good we have our subject python email test as well as our body i wrote an email well everybody that's how to write and send a simple email using python if you would like a copy of this code i will post this to the comment section down below but yeah that's how to send a simple email using python hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can run a python file using command prompt so sit back relax and enjoy the show hey y'all in today's video i'm going to show you all how we can run a python file with command prompt so first we'll need a script to work with let's just make a very simple program let's say print hello world and then maybe we will ask for some user input name equals input what's your name and then at the end we will print the word hello plus the user's name okay so let's save this to a place that will remember perhaps my desktop now to save this file to a separate location go to file save as you can pick a name for this python file then to directory click these three dots and pick a location you want to save this to to make this easy i'm going to save this python file to my desktop and then click ok so the name of this python file of mine is hello underscore world dot py then click ok now our second step is to open command prompt to open command prompt just search for cmd if you're using mac i believe it's terminal step number three is that we need to navigate to the directory that contains our python file i saved this python file to my desktop so if you right click on your file and go to location you can just copy this address now within command prompt type cd to change directory space and then paste that directory that contains your python file hit enter and for the last step we need to invoke the python interpreter by typing python space and then the name of the script and the name of my script is hello underscore world dot p y hit enter to run the script hello world what is your name bro hello bro so that is how to run a python file with command prompt i will post all of these notes to the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to run a python file with command prompt it's you bro hope you're all doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can use pip for python to download packages and modules so sit back relax and enjoy the show alright people pip for python pip is a package manager for packages and modules from the python package index if you're using python version 3.4 or above pip should already be installed if you're using a python version below 3.4 one option is that you can always update your version of python just click download open when done go to customize installation make sure that pip is checked go to next and add python to environment variables then install now to use pip open up command prompt and type pip for a help menu all sorts of different general options and commands will appear if you need to check your version of pip type this command and here's a cheat sheet that i wrote so to check the current version of pip type pip dash dash version enter and currently the version that i'm using is 21 if you need to upgrade pip use this command pip install dash dash up grade pip mine should be the latest version yeah requirement already satisfied and if you need a list of installed packages type pip list so here's all of the packages that i currently have installed some of these you might recognize like numpy pie game pie installer those are just a few to check to see if any of your packages are outdated type pip list dash dash outdated and this might take a second here are four packages that are outdated on my computer babel pi game pi tz and setup tools if you need to upgrade one of your packages type pip install the name of the package let's say that i would like to update pygame then dash dash upgrade i just realized that in my notes i'm missing updated package so i just added that here now you can see that pie game has successfully updated and let's just check to see if it has by using pip list outdated pip list dash dash outdated and pi game is no longer in here so it is up to date and if you would like to install a package type hip install and the name of the package you would like to download let's say i would like to download pandas pip install the name of the package in this case pandas two valley boring minutes later and it's done so i should now have pandas installed and let me check pip list and here it is i have successfully downloaded the package of pandas so those are a few commands for pip and if you're interested in downloading more packages head to python's package index on second thought i should probably show you all where that is python's package index is located at pipi.org and you can do a search for all sorts of different projects and packages so everybody that is pip4 python i will post my notes in the comments section down below and well yeah that's how to use pip for python hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can convert a python file to an executable so sit back relax and enjoy the show here's a quick disclaimer before we begin windows defender and other anti-virus programs may prevent your executable from running but if you head to the settings section of your anti-virus you can disable that so that your python file can run also please be sure that pip and pi installer are both installed and up to date i have a separate video on that if you're interested now the program that i'm going to be converting to an executable has a gui portion to it i created a clock program in a previous video so i'm going to turn this clock program into an executable now i recommend creating a new folder on your desktop just because this process is normally somewhat messy so we'll create a folder to contain it all now copy any relevant python files and or images and paste them to within this folder if you have an image that you would like to set as an icon for your executable i recommend moving that to the same folder as well our next step is to open command prompt and we need to change the directory of command prompt so that it's pointing to that folder that contains our python file so on your python file right click on it go to properties and copy this location and in command prompt to change directory type cd space and then paste that location now here's the cheat code to convert a python file to an executable make sure that pi installer and pip are installed and both up to date so type pi installer dash capital f to make all of this one file if you need the terminal window in your program then omit this next part since i'm running a gui application i do not need that terminal window so to remove that window type dash w if you have an icon that you want to set type dash i and the name of your icon however it should be an ico file so if you have some other image that you would like to convert to an ico file here's how if you need to convert an image to an ico file you can just google convert to ico but one website that i commonly use is icoconvert.com just pick a file to upload so choose file i'm going to convert this png file of an alarm clock upload it there is a bunch of different settings you can use convert ico and then download my icon and once your ico file is downloaded i will drag and drop it to my folder and i will rename this let's rename this as icon dot ico and here's that cheat code one more time pi installer dash f dash w if you do not need the terminal window dash i if you would like to add an icon the name of your icon it should be an ico file followed by the name of the python file and mine is named clock.p.y then hit enter alright looks like building our executable has completed successfully so open that folder back up your executable is located within this dist folder i would recommend just dragging and dropping it to your desktop and we can get rid of this old folder but close out a command prompt and by clicking on this executable this executable will now run my python program well everyone that is how to convert a python file to an exe file i will post my notes to the comment section down below and well yeah that's how to convert a python file to an executable what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create a basic calculator using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show let's create a calculator after importing tkinter we'll need to define three separate functions our first function will be named button press and there is one parameter which we will call num we're not going to fill this in quite yet we'll get back to it later we'll use pass as a placeholder we'll also need an equals function to calculate our expression and a function to clear our calculator okay that's it for our three functions let's create a window window equals tk and at the end of our program we'll write window.mainloop let's set a title window dot title calculator programs good but make sure you spell title right and let's set a geometry of 500 500 should be decent now we're going to create a string named equation text equals a set of quotes this will effectively be empty for the time being and we'll need to create a string var and i will call this equation label equals string var let's create a label label equals label we're adding our label to our window i will set our text variable equal to our equation label you can pick a font if you wish i'll set the background color equal to white a width of 24 and a height of two and we need to finish this by using label dot pack and we should have a blank label within our calculator this will display our numbers that we're entering in or our expression okay this is the tedious part we have to create all of the buttons and i think we should place these all within a frame frame equals frame we're adding our frame to our window frame dot pack now let's create button one we'll do some copying and pasting later so it's not as tedious so button one equals button we're adding our button to our frame i'll set the text equal to 1 the height equal to 4 and the width equal to 9 and a font size of 35 okay we'll need a command command equals i'll write a lambda function here lambda we will call button press i think i'm going to put this on the next line just so it's easier to read button press and we will pass in the number one and we need to add our button to our frame button one dot grid and i'm going to set a row equal to zero and a column equal to zero and let's just test it okay let's add the other buttons i'm going to copy and paste everything that we have for button one and change button one to button two set the text equal to two pass into to button press and for the row and column i'm going to set the column equal to one but keep row the same okay button three it's gonna be the same process really so text equals three button press three row zero column two and button four text equals four button press four column actually let's set this to row one column zero and i need to change that too okay let's just double check this okay button five so button five text equals five button press five and let's set column equal to one okay number six i told you all this is going to be tedious okay so row one column two button seven okay so row two column two actually let's change that to column zero much better okay button eight eight eight eight eight row two column one number nine row two column two and lastly zero so button zero text equals zero button press pass in zero and this will be row three column zero okay not too bad now let's fill in some of the symbols so we need plus i'm just going to rename this as plus the text will equal the plus sign put that within quotes and button press will be plus oh and we should probably put this in a row and column so let's say row 0 column three so it should be on the right hand side here okay we need minus let's change plus to minus and place this at row one column three we need multiply that is an asterisk row two column three and divide that is a forward slash row three column three i promise we're near the end of creating these buttons we'll need an equal sign let's say equal equal text is the equal sign and our command is going to be equals the function and this will be row 3 column 2. we need a decimal let's change the text to a decimal row three column one okay and lastly we just need a clear button let's put this at the bottom so clear clear let's set the text equal to the word clear and the command will be our clear function and i think i'm going to pack this at the end but let's change frame to window okay let's check out all these buttons okay not too bad i think i'm going to change the width on our clear button so it's a little bit wider let's change the width to 12. that's a little bit better okay let's fill in some of these functions let's start with button press we're going to state global equation text then our equation text is equal to equation text plus we're converting whatever number or symbol that we receive to a string and our equation label which is a string var will be set to our equation text and let's test this so we can type in any combination of numbers or symbols okay let's work on our equals function next so let's say global equation text total equals eval now eval will parse the expression that we pass in equation text and our equation label will be set to whatever our total is and if we want to reuse our total let's set our equation text equal to total 2 plus 2 equals four minus three equals one times five equals five divided by two equals two point five now what if we divide by zero well we'll run into that ugly zero division error so let's write our code within a try and accept block so i'm going to indent some of this and let's write try all of this code and we will catch a zero division error exception so accept zero division error and i will set our equation label set let's say arithmetic error equation text equals a set of quotes okay so we should be able to catch this exception now five divided by zero equals arithmetic error now what if we have a syntax here like we type in just a bunch of symbols and hit equals we'll probably want to catch the syntax error as well so let's write an additional accept block before zero division error or after i guess it doesn't matter accept syntax error let's change arithmetic to syntax and we can keep equation text the same so now our program won't crash if we type in a bunch of symbols syntax error now let's work on the clear button so that is within the clear function so we will set global equation text equation label dot set to a set of quotes to effectively clear it and our equation text equal to a set of quotes as well and that should be it for this program let's run this one last time let's say 3.14 times 2.1 equals 6.594 divided by 2.1 equals 3.14 minus one i'm just making up numbers here plus ten equals twelve point one four and let's clear this and start again one plus two plus three plus four equals ten i think that's good enough all right everybody so that's how to create a basic calculator in python i will post all of my code in the comments section down below if you would like a copy for yourself but yeah that's how to create a basic calculator using python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how we can build a basic text editor program in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show okay people let's create a text editor here's all the different imports that you'll need and we'll begin by defining all of the different functions that we'll need so let's say we have a change color function to change the color of our font and for all of these functions i'm going to write pass as a placeholder so we have change font and this function will accept a varying amount of arguments so we'll use that args keyword we will need to open a file new file open file save file cut copy paste yeah there's a lot of functions here about this is for an about section and lastly quit so how many do we have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten functions let's create the main window that we're gonna work with window equals tk and at the very end window.main loop okay so let's create a title for this window window title notepad program i guess or maybe text editor program would be more appropriate text editor program okay and we will need a file to work with and i'll declare that now file equals none we'll need a window width and height window with equals 500 is good and a height okay so let's attempt to center this window because right now it just appears to the side so our next step is to get the screen width equals window dot w info screen width and i'll copy this for screen height okay so we need to figure out how much we're going to move our window on the x and y axis so let's say x equals screen width divided by 2 minus window width divided by two and we're going to cast all of this to an end so add an inch cast around this let's copy this do the same thing for y except this will be screen height and window height okay let's set the geometry for the window window geometry i'm going to use a string format method so let's say these will be placeholders for our values so we have window width for the first value window height x and y so this should be near the middle cool we're going to create a string var variable to hold the font name font name equals string var and pass in your window and you can set this to what do you want your default font to be so let's say font name dot set and then pick a font i'll use ariel i think let's create a font size string bar as well we're going to add this to the window and we can set a default size perhaps 25. okay let's create a text area text area equals text we're adding this to the window i'm going to set a font equal to font name dot get the name of the font that we want to use will be the font that we set within our font name string var so now we'll use a size of font size dot get font size dot get okay now we need a scroll bar scroll bar equals scroll bar writing this to our text area so pass that in and i'm going to configure my window using grid row configure this will allow our text area to expand but we're going to set a weight equal to 1 so that it doesn't back expand and then we need column configure okay and text area dot grid i'm going to use the sticky keyword and this will stick north plus east plus south plus west so my text area should take most of the window this is some sample text hooray so it goes down to the next line once it runs out of room on one line unless you resize the window which is exactly what we wanted let's create a scroll bar while we already created it we just have to add a few details to it so that will be near the bottom and why don't we say scroll bar dot pack side equals right fill equals y and then we just have to configure our text area with the scroll bar so text area dot config y scroll command equals scroll bar dot set so that should work but let's test it to be sure okay i'm just going to type a bunch of f's okay look at that our scroll bar works cool okay let's head to this portion and we'll create a bunch of buttons well a button an option menu and a spin box for the font color the size and the font style so i'm going to place all of these different widgets within a frame frame equals frame add it to the window and then i'm going to use frame dot grid okay let's create a color button to change the fonts color color button equals button i'll add my button to my frame i'll set the text of the button equal to color and i will associate a command of change color which we have already defined at the top where is it at the top here change color and then actually that's it for this portion so then we need to add this button color button dot grid i'll set the row equal to zero and the column equal to zero so let's be sure that this appears make sure you spell grid right okay and we have a color button but this button doesn't do anything so let's head to the change color function within the change color function we're going to say color equals color chooser dot ask color and you can set a title to pick a color or else you don't technically need a title and then text area dot config oh i should probably print this color so let me do that um i'm just gonna explain something here so this color is going to be i believe a tuple so let's print it so let's say that i would like white okay so we have a tuple we just need one of these values not both of them so i'm going to say text area dot config foreground equals our color but we do not want to assign a tuple to our color we just need one of these values so let's say i would like this hex value so i'm going to say at index 1 and let's try it color perhaps i would like my text pink for some reason so we're going with pink this is some text i suppose and we can change this back too by using this color button now i would like blue and we have blue text okay so that is the change color function i'm going to minimize this because we do not need it anymore okay we're going to change the font next so head to the portion of our code right after the color button and we'll create an option menu to list all of the different fonts available to us so let's say font box equals option menu we're adding this to our frame we need to set a variable a string var so that will be our font name that we declared up here now here's a trick to add all of the fonts as options to our option menu we can use the unpacking operator which is an asterisk followed by font dot families and then call this function so this will return all of the different fonts available to us and we just need to set a command and when we use our option menu we'll call change font and we need to add our font box to our grid row equals zero and column equals one so this should be on the right hand side of our color button yeah it's going to look something like that and you can see the default is arial that we set and we can change it to something else like comic sans or whatever uh however it's not going to change it quite yet so that'll be the change font function before we fill in the change font function there's another widget that's going to share the same command of change font so we should create that next so our next widget is a spin box which i will name sizebox this will be in charge of increasing or decreasing the font so size box equals spin box we're adding the spin box to our frame and we'll set a range so from underscore you have to add that underscore it's kind of weird this is the range of our spin box for the font size from 1 to let's say 100 the text variable will be font size and our command equals change font so when we use our spin box and call this command of change font it's going to pass in our font size as an argument whereas with option menu it doesn't pass any arguments that's why with our change font function we're accepting a varying amount of arguments because one's going to pass in an argument and the other isn't and we just need to add our spin box so that would be size box dot grid row equals zero and column equals two so we should have a spin box right on the bottom and it's set to 25 that was our default for our font size string var which we set as the text variable okay so we can fill in this function of change font now which will apply both to our option menu and our spin box so that is all the way at the top within the change font function we're going to take our text area dot config set the font equal to font name dot get and the size will be size box dot get and that's it for this function i'll minimize it for now and let's test it this is some sample text hey how you doing good looking okay so let's change the font uh let's pick comic sans or whatever you want and we can increase or decrease the size and we can change the color how about red this time all right nice now let's add a menu bar at the top so we can save this file or open a file or create a new file and some other stuff on second thought i'm going to move these two last lines of code to this section here where we create our scroll bar just so that it's more organized okay so at the bottom let's create various drop-down menus so we'll need a menu bar to begin with so let's say menu bar equals menu we're adding this to our window make sure that's capital by the way and window dot config menu equals menu bar so we'll create a file menu edit menu and a help menu so let's begin with the file menu to add to the menu bar file menu equals menu we're adding this to our menu bar and set a tear off equal to zero we'll need a cascade for it to actually be a drop down menu so that will be menu bar dot add cascade label equals file comma menu equals file menu let's see if anything appears yet yep so we have a file menu but there's nothing to drop down yet so we need some options well commands technically file menu dot add command label equals new and the command will equal our new file function actually i'll put these together okay so let's copy this and paste it we have open the command will be open file we have save the command will be save file and i'll add a separator file menu dot add separator and lastly we will have exit command quit okay let me show you what this looks like so here's our drop down menu that separator is this bold line going across so if i was to remove this then we wouldn't have that bolt line you can keep it in or get rid of it do whatever you want and this is the tear off so i'm going to remove the tear off and you get this like tear off line at the top i guess it's the default i usually don't like it so i set tear off equal to zero so that is our file menu let's work on a edit menu edit menu equals menu menu bar make sure that's capital two tare off equals zero we'll need a cascade menu bar dot add cascade label equals edit menu equals edit menu edit menu dot add command label equals cut to cut some text command equals copy actually that's cut my bad okay next is copy so let's copy this and paste it cut copy we have paste command paste all right let's take a look oh make sure you spell label right okay there we go okay so we can cut copy and paste and lastly we should have a help menu help menu equals menu menu bar tear off equals zero i think i'll copy this for my cascade so menu bar dot add cascade help menu equals help menu what we'll be doing for a command is that we'll be creating an about section that will bring up a pop-up window if you need to display any like help information or anything uh so let's say about and the command will be about okay let's take a look so we have help and we'll have an about section that will tell you more about this program but we need to work on some of these functions let's head to the quit function this one's fairly easy this is found within the file menu window dot destroy that will close out of the window so go to file then exit to exit the program we don't need it anymore so let's minimize this okay let's go to the about function let's bring up a message box show info this first argument is the title so let's say about this program and the text will be whatever you want to tell the user about this program this is a program written by you okay so we should have a pop-up window when you go to help then about about this program this is a program written by you the next function is the paste function so we can paste some text text area dot event generate and the event is going to be within quotes and double angle brackets paste let's copy this and change paste to copy and then cut okay so we should be able to cut copy and paste hey how's it hanging okay let's highlight this edit copy let's move down to the next line and paste and we should be able to cut as well edit cut nice head to the new file function and we'll set the title of our window to maybe untitled until we save something so untitled and i need to delete any text within our text area text area dot delete and we need to set a range so this has to be a floating point number the first character until the end let's try it so i'll write some sample text and we are going to go to file new that changed the title and it deleted our text so that is the new file function let's work on open file we are now within the open file function and we'll say file equals ask open file name so we have a default extension if you would like one default i think i spelled that wrong extension equals let's say a txt file comma what are the accepted file types i'll set this equal to all files comma and then we need asterisk dot asterisk for all file types as well as text documents so these are what is accepted when we look for a file so we have either all files or all text documents text documents comma asterisk dot txt okay so then let's try some code we'll set our window title equal to os dot path dot base name of our file so that we will change the title of the window to match whatever the file is that we opened then let's take our text area delete what's currently here from one until the end take our file use the open function open our file and read it so pass in our text area dot insert beginning at index of 1.0 file dot read that you can catch any exceptions to i'll just write accept exception but it's better to name specific exceptions i'll just print couldn't read file and we should close our file at the end within a finally block finally file dot close we'll need a sample file to read so i'm going to create a new file on my desktop i'll call this test.txt and let's write something whoa you can actually read this awesome okay let's save close out of it add run our program file open test.txt open whoa you can actually read this awesome nice so we know that the open function is working if we need to create a new file just go to file new and that will delete our old text so lastly we have save file underneath the save file function file equals file dialog dot ask save as file name so this will be the default name for the file but you can change that initial file equals let's say untitled dot you txt set a default extension default extension equals let's say txt file types equals all files comma then asterisk dot asterisk for all file types and any text documents text documents asterisk dot txt okay if file is none that's if they close out of our file dialog we'll just return else so we'll set the window title first window title os dot path dot base name file file equals open open our file and write file dot right take our text area and get the text from index one through the end catch any exceptions it's better to name them instead of just doing a general accept exception but i'm just going to print couldn't save file and finally close our file file dot close all right so let's test it so i'm going to change the font i wonder if impact is in here yes it is i'll change the font size maybe 30 and i'll pick a color how about this swamp green color okay so write something perhaps some lyrics to a song you like i should probably test copying and pasting edit copy edit paste nice all right let's actually try and save this now i'll go to file save the default file name is untitled because we set it to that i'll say all star lyrics and save now i should be able to open this so i'm going to go to my desktop here's that text file i'm going to open it and here are the lyrics that i wrote within my text editor and let's try and read this so let's go to file open find your text document open and would you look at that my lyrics are still here however this program doesn't save the font so i thought of a fun last minute project that we can do we can actually use our text editor to write a python file much like what we do with pycharm so let's write a program using our text editor program it'll be just a simple program let's print hello world and ask for some user input let's say name equals input what's your name and we will print hello plus our name variable and you can change the font and everything too if you want okay so let's save this file save i'll save this to my desktop but make sure you save it as a py file a python file i'll name this as hello dot py and save now to run a file using command prompt we need to find the directory that contains our python file mine is hello.py and it's located on my desktop so i need the location right click go to properties you can copy the location then within command prompt or terminal you can change directory by typing cd space and then paste your new directory the new location enter then to run a python program type python space and then the name of the program the python file mine is hello dot py hit enter hello world what is your name bro hello bro i just thought that would be a fun last minute project that we can do you don't even technically need an ide to write a python program screw you pycharm well everyone that is a basic text editor program i will post the code for this program in the comment section down below and well yeah that's a basic text editor program using python all right ladies and gentlemen let's create a game of tic-tac-toe to begin we'll need to import tkinter as well as random and let's begin by defining all of the different functions that we'll need let's define a function named next turn for the time being we'll just write pass we'll fill this in later on we'll need a function named check winner a function named empty spaces to check if there are any empty spaces left and lastly a function named new game that will launch a new game for us okay we have our four functions now let's create a window let's create a window window equals tk and at the end of our program we need to use window dot main loop and when we run this we should have just a small basic window let's set the title window dot title let's set this to tick tack toe we'll need a list of players players equals x comma o and with the way that we're writing this program we can swap these symbols with a different character for example we could say dollar sign is playing against the at symbol too but i'll demonstrate that later let's keep it as x and o for now now we need to select a random player to begin player equals random dot choice and pass in our list of players now we'll need nine buttons i'm going to create a 2d list of buttons named buttons and this will be the first row this will be the second row for the time being i'm just going to initialize these with 0 for everything and put these all within a list so we have a 2d list named buttons and to better visualize this i'm going to place each row on a new line so that's what our board is going to look like we have a 2d list named buttons we'll need a label to display whose turn it is label equals label i'll set the text equal to player plus the word turn and i'll set the font to font equals pick whatever font that you want and i am going to pack this label label dot pack and set the side equal to top and let's run this just to test it okay looks like it's x's turn let's try it again oh stern okay that's fine for now let's create a reset button reset underscore button equals button i'll set the text equal to restart it's going to be a restart button or reset button pick a font maybe i'll set the size to 20 and we'll need a command command equals new game when we click on this button it's going to call this new game function for us and we need to pack this button reset button dot pack and i will set the side equal to top okay let's see if that appears alright so we have our turn order a label that will display whose turn it is as well as our reset button now we'll need to create all of the buttons to add to our 2d list named buttons but i'm going to place these all within a frame frame equals frame we're adding our frame to our window and i'm going to pack this frame frame dot pack now we'll take our 2d list of buttons and add a button to each spot and i think the best way to do this would be to use nested for loops we'll have an outer for loop in charge of the rows four row in range three remember we only have three rows and three columns the inner for loop will be in charge of the columns four column and range three and inside the inner for loop we're going to create a new button we'll say buttons at index row and column we have two indexes because we have a 2d list so buttons at row whatever column whatever depending on what iteration we are within our for loops we'll create a new button and we'll set the text oh first add this to the frame almost forgot about that we're adding our buttons to our frame and adding the frame to the window now we'll set the text equal to a blank set of quotes because we don't want any text we'll set the font i'll just copy what we have here for label for a width let's say five and a height let's say two i'm going to hit enter just to move down to the next line because we still have a few more things to fill in okay we'll need a command command equals and i'm going to set this equal to a lambda function so we need some arguments actually i think i'll pass in some keyword arguments row equals row and column equals column then our expression is next turn and we will pass in row and column now we also need to add our buttons to our frame buttons at index of row and column we'll use the grid function for this grid row equals and column equals column and it's always a good idea to test your program after making any major changes so we should have our label our reset button and our grid of buttons now that the main body of our program is complete let's head to the next turn function and remember that we're passing in row and column as arguments so we need to set up those parameters within the next turn function row and column and the first line within here we would like access to our player so let's say global player so that we have access to it and we're first going to check to see if the button that we click on is empty so buttons at index of row and index of column to access the text of a button just add a third index operator and type in text if the text of our button that we click is equal to a set of quotes that means it's empty and when we call check winner winner winner chicken dinner and it's false there is no winner then we will fill in that button with our player our player's character whatever it is x or o or whatever we decide so within here let's check to see if player is equal to players at index zero that is our first player and remember that we created a list of players and we're planning on swapping these later we could say like if player is equal to x but that would make our program less flexible if we want to pick like a different character instead of an x so if player is equal to player at index zero whatever symbol is there then we are going to take buttons at index of row index of column take our text and set it equal to our player and we should check to see if there's a winner after filling in this button if check winner and we still need to fill in this function returns false then we will switch players player equals players at index of one and label dot config text equals players at index 1 plus the word turn so what we did here is that we're checking to see if after placing our text of our player on that button that we click if there is no winner then we're going to swap players player equals our next player and we're configuring our label so that it displays the next player's turn players at index 1 turn now what if there is a winner let's say else if check winner is true then we will take our label dot config and set the text equal to players at index 0 plus the word wins now let's add another else if statement else if there's a tie let's say check winner is equal to the word tie because we are already using false and true then let's change our label and i'm just going to copy this text equals the word tie okay so let's create an else block so that goes right here so if it's not player one's turn player at index zero then it's our other player's turn player at index of one so oh then so we just need to mostly just copy this text and change a few things around so i'm going to copy all this and within here let's set player equals players at index zero then players at index zero's turn players at index one wins and that is it now our next turn function is now complete let's head down to the check winner function and we need to check all of the different win conditions and return it true if somebody won false if there is yet no winner and the word tie if it's a tie so let's check all of the horizontal win conditions so we can do this using a for loop for row in range three we need to check the text of each button in each row if buttons at index of row and column index of 0 we'll use the index operator to check the text is equal to the next button in our row so i will copy this and change zero to one check to see if that is equal to buttons at index of row index of two and i'm going to check to see if this is all not equal let me move this a little bit to a space so if that is the case that means somebody won so if all of these buttons are the same and they are not equal to an empty space that means they're all the same so let's return true that means that somebody won no we need to check the vertical win conditions if anybody has the same character all the way down a single column this next for loop is going to be four column in range three for the first button this will be button at index of zero and column then one and column let me just paste that and two and column now we need to check the diagonal win conditions so if buttons at index 0 0 that's the top left corner if the text of that button is equal to buttons at indexes of one one is equal to the indexes of button two two and if all of this does not equal an empty space then return true so there is a winner and we have one last win condition to check that is the other diagonal win condition so we just need to change some of these indexes around so we have zero two one one and two zero i'm going to change this statement to an else if statement no we need to check to see if there's any spaces remaining else if we will call the empty spaces function which we have yet to fill in if this returns false then we will return the word tie and lastly else else there is no winner and no tie so we will return false and that is it for the check winner function let's test this so this doesn't account for a tie quite yet but we can fill in some of these spaces looks like x wins and we can no longer fill in buttons and we cannot start a new game quite yet either within the empty spaces function let's create a local variable named spaces and set this equal to nine whenever we call this function four row in range three and we'll create a nested for loop for column in range three we will check the text of each button if buttons at indexes of row and column and we will check the text to see if it's not equal to an empty space if that is the case spaces minus equals one then we'll write an if statement if spaces as in spaces remaining is equal to zero that means we will return false and there are no spaces left else we will return true okay let's test it so this time i'm trying to get a tie yep looks like it's a tie this next part's optional but i would like to change the color of each button for the winning combination so within our check winner function underneath the first win condition i'm going to take buttons at index of row and index of zero use the config method and set the background color equal to let's say green and i'm going to repeat this process for the other buttons within this win condition so that is row zero row one and row two i'll copy all of this paste it and switch some of these around so these should all be matching so zero and column one and column and two in column okay so we have zero zero one one and two two and one more zero two one one and two zero now when we have a winning combination the color of the buttons involved in that combination are going to change to green now if there is a tie let's change all of the buttons to let's say yellow so i'm going to write nested for loops for this four row in range three for column in range three take our buttons at row and column and change the background color to yellow or some other color of your choosing so if there's a tie they should all be yellow i'm trying not to win here it's actually more complex than what i thought yep it looks like it's all a tie and the last thing that we need to do is to fill in the new game function so that we can begin a new game so let's say global player we would like access to our player from inside this function and set player equal to a new random choice random dot choice and pass in our list of players and we will change our label label dot config and set the text equal to player plus the word turn and we also need to reset all of our buttons for row in range three for column in range three buttons at index of row and index of column dot config text equals a set of quotes so it's empty and we'll change the background color factors previously so the default color for buttons is actually hexadecimal f 0 f 0 f 0 so this function will begin a new game for us and let's test it to be sure i'm going to start a new game reset reset i'll actually try and win this time and reset okay so it looks like the new game function is working now another thing that you can do too is that you can change the players around let's say we would like to play as dollar sign and at sign so this program is flexible enough so that you can change the icons of the players all right everybody so that's a basic game of tic-tac-toe for python if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this to the comments section down below but yeah that's how to code a basic game of tic-tac-toe for python hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to create a game of snake using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show first thing we should do is import from tkinter as well as the random module and let's define all of the different classes and functions that we'll need so let's create a class for our snake object as well as our food object so for the time being i'm just going to write pass for my classes we'll fill these in later so we have class snake and class food and let's define all of the different functions that we'll need so let's say we have a function named next turn change direction check collisions and lastly game over okay for change direction i'm going to have one parameter a new direction now when i create a game i like to place a bunch of constants at the top of my game constants are variables that you do not want to change later they're kind of like the settings however in python there are no constants compared to other programming languages so we're just going to create a bunch of variables that will behave like them so constants are values we do not want to change and they're kind of like the game settings and i placed them at the top for convenience and the naming convention for a constant is that all the letters are uppercase so these will be settings like the game width the speed etc so let's say the width of our game will be 700 but feel free to take the liberty to pick whatever size you want so we have game width game height i'll set this to 700 as well so it's a square let's say we have a speed the speed of the snake how often will our canvas update so let's say 50 but the lower the number the faster the game and a space size how large are the items in our game like the food and body parts of the snake so i'm going to pick 50 but you can change this and body parts how many body parts does our snake have when we begin a game let's say three how about a snake color you can pick a color name you can use rgb values or you can use a hexadecimal value so i'm going to pick green 0 0 ff00 but you can pick any color you want how about food color equals red and that is ff000 and what about a background color for the canvas background color i'll pick black so that is six zeros feel free to mess with some of these colors too so we have a green snake our food is going to be red and our background is going to be black so that is all of the constants for our game but you can feel free to adjust them if you like let's head down to the bottom and make our window so we have window equals tk and at the very end we should have window dot main loop let's set a title for this window window dot title snack game okay fine i'll spell it right snake game and if you do not want your window to be resizable you can use resizable and then you have to pass in false twice it's kind of strange but it's how it is okay we should have a small window and we cannot resize this even if we tried okay let's create a score label but we probably need a score first so let's say score equals zero and an initial direction direction equals let's say down now let's create a score label so let's say label equals label we're adding our label to our window let's set the text equal to score colon then i'm going to use the format method and we will pass in our score whatever it is and i'll set a font pick whatever font you prefer and 40 is a decent size and then i'm going to pack this label let's test it okay we're getting somewhere we'll need to create a canvas canvas equals canvas we're adding it to our window i'm going to set the background color equal to our background constant i'm going to set our height equal to the game height and the width equal to the game width that we set and we need to pack this canvas dot pack and we should have a game board i'm going to try and center this window when it appears so we can do that using a few lines of code the first thing we'll do is update our window so that it renders and then we need to find some dimensions so let's say the window width equals window dot w info width and window height equals window dot w info height we'll need our screen width equals window dot screen width and screen height equals window dot w info screen height where is it there it is okay then we need to see how much we're going to adjust the position of our window so let's say x equals screen width divided by 2 minus window width divided by two and do the same thing for y except this will be screen height and window height and that will be why okay then we need to set the geometry window dot geometry we're going to use an f string so let's set the window width times window height and then add plus x plus y so when we pass in x and y these cannot be floats they have to be whole integers so let's add a cast around x and y okay now this should be fairly close to the center yeah that's not too bad now when we begin a new game we should create a snake object as well as a food object snake equals snake and called the snake constructor and food equals food okay let's fill in our food class first because i think that'll be easier than our snake class so let's head to the food class now let's create an init method so def init this will construct a food object for us and we need to place our food object randomly so for the x coordinate let's say x equals random dot rand int and we need a range the range is going to be zero comma now with our game board i view it like a chess board there's a given amount of spaces so 700 divided by our space size is 14 possible spots on the x-axis and then 14 possible spots on the y-axis so i need to pick one of these spots randomly so let's say game width divided by our space size so we'll get a random number between 0 and 14 however this should be exclusive so let's say -1 and for good measure i'm just going to add a set of parentheses around this okay and then we'll convert this to pixels so let's multiply all of this by our space size the size of each item in the game and we'll do the same thing for y but change game width to height okay we should be good all right now let's set the coordinates let's say self dot coordinates equals a list of x and y and that's it but make sure you spell coordinates right now we need to draw our food object on our canvas canvas dot create oval you can pick a square two if you like we need a starting corner that will be where x and y is and an ending coordinator so that will be x and y plus our space size the size of an object in that game so x plus space size y plus space size and you can set a fill color too fill will be our food color that we declared and i recommend adding a tag as well that'll make it easy to delete this object so tag will equal the string food now let's just test this so we should have a random circle or a square if you picked a square appear someplace at some spot on my game board cool seems like it's working let's work on the snake class next our snake class we'll need a constructor and we will set a body size equal to our body parts we'll need a list of coordinates fill this in later and a list of square graphics so that will be a list okay so we need to create a list of coordinates we can use a for loop for that so let's say for i in range zero through body parts we will take self dot coordinates and append a new list and the coordinates for each body part at the start of the game will be 0 0 so that our snake will appear in the top left corner now we'll need to create some squares okay so for x y in self dot coordinates and remember that we have a list of lists so that's why we're using x y in self coordinates we'll create a square equals canvas dot create rectangle so we need a starting corner that will be x and y then x plus our space size the size of each object in the game let me use the constant though space size y plus space size and let's set a fill color equal to our snake color all right and let's set a tag for convenience tag equals a string of snake okay so we have a list of squares and we can append each square into our list self dot squares dot append and pass in whatever square that you create so we have a snake that has a body size a list of coordinates and a list of square graphics now after testing this we should have the head of our snake in the top left corner and now we just need the snake to move in a given direction every turn so the initial direction is down but we'll be able to change that later so let's head to the next turn function and there's actually two things we'll need as parameters that i forgot to fill in snake as well as food and we will call this function when we begin our game so let's unpack the head of the snake so that's x comma y equals snake dot coordinates at index of zero so that's the head of the snake the coordinates will be stored in x and y so let's check to see if our direction our initial direction equals up and we'll need some else if statements we'll fill this in just a moment else if our direction equals down then left and then right okay if our direction is up then let's take our y coordinate for the head of our snake minus equals our space size so that we move one space up and then down is plus equals space size left is x minus equals space size and lastly right is x plus equals space size okay then we need to call the next turn function again for the next turn so we can use window dot after we need the time so let's say our game speed we're going to call the next turn function and we need to pass in our arguments of snake and food snake food oh and make sure you're not actually calling the next turn function inside of the after method you just have to write the function name of next turn without the parentheses okay so let's update the coordinates for the height for the snake and write that before we move on to the next turn so snake dot coordinates and we will insert a new set of coordinates after updating one of them so zero will be the index the head of the snake and we will insert x and y coordinates at this new location now we're going to create a new graphic for the head of the snake square equals canvas dot create rectangle pass in x and y for the starting corner of our rectangle and the ending corner will be x plus our space size y plus our space size then i will add a fill color of snake color and then we need to update our snakes list of squares so that will be snake dot squares and insert at index 0 a new square that we create okay let's test this one last thing that we'll need to get this program to run is that after you create your snake and food object we should call it the next turn function and pass in our snake and food object so we should be able to test this so our snake is going to move but we need to delete the last body part in our snake within the next turn function but before we update to the next turn let's delete the last body part of our snake so delete snake dot coordinates at negative index of one that is the last set of coordinates we will update our canvas canvas dot delete snake dot squares an index of negative one and lastly delete snake the list of squares at index of negative one so it should appear that our snake is moving cool we need some controls for our snake so at the bottom of our program let's bind some keys let's do that here so window dot bind let's find the left arrow key and we will use a lambda the argument is event and we will call the change direction function and pass in the word left okay then we have to do the same thing for the other directions so we have right pass in right up pass in up down pass in down let's head to the change direction function we need to access our direction global direction this is the old direction if our new direction that is passed in is equal to left and if our old direction this direction does not equal right because we do not want to go backwards and do a 180 degree turn then we will set our direction equal to our new direction and we just need to repeat this for the other directions for new direction and i'm going to change this to else if else if new direction is right and our direction is not already left then we have up if our direction is not down and down if our direction is not up okay so we should be able to change the direction of our snake sweet okay we need to eat that pesky apple next so let's work on that there's nothing else that we need to change within the change direction function so i'm going to minimize this function and head to the next turn function we'll place an if statement here if x remember that we unpacked the coordinates for the head of the snake if x the x coordinate for the head of the snake is equal to our food objects coordinates at index of zero that's the x-coordinate for our food object and y is equal to food coordinates at index of one that means they're overlapping let's take our score and increment it by one and change our label label.config the text will equal score and then i'm going to use the format method and pass in my new score let's delete our food object and we gave our food object a tag so we can just use the name of the tag to delete it and create a new food object then i'm going to write this part of our program within an else statement we will only delete the last body part of our snake if we did not eat a food object okay let's test it again so i have three body parts now i have four five six seven eight nine ten you can see that the score is going up too okay let's work on collisions next because i should not be able to go off screen like this there's one thing that we're going to change so let's add an if statement that will check collisions this will return true or false if we detect a collision and pass in our snake object if there is a collision we'll call the game over function else we will update to the next turn okay let's fill in the check collisions function and we no longer need our function of next turn actually we don't need these classes either so i'll minimize them okay check collisions so it looks like we will need a parameter of snake so be sure to set that let's unpack the head of the snake x y equals snake dot coordinates at index of zero and let's check to see if we cross the left or right border of the game if x is less than zero or x is greater than or equal to our game width then return true i think for testing purposes i'm going to print something to the console window game over let's test it okay i'm going to go over to the right border game over and our game stopped let's go over the left game over cool so we know that it's working okay let's do the same thing for y we can use else if here if y is less than zero or y is greater than or equal to our game height let's print game over and return true and we should probably test it okay i'm going up game over and let's go down game over so what if our snake touches its tail or another body part so let's say four i actually i isn't too descriptive let's say for every body part in snake dot coordinates we're going to set this to everything after the head of the snake we're going to check to see if any of the coordinates are matching if x is equal to body part at index 0 and y is equal to body part at index 1 then return true and i'll print game over to test it print game over otherwise we can return false there are no collisions i think i'm going to change the size of the snake to 10. okay let's run into each other cool game over and the last thing that we need to do is to fill in the game over function because it looks like everything else is fine so head to the game over function take your canvas and delete all and we'll create some game over text canvas create text i would like this in the center of my canvas i'll take canvas w info width divided by two comma canvas w info height divided by two i'm going to put some of this on the next line for readability i'll set a font pick whatever font that you want we'll need some text text equals game over pick a color red's decent i'll add a tag too for convenience game over and that should be it for the game over function i'm going to change the body parts of the snake back to what it was originally and we should probably test that game over screen all right it appeared okay so let's change some of these settings around you can create a larger game board let's say 1000 by 700 that still works you can slow down the speed or speed it up so 100 will be about half as fast it's going pretty slow now but what if we set it to 20. you can change the space size so everything is a lot smaller now including the food object you can change the body parts what about 20 to begin with that's fairly excessive i'll change that back to three you can change the snake color let's say we would like a blue snake so that is for a hex color four zeros and then two f's you can change the food color so let's say we would like a yellow food object so that would be four f's and then two zeros kind of resembles the python logo that color scheme you can change the background color too so let's say all white that would be six apps i do not like that go back delete delete delete alright well that should be everything let's run this game one last time [Music] [Music] well everybody that is a very basic game of snake for beginners i will post all of this code to the comment section down below but yeah that's a basic game of snake using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] you
YOhrIov7PZA,Python multiprocessing ⚡,2021-02-08T16:23:17Z,yo what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain multi-processing in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show what's up let's talk about multi-processing multi-processing is the act of running tasks in parallel on a different cpu cores it's different from multi-threading although it sounds similar because with multi-threading we're limited to running one thread at a time because of the gi l that lock which is used for threading we can run threads concurrently but not in parallel however with multi-processing we can create processes and we can run each process in parallel on a different cpu course so with multiprocessing it's better for tasks that are cpu bound where you need heavy cpu usage whereas multi-threading that is better for io bound tasks where you do a lot of waiting around so before we begin i recommend these two imports multi-processing and time let's begin quick note if you're running the windows operating system you'll probably need to add this line if name is equal to main so when we run a program we have a main process that is running and if we create a child process from that process it's going to copy the module that we're currently working with and that child process will create its own children processes and it's going to be a problem so we're going to add this line if name is equal to main so when we create a child process it will copy our module but it's not going to execute it so let's create a main function and a majority of our code is going to be within our main function if you're running a different operating system you probably don't have to do this but if you're running windows you probably will now with multi-processing multi-processing is better for tasks or functions that are cpu bound where they require heavy cpu usage let's say that we have a function named counter and we'll pass in a number to count up to but the number we're going to pass in is a ridiculously large number like a billion so let's create a function that will count from zero so count equals zero and while count is less than our number that we pass in we will increment our counter by one so that is the function that we'll call with our processes that we create now within our main function we'll create a process and to do that you'll need the multi-processing module so import process and cpu count and we'll save this for a little bit later to create a process let's say we have process a a equals process this step is very similar to creating a thread we have a target our target will be our function of counter and if we have arguments we will pass those in so remember with our arguments we have to pass in a tuple since we only have one argument to pass in to differentiate this from an expression we have to add a comma at the end so our number let's say is one billion so that's a million ten million one hundred million one billion let me just verify that okay so that's one billion we're going to count from zero to a billion and in order to start this process a my process use the start function and then i will use some process synchronization by using the join function my main process is going to wait around for my child process of a to finish before continuing and let's print our performance counter so we'll print finished in let's say time dot performance counter seconds okay so let's see how long it'll take to count from zero to a billion using one process i fast forwarded this video but it took my program 56.7 seconds to count from zero to a billion but we can speed this up by using multi-processing let's create a second process named b and i'm going to divide the amount of work in half so each process will count to 500 million half of a billion so let's change a to b and i'm going to group these start functions together just so it's easier to read and then b dot join just to synchronize everything okay and then let's change 1 billion to 500 million for each it's the same amount of work but divided among workers so that is 500 million let's see how well it runs this time so it took my program about 40.3 seconds to finish counting from zero to a billion but i divided that task among different processes each of my two processes counted from zero to 500 million this time so this time let's create four processes so we have a b c and d and we'll need to start them and i'm going to join them now this might not actually speed it up for you and i'll explain why later it depends on the amount of cpu cores that you have okay so oh let's change this to so 250 million for each okay see you in a couple seconds okay welcome back so on my computer when i ran four processes and each was counting up to 250 million i could finish my program in 27.3 seconds now for me if i created more processes than this it would probably take longer and here's why so you can print the cpu count of your computer using this function of cpu count so if i were to print whatever this function returns i can get the count of the number of additional processes that i can run for the time being i'm just going to comment out this start function because i just want to print whatever this value is so my cpu count on my computer is four so i can run four additional processes but let's attempt to run eight processes so i'm going to copy all these and let's say that we have e f g and h and we will start all those two so give me a second just to start them so a b c d e f g h and then i'm going to join all of them e f g and h okay so let's run this now oh and change the arguments do i keep forgetting to do that so let's say 125 for each so 125 million times 8 is 1 billion okay see you in a bit all right welcome back this time when i had eight processes working it actually took me longer than when i had four processes working when i had four processes working it took me about 27 seconds this time it took 30 seconds when i had eight processes working that's because i had more processes than my cpu count and that's partially because whenever you create a process there's significant overhead with beginning and destroying a process and if i can only run four processes on my computer at one time well then i'm creating additional processes to no extra benefit it's actually hindering the performance of the computer because i'm creating all of these additional processes when it really doesn't help me in conclusion multiprocessing is the concept of running tasks in parallel on different cpu cores it's similar but different from multi-threading because with multi-threading we can run tasks concurrently but they're all taking turns because of the gil with multi-processing we can run all of these different tasks together in parallel multi-processing is better for cpu bound tasks where a task has heavy cpu usage and multi-threading is better for i o bound tasks tasks that involve a lot of waiting around so that's multi-processing if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this to the comment section down below but yeah that is how multi-processing works in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to

5UQZNHlaUVc,Python calculator app 🖩,2021-02-01T14:03:21Z,what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create a basic calculator using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm let's create a calculator after importing tkinter we'll need to define three separate functions our first function will be named button press and there is one parameter which we will call num we're not going to fill this in quite yet we'll get back to it later we'll use pass as a placeholder we'll also need an equals function to calculate our expression and a function to clear our calculator okay that's it for our three functions let's create a window window equals tk and at the end of our program we'll write window.midloop let's set a title window dot title calculator programs good but make sure you spell title right and let's set a geometry of 500 by 500 should be decent now we're going to create a string named equation text equals a set of quotes this will effectively be empty for the time being and we'll need to create a string var and i will call this equation label equals string var let's create a label label equals label we're adding our label to our window i will set our text variable equal to our equation label you can pick a font if you wish i'll set the background color equal to white a width of 24 and a height of two and we need to finish this by using label dot pack and we should have a blank label within our calculator this will display our numbers that we're entering in or our expression okay this is the tedious part we have to create all of the buttons and i think we should place these all within a frame frame equals frame we're adding our frame to our window frame dot pack now let's create button one we'll do some copying and pasting later so it's not as tedious so button one equals button we're adding our button to our frame i'll set the text equal to one the height equal to four and the width equal to nine and a font size of 35 okay we'll need a command command equals i'll write a lambda function here lambda we will call button press actually i think i'm going to put this on the next line just so it's easier to read button press and we will pass in the number one and we need to add our button to our frame button one dot grid and i'm going to set a row equal to zero and a column equal to zero and let's just test it okay let's add the other buttons i'm going to copy and paste everything that we have for button one and change button one to button two set the text equal to two pass into two button press and for the row and column i'm going to set the column equal to one but keep row the same okay button three it's gonna be the same process really so text equals three button press three row zero column two and button four text equals four button press four column actually let's set this to row one column zero and i need to change that too okay let's just double check this okay button five so button five text equals five button press five and let's set column equal to one okay number six i told you all this is going to be tedious okay so row one column two seven okay so row two column two actually let's change that to column zero much better okay button eight eight eight eight eight row two column one number nine row two column two and lastly zero so button zero text equals zero button press pass in zero and this will be row three column zero okay not too bad now let's fill in some of the symbols so we need plus i'm just going to rename this as plus the text will equal the plus sign put that within quotes and button press will be plus on we should probably put this in a row and column so let's say row zero column three so it should be on the right hand side here okay we need minus let's change plus to minus and place this at row one column three we need multiply that is an asterisk row two column three and divide that is a forward slash row three column three i promise we're near the end of creating these buttons we'll need an equal sign let's say equal equal text is the equal sign and our command is going to be equals the function and this will be row 3 column 2. we need a decimal let's change the text to a decimal row three column one okay and lastly we just need a clear button let's put this at the bottom so clear clear let's set the text equal to the word clear and the command will be our clear function and i think i'm going to pack this at the end but let's change frame to window okay let's check out all these buttons okay not too bad i think i'm going to change the width on our clear button so it's a little bit wider let's change the width to 12. that's a little bit better okay let's fill in some of these functions let's start with button press we're going to state global equation text then our equation text is equal to equation text plus we're converting whatever number or symbol that we receive to a string and our equation label which is a string var will be set to our equation text and let's test this so we can type in any combination of numbers or symbols okay let's work on our equals function next so let's say global equation text total equals eval now eval will parse the expression that we pass in equation text and our equation label will be set to whatever our total is and if we want to reuse our total let's set our equation text equal to total two plus two equals four minus three equals one times five equals five divided by two equals two point five now what if we divide by zero well we'll run into that ugly zero division error so let's write our code within a try and accept block so i'm going to indent some of this and let's write try all of this code and we will catch a zero division error exception so accept zero division error and i will set our equation label set let's say arithmetic error text equals a set of quotes okay so we should be able to catch this exception now five divided by zero equals arithmetic error now what if we have a syntax here like we type in just a bunch of symbols and hit equals we'll probably want to catch the syntax error as well so let's write an additional accept block before zero division error or after i guess it doesn't matter accept syntax error let's change arithmetic to syntax and we can keep equation text the same so now our program won't crash if we type in a bunch of symbols syntax error now let's work on the clear button so that is within the clear function so we will set global equation text equation label dot set to a set of quotes to effectively clear it and our equation text equal to a set of quotes as well and that should be it for this program let's run this one last time let's say three point one four times two point one equals six point five nine four divided by 2.1 equals 3.14 minus 1. i'm just making up numbers here plus 10 equals 12.14 and let's clear this and start again one plus two plus three plus 4 equals 10. i think that's good enough all right everybody so that's how to create a basic calculator in python i will post all of my code in the comments section down below if you would like a copy for yourself but yeah that's how to create a basic calculator using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like

3p3gF8b4cN0,Python method chaining ⛓️,2021-01-25T19:02:02Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about method chaining in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody let's talk about method training method chaining is used to call multiple methods sequentially and each call performs an action on the same object and return self here's an example of how method chaining would be useful let's say we have a class named car car has four methods turn on drive break and turn off they will all just print a simple message beginning with turn on turn on will print you start the engine drive will print you drive the car brake will print you step on the brakes and turn off will print you turn off the engine let's say we have a car object car equals car and i would like my car object to use its turn on method immediately followed by the drive method with how we've been coding things previously we may write something such as the name of the object in this case car dot and then the method to use i would like my card to use the turn on method followed by car dot drive so currently this will take two lines of code but this will print you start the engine and you drive the car now with method training we can call multiple methods sequentially now the format on this is going to be a little bit different and if we were to write the same code using method chaining it might look a little something like this after the first method call we would add dot and then an additional method that we would like to call so for example after the turn on method we'll immediately call the drive method but there's one more thing that we need to add when we're using python to do method training so normally this by itself will not work when we call a method in python if there is nothing that is returned python will return none so as you can see here attribute error none type object has no attribute of drive so we need to return itself under each method that we're using method training with so let's add return self to each of these methods so let's do that for drive break and the turn off method and this should work now you start the engine you drive the car so think of it like this after we finish calling this method python is going to return self so it's going to return car so then we'll immediately use car.drive now here's another example let's say i would like to call the break method followed by the turn off method so that would be car dot break parenthesis followed by dot turn off so this will print you step on the brakes you turn off the engine now here's an extreme example let's say we would like to call all four methods in order so that would be car dot turn on followed by dot drive dot break dot turn off so this will call all four methods in order starting with the leftmost method you start the engine you drive the car you step on the brakes you turn off the engine now if you have one long method chain like this it might become difficult to read after a while so what i would recommend if you're doing a lot of method chaining is that after each method call just hit enter to move each method call down to a new line so it'll look something like that and this backslash might be inserted this is a line continuation character so this is a little more readable but you know it still does the same thing basically all right everybody so that is method training it's used to call multiple methods sequentially and each call performs an action on the same object and returns self if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to do a method chaining in python

2KzyvzeWFbQ,Python walrus operator := 🦦,2021-01-04T14:01:08Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to discuss the walrus operator in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm alright people i hope you like walruses because that's the topic of this video we'll be discussing the walrus operator also known as an assignment expression it's a colon followed by an equal sign and it kind of looks like a walrus on its side now this is a new feature for python 3.8 what it does is that it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression here's an example of why the walrus operator would be useful let's say we have a variable named happy happy equals true if you're not happy or you're feeling so so you can set this to false if you want so let's print the value contained within happy so this will print true to the console window now wouldn't it be cool if we could combine both of these statements together so we would want to say something such as happy equals true and then print it to the console window using one line of code well normally we can't do this using the standard assignment operator now one thing that we can do is use the walrus operator this assigns a value to a variable as part of a larger expression so this would technically be allowed if this assignment operator was instead an assignment expression the walrus operator happy walrus true and when they're all within a print statement we can assign a value to a variable and use it as a part of a larger expression so as you can see this new variable of happy was assigned and used in one expression now here's a more practical example of why the walrus operator would be useful let's say we have the small program what this will do is consistently ask you what food you like and put it into a list called foods foods equals list while true food equals input what food do you like if food equals quit break then append our list of foods with this new food item that we have okay let's run this then so this while loop will continue as long as i don't type in quit and it will consistently ask me what food do i like and place that food item into a list named foods so let's begin what food do i like well i do like pizza i like sushi and i like ice cream and that should be enough for me i'm going to type in quit to exit this program now let's write the same program but instead use a walrus operator so that we can write this program using less lines of code now if i were to use the walrus operator this is how i would write the same program we would still need our list foods equals list now for my while loop it's going to look something like this while food walrus operator input what food do you like all right this is the assignment portion now we can use this assignment portion within a larger expression so let's also check to see if our input does not equal quit all right so then after each iteration of this while loop we will take our list foods dot append food and that is it so we have written the same program in about half the lines of code that we did previously so let's test it what food do you like pizza sushi ice cream and quit well everybody that is the basics of the walrus operator also known as an assignment expression it's a new feature for python 3.8 and beyond so if this doesn't work for you i would check to see what version of python you're using first it assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how the walrus operator works in python
o-lAsVuskKI,JavaFX CSS styling 🎨,2021-01-04T14:01:12Z,hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in today's video i'm gonna demonstrate how we can apply a css file to a javafx gui application so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right let's get this show on the road i'm going to demonstrate how we can apply a css style sheet to our javafx gui applications if you don't know any css that's completely fine we'll cover some of the basics but after watching this video and you want to learn more about css check out my full course on html and css do it now if you're using eclipse then eclipse might have generated a css style sheet for you already let's say that we don't have this let's start fresh so i'm going to delete this bye and this is how to create a new css file right click on your package within your project folder go to new other file under the general folder next i will name this application but name it whatever you want dot css and finish our next step is to apply our style sheet to a scene so you'll need this line of code in scene if that's what you named your scene get stylesheet dot add get class get resource the name of your css file mine is application.com whatever you named this to external form and that should link your css style sheet to your scene although if you need to apply a css style sheet to more than one scene i actually recommend breaking this line of code into two so that we can reuse our style sheet so if that is the case and you have more than one scene i recommend writing something like this let's create a string variable named css that will contain the location of our css file that we have so string css equals this dot and copy everything within the add method from the previous line get class get resource the name of your css style sheet to external form and now we can take our scene dot get style sheets dot add css and that's it since we're storing our resource within a string variable named css we can just keep on reusing the string and if we have multiple scenes we can just type in the next scene for example like scene one or scene two get style sheets add css and then we can just keep on repeating this for each scene that we have so that's another way in which you could write this now that we've linked our style sheet we'll need an application to work with so i'm going to go to my fxml file and open with scene builder so that we can build something for practice and then style it now within scene builder we're not going to build anything too fancy just something very basic so i'm going to use an anchor pane for this example and i'm going to add two labels you can find labels under your control so where is it there it is let's create two labels perhaps one right here and another maybe right here that should be good now you can change the text on these two let's say level one for the first label and the second label perhaps this is some css styling all right one thing that we'll probably want to do for this video is to give each of these labels a unique id although it's not required so under code i'm going to give this first label a unique id i'll call this maybe title label and for the next id i will call this perhaps text label name it something memorable and that should be good for now i'm going to save this file save now that we're out of scene builder let's do one final check before running this head to your fxml file and make sure that everything is populated within here and within your start method make sure you have the following lines of code we're creating a root node we're creating a scene adding the root node to our scene we're applying our css style sheet we're setting the stage with the scene and stage.show at the end so now currently our application looks a little something like this and now we can use some css styling to style our labels and the background too so let's head to our css file alright here's a crash course on css in like under a minute using css we can style specific items by their id or entire classes by using their class name to target an item by its id you would type hashtag and then the name of the id of that specific item so if i would like to style the title label that i would have i would type hashtag then the name of the id and for this example it is title label and now for all of the properties that we will apply to this item we will put within a body a set of curly braces now that's how to target a specific item by its id you can also select an entire class of items by typing dot and then the class name that will apply css styling to an entire class of items let's say now that i would like to style all labels so we would type dot and then the name of the class and in this case it is label however this is lowercase though so dot label will apply css styling to an entire class of items and for example let's say that i would like to change the root node that would be dot root and then a class body all right let's apply some css styling these are in property value pairs however with fx we would precede all of the css properties with dash fx dash and then the name of the property so let's say we would like to change the background color that would be background dash color colon and then some value let's say i would like to change the color to black and then add a semicolon to the end so now when i run this all root nodes will have the background color of black just like this alternatively you could use hexadecimal values in place of color names so black for example would be hashtag zero zero zero zero zero zero however i think i'm going to change this to a slightly lighter shade of black so perhaps six ones that should be good and this should be a lighter shade of black so you can always look up a hexadecimal color picker if you like a custom color i believe rgb values would work as well okay let's change the font of the labels so that would be fx dash the name of the css property let's say font dash size colon and perhaps i will set this to 20 and now all labels that we have meaning both of these will have a font size of 20 not just one label but all labels because we're targeting an entire class of labels okay let's change a few other things let's say the font family so that would be fx dash font dash family and at this font i kind of like lucida console kind of looks something like that but let's change the font color that would be text fill and let's select maybe white all right not too bad i think i'm going to increase the size of this level 1 label here and i think we named this title label so if you apply any styling to an entire class you can also apply some additional styling by its id as well so not only will our title label have all of these css properties but we can add some additional ones or change some values so for the font size let's change this to 60 so now only the title label will be larger compared to all labels all right and the last thing that i want to show you guys is how we can center all of this because right now it's kind of off center now there is a css property for that it's going to center all text within its container so that would be fx dash alignment center however this by itself will not change it and i'll show you why basically speaking this alignment property will center any text within its container however this container is the minimum size it needs to be to accommodate the size of the text what we're going to do is expand this container so that the width equals the width of the frame that we have so let's head back into scene builder and expand the size of our containers now here i am within scene builder now select one of your labels and you'll notice a slightly shaded portion that is the size of the container of this label basically when we're using the alignment property we're centering this text within the small container so why don't we expand the size of the container so that it's the same width as the size of the pane that we're working with and if you see that it's left aligned that's completely fine when we run this it's going to be centered so let's expand both of these containers so that they take up the entire width of our pane that we're working with let's save and then head back to our program now you may need to open the tab for your fxml file just to be sure that everything updates and then we can run this program and everything should be center yep just like that well ladies and gentlemen that is how to apply a css stylesheet to your javafx gui applications like i said at the beginning of this video if you're interested in learning more about css i do have a free full course on both html and css on the channel and well yeah that's how to apply css to javafx hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] you
N3LZM4WFHBY,JavaFX Event Handling using Scene Builder 🎪,2020-12-28T21:27:32Z,hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use scene builder to handle events so sit back relax and enjoy the show if i could have just a moment of your time please like comment and subscribe i would greatly appreciate it all right people let's get this show on the road now for this video we'll need an fxml file if you do not have that this is how to create that i'm going to go to my application package right click go to new other new fxml next i will name this main and click finish and you should have this line of code within your start method parent root equals fxml loader blah blah blah blah blah but the important thing is to get resource and this should contain the name of your fxml file now for each event that we have we will have a corresponding method but i like to keep all of my event methods in one place so i'm going to be creating a separate java file to contain those so to do that right click on your package go to new then class and i will name this controller because it's going to control all of our events if you have your root node set to your fxml file you have your fxml file created as well as a separate java file with a class listed as controller then we're ready to begin so let's go to our fxml file and open with scene builder here we are within scene builder i'm going to start fresh i will delete this anchor pin and create a new one and then what i'm thinking that will do is that we will have four buttons one for up right down and left and when you click on one of these buttons it's going to move a shape across your screen here so let's create a bunch of buttons that is under controls so i'm just going to drag and drop some buttons we'll have one for up right down and left and if you prefer you can change the text on your buttons by clicking on a button then go to properties on the right hand menu look for text and you can change the text i will change this to up and i'm just going to re-center that this will be right we have down and left now what we got to do is create a method for each button so let's create our first method which will be called up public void up there is one parameter action event e and we'll probably need an import as well make sure you're importing from javafx and not awt and when we click on this button let's test this let's just print something to the console window such as up all right then let's repeat the process for down left and right so i'm just going to copy and paste this up method three additional times and let's change up to down for this next method then we got to do the same for left and right now that we have our four methods what i'm going to do is run and compile this just so that everything is saved and up-to-date now what i need to do next is associate each of these methods with a corresponding button up for up down for down and just follow that pattern but we need to add our controller class to scene builder so i'm going to open with scene builder again on my fxml file and to add your controller navigate to the left hand menu there should be a drop down for your controller under controller class select your controller class and in this case for me this is application.controller and now for each of these buttons let's begin by clicking this up button we can add a method under this on action section on the right hand menu so on action there should be a drop down i will select the corresponding method i would like to link to this button so i will select up for up right for right down for down and left for left for the time being let's save minimize scene builder and let's head to our fxml file underneath each of these buttons there should be a section related to on action and if these are all here then we should be good so let's run this now when i click up this will display up down left and right okay we know that the buttons are working now let's take this a step further let's add a circle to our scene and move the circle around by using our buttons so let's head back to scene builder to add a circle to our scene go to the left hand menu under the shapes drop down select circle and drag and drop it to your scene let's save this and head back to our controller class within your controller class at the top add this annotation at fxml and you'll likely need an import as well now what this annotation will do is that by use of the fxml loader the fxml loader will inject all of the values found within your fxml file meaning all of this into your controller class for you all you have to do is add this annotation at fxml and now let's declare a few things we'll need a circle so let's declare a circle private circle my circle and we'll need to import this from javafx and let's declare some coordinates private double x and private double y so we technically don't need these print line statements anymore we were just testing something i'm going to turn them into comments but you can feel free to keep them in if you want now let's set up our up method to move our circle up type my circle dot set center y and the value that we're going to pass into the set center y method is y equals y minus one or you could do the shortcut which is y minus equals one now to move our circle down that will be my circle dot set center y y plus equals one and let's do the same thing for left but we change y to x x minus equals one and lastly right that's going to be x plus equals one all right now let's head back to scene builder there's one last thing that we need to do within scene builder select your circle navigate to the right hand menu there should be a drop down for a code section under fx id we're going to type in the name of that circle that we declared my circle let's save this file save we can close out of scene builder and then head to your fxml file let's just be sure that our circle object has that id of my circle so it looks like everything should check out so let's run and compile this and then when we click on our buttons this will move our circle however i think we should move this a few more pixels so let's change one to maybe 10 just so that the change is more noticeable alright so when we click up our circle moves up it moves right down and left well everyone that's the basics of handling events using scene builder if for some reason some of this doesn't work you may have to either restart scene builder or run and compile your code just so that everything is up to date because things don't like to refresh i noticed so if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to handle events using scene builder in javafx hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down

q2SGW2VgwAM,Python Object Oriented Programming in 10 minutes 🐍,2020-12-28T21:27:28Z,hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain object oriented programming in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if i could have just a moment of your time please like comment and subscribe i would greatly appreciate it welcome to today's topic on python object-oriented programming also known as p-o-o-p and in today's video we're going to be creating objects an object is an instance of a class by using programming we can create representations of real-life objects so look around you wherever you're sitting or standing right now you are surrounded by objects next to me i have a phone a television some snacks and i'm talking into a microphone point being we can use programming to mimic real world objects by assigning a combination of attributes what an object is or has and methods what an object can do now in order to create an object we'll need to create a class a class can function as a blueprint that will describe what attributes and methods that our distinct type of object will have you can either create your class within your main module or you could create a separate file dedicated solely for your class now to create a class we would type class and then the name of the object that we would like to create so today i would like to create some car objects because i like cars so we would type car and a common naming convention with class names is that they should be capital so car is going to have a capital c and for the time being we need to type in something i'll just type in pass as a placeholder so if you have a small program it may be better to write your class within your main module but if your class is fairly large you may want to consider placing your class within a separate module so if you were to take that route we would go to file new python file and we would name this car click python file and we would declare our class within the separate module so class car and for now i'll type in pass then we just need to import this class so within our main module we would type from the name of the module import the name of the class from car import car now objects can have some combination of attributes and methods attributes describe what an object is or has so what are a few attributes that cars might have they might have a make so let's create a few variables for the time being i'm just going to use none as a placeholder cars can have a model a year and a color now objects can also have methods what kinds of methods could cars perform perhaps a drive method and a stop method so let's define those def let's say drive and we'll have one argument self self refers to the object that is using this method now what do we want to do when we call this method let's say this car is driving let's create a stop method as well tef stop and we will print this car is stopped we now have all of the different attributes and methods we would like our car objects to have but there is one more thing that we need it is a special method called the init method that will construct objects for us in other programming languages this is known as the constructor so we need a special method that will create objects for us so we need to define this method def and the syntax on this is somewhat strange it is two underscores i n i t it's short for initialize 200 scores again and then we need at least self as an argument and then we can actually assign our car objects unique variables so take all of these attributes that we have and we're going to place them within this init method now we can receive arguments when we create car objects but we need to pass them in as arguments to our init method so we need to set up some parameters let's say in order to create a car object we need a make a model a year and a color then when we receive these arguments we can actually assign them to each car's specific attributes but we need to precede each of these with self self is referring to the object that we're currently working on or creating so self.make self.model self.ear and self.color and then when we assign these we're going to say self.make equals whatever make that we receive when it's passed in as an argument self.model equals model and continue that pattern for year and color all right that is all we need for our class car we have a constructor we're assigning arguments that we receive to the attributes of our car object and we also have two methods one for drive and one for stop now we can start creating some car objects so going back to my main file here to create an object we need a unique name for it let's call this first car just car one equals the name of the class car then a set of parentheses now in order to construct a car object we need to pass in a matching set of arguments you can see here that we need to pass in a make a model a year and a color so what kind of car should we make let's say that the make is going to be chevy we need a model perhaps corvette a year 2021 is good and a color let's say blue all right now let's actually access some of these cars attributes and i should probably put this one in a print statement so print car ones make and this should print chevy then we can do the same thing for model year and color so let's change some of these around model year and color yep this object is a chevy corvette 2021 and the color is blue and we should have two methods as well so car one i would like this car to use its drive method this car is driving and let's have this car use its stop method car one dot stop this car is stopped there's one thing that i should mention real quick because i forgot to mention it earlier so within our init method you can see that we need five arguments in order to construct a car object self make model year in color but when we pass in our arguments we're not passing in anything for self we only have four arguments here that's because with python we do not need to pass itself that's done automatically for us we're referring to the object that we're dealing with as you can see with our drive and stop method we need to pass in self in order to execute our method but when we call this method we do not need to do so so just remember with python with self we do not need to pass in anything for this argument that is all now the nice thing about this is that we can reuse this class as a blueprint to create more car objects we just call that init method that constructor so this time let's create a second car called car 2 and this will be a different kind of car what kinds of arguments should we pass it let's say this is a ford mustang the year will be 2022 and the color will be red all right let's check car to use attributes and let's have car 2 use its drive and stop method this is a forward mustang the year is 2022. the color is red this car is driving and this car is stopped one other thing that we can do too is that within our methods here let's replace car with the name of the model that we're working with so this plus self dot model plus is driving now this self keyword think of it as you're replacing self with the name of the object that we're working on if car one is using its drive method replace itself with car one if this is car two that called this method then replace itself with car 2. think of it that way and let's do the same thing for stop this plus self dot model plus is stopped all right probably don't need these anymore so let's have car one use its drive and stop method this corvette is driving this corvette is stopped let's try this with car two this mustang is driving this mustang is stopped now you can have them do things independently too let's have car 1 use its drive method and car 2 use the stop method this corvette is driving and this mustang has stopped in conclusion a class can function as a blueprint to create objects we can assign attributes what describe an object is or has and methods what each object can do and then within our class we have a special method called the init method we can pass in some arguments and assign these arguments to each object's attributes and then we can reuse this class as if it was a blueprint so we can create more objects out of it so that is the basics of object-oriented programming in python if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comment section down below but yeah that's the basics of object oriented programming in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music]

an59YHkdK9A,Python inheritance 👪,2020-12-28T21:27:25Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain inheritance in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running let's talk about inheritance the term inherit means to receive derive or be left with and we can apply this concept to programming classes can inherit something usually attributes and methods from another class these classes can form parent-child relationships where a child will receive everything that the parent class has much like you inherit jeans from your parents and classes can have children and give whatever they own to their children and in today's video we'll be creating a parent class called animal and children of the animal class will inherit the common attributes and methods that all animals might have to kick off this video i think what we'll do is keep all of our classes within the same file just so that it's easier for us to read and understand let's begin by creating a class called animal so at the top type class animal and what are some attributes and methods that all animals should have let's say we have a class variable called alive and we'll set this to true if you're an animal you begin by being alive and what are some methods how about an eat and sleep method so let's define those def eat what are we going to do when we call this method let's print something let's print this animal is eating let's also create a sleep method def sleep what are we gonna do when we call this method let's print something as well this animal is sleeping and we now have our animal class now let's create separate classes for specific types of animals let's say a class for rabbit a fish and a hawk so we can make objects of those classes so let's begin with a rabbit class class rabbit now to use inheritance with the class that you intend to be the child class after the class name add a set of parentheses and then pass in the name of the parent class in this case it's going to be animal so we will add that to the parentheses so now rabbit is the child class and animal is the parent class so the child class is going to inherit everything that the animal class has so for the time being i'm going to type pass so this rabbit class will have access to a class variable called alive and an eat and sleep method so let's define a fish and hawk class and i'm just going to copy what i have here and just change rabbit to fish and then do so again and change rabbit to hawk this is our family tree animal is the parent class and it has three children a rabbit class a fish class and a hot class and for the time being we're just going to write pass as a placeholder so i bet we can create objects from these classes so let's do so let's say we have an object called rabbit rabbit equals rabbit let's do the same thing for fish and hawk all right we now have three objects rabbit fish and hawk and let's take a look at their class variables i bet they have in a live variable let's check that so i would like to print rabbit dot oh would you look at that this rabbit class has a class variable called alive even though there's nothing within this class well that's because we used inheritance so each of these three children classes inherit everything from their parents all of these attributes and methods i bet they have eaten sleep functions as well so let's check that with fish let's have fish use its eat method and hawk will use its sleep method hawk.sleep so the rabbit is alive the fish is eating and the hawk is sleeping now even though we have nothing written within each of these specific types of animal classes all of these animals have access to these attributes and methods because of inheritance and another benefit of inheritance is that we don't need to keep on copying and pasting this code for example let's say we were not using inheritance so we would not need an animal class we could write our code this way where we would just copy and paste everything underneath each of our classes so what if we need to make a change to one of these methods as in your boss says you know what let's change sleep to slumber okay well we would have to go to each of these classes and make the change manually it's not too bad if you have like three classes but what if you have hundreds that's going to take a lot of effort so wouldn't it be nice if we just list everything that each of these classes has in common and then have all of these classes inherit from one common class and then if you need to make any changes you can do so just within this class and this change will apply to all of the different child classes so that's another benefit of inheritance and not only does it make any changes easier but each class can have their own unique attributes and methods as well along with the attributes and methods that they inherit from their parents so for rabbit fish and hawk let's have each of these classes have their own unique method as well so for rabbit let's define a run method if you're a rabbit then you can run so let's print this rabbit is running and i'm just going to fix some of the spacing here all right if you're a fish then you can swim def swim let's print this fish is swimming and lastly we have hawk if you're a hawk then you can fly def fly let's print this hawk is flying like i said before not only do these specific types of animals have access to all of the attributes and methods that they inherit from their parents but they can have their own attributes and methods as well so let's test some of these methods so we have our rabbit fish and hawk objects let's have rabbit use its run method fish we'll use its swim method and hawk will use its fly method and here we go this rabbit is running this fish is swimming and this hawk is flying so in conclusion classes can have children the children classes will inherit everything that their parent class has all of the parents attributes and methods but not only that the children classes can implement their own unique attributes and methods as well so that is inheritance if you would like a copy of this code i will post all of this in the comment section down below but yeah that's the basics of inheritance using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and

hyydAO2qSXQ,Python delete a file 🗑️,2020-12-21T14:04:58Z,hey what's going on everybody it's bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can delete files using python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everybody so in this video we're going to be deleting files using python and in order to do so i recommend importing the os module this is already included with the standard python library all you need to do is import it and now we need a file to work with so let's right click on our projects folder and go to new file i will name this test.txt and we now have a file that we can work with but you know what i would like to delete this file because it's lame so let's do that in order to delete this file let's type os dot remove and we're going to list the file path here since this file is within my project folder i only need to list the file path test.txt if this was someplace else on my computer i would probably need the file path like that but since this file is within my project folder i only need the file name another thing that you can do too at least what i like to do is that i like to pass in a variable called path i will make this a variable and assign it a string value of whatever the path to my file is so i will assign path the name to my file test.txt now when i run this this will delete my file test.txt and you can see that it's no longer there now what if we attempt to delete a file that doesn't exist well we'll encounter an exception so if you want this is optional we can do some exception handling so let's write the remove function within a try block and we will catch this exception file not found error and let's print something print that file was not found now if you attempt to delete a file that doesn't exist your program will not be interrupted and instead you'll print something that file was not found now this function does not remove empty folders this is how to do so and actually let's test that so let's create a new directory i'll call this empty underscore folder now i will attempt to delete this empty folder empty folder we encountered a permission error access is denied so let's create an accept clock for that accept permission error print i don't know you do not have permission to delete that all right to delete an empty folder there is a different function os dot rmdir short for remove directory we're going to list the file path and pass that in as an argument and let's create an else block as well because we can else if there are no exceptions let's print path plus was deleted all right so rmdir remove directory will delete an empty directory empty folder was deleted now this function will not delete a folder that contains files and let's try that so let's create a new directory i'll just call this folder and within this folder i will create a new file test.txt all right let's attempt to delete this folder i will probably need to change the file name let's change that to folder and we encountered an os error that directory is not empty so let's handle this exception we don't need to but i like to accept os air print you cannot delete that using that function okay to delete a folder that contains files we'll need the shuttle module import shuttle and the function that we're looking for is shuttle dot rm tree short for remove tree and we will pass in our path now be careful with this function it is considered dangerous because it will delete a directory and all files contained within so now we can delete a folder that contains files folder was deleted in conclusion these are three basic functions to delete a file or directory they are remove which deletes a file rmdir which is an abbreviation for remove directory which will delete an empty directory and lastly rmtree which is an abbreviation for remove tree and this is of the shuttle module and this will delete a directory containing files so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post this in the comments section down below but yeah that is how to delete files and or directories using python
vg7Hwd9TANY,Python functions 📞,2020-11-30T18:28:56Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain how functions work in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay let's do this thing a function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called this process is also known as invoking a function with programming we try not to repeat code if we don't have to that's why functions are useful because our function can perform some specific task for us some block of code for us whenever it is called so we only need to write that block of code once and if we need to repeat it we just call this function one more time so let's define and create a function we'll create a function called hello and in order to define a function we'll type def and then a unique function name so let's call this function hello and with functions they always end with a set of parentheses and lastly to finish defining this function we'll add a colon at the end so if you go down to the next line take notice that my cursor is now indented any code underneath a function that is indented belongs to that specific function and will only execute whenever that function is called so for now we need to type in something if you don't know what you want your function to do you can always type pass for now but let's print something print the word hello and in order to call this function all we need to do within our program is type the name of the function which is hello and then add a set of parentheses because functions always end with a set of parentheses so what this will do is execute my function once and perform this block of code whenever it is called if i were to remove this well our program currently isn't going to do anything because functions only execute their block of code only when it is called so this time let's print the word hello three times so i will call this function three separate times hello hello hello so when i run this our hello function will be called three separate times now with functions they are not limited to just one line this is an entire block of code so maybe we can do something else too let's print have a nice day now if i were to run this my hello function is going to execute this entire block of code three separate times hello have a nice day now an important feature of functions is that we can send our function some information and our function can do something with that information that it receives let's say this time i would like to print hello plus somebody's name currently name is an unresolved reference what we can do when we call this function is send our function some information this can be a value a variable a collection all sorts of different things so if you need to send your function some information within the parentheses when you call that function just list the data that you want to send your function so let's say i would like to send my function a string value of bro whatever your first name is when you send information to a function these are called arguments they are the information that you're sending to a function and when you define that function you need a matching set of what is known as parameters so our hello function is going to receive one argument a string value we need a matching number of parameters currently this isn't going to work you can see here that hello takes zero positional arguments but one was given our function needs a matching number of parameters so think of it this way when we receive this value we're going to give a nickname to this value so when we receive the string value what do we want to call it well let's call it name so in order to add parameters to your function just list the parameters within the parentheses of that function and well this should work now we have a matching set of arguments and parameters when we call the hello function this time we are sending one argument over and when our hello function receives this argument we're going to give it a temporary nickname of name or you can call this whatever you want to and then we can use this value for whatever we want within our function now if we were to run this this will print hello bro have a nice day now i can send maybe a different value let's say hello and then i will send a string value of dude hello dude have a nice day so this isn't limited to just values we can send variables to let's say we have a variable called name equals bro and this time i'm going to send this variable over hello and then send name so these don't need to be the exact same let's say this is my name and i'm going to send my name over and i will temporarily give this value a nickname of just name and then i can use this variable for something hello bro have a nice day now with arguments you can send more than one value over let's say this time i would like to send two values over so let's send pro maybe for a first name and code for a second name but you can use your first name and last name so this isn't going to work because we do not have a matching set of arguments and parameters we're sending two arguments over but our function is only designed to accept one argument because we have one parameter so let's rename name as first name and we need two parameters this time so what are we going to call this value when we receive it let's call this last name so this time we are going to receive two values they will be nicknamed first name and last name so this time let's print hello first name maybe i'll add a space plus last name and this is now valid hello bro code have a nice day with arguments you can mix and match the data types that you're sending as arguments so currently we're sending two string values as arguments this time let's send an integer value let's say we would like to send an edge over to our hello function so i'll just send maybe the value of 21 so currently this isn't going to work because the hello function takes two positional arguments but three were given when we call this hello function we're sending this argument over but our function doesn't know what to do with this argument so we need a matching parameter for this value that it receives so let's call this value maybe edge as a temporary nickname and then we can do something with this value when we receive it so let's print an additional message perhaps u r plus age plus years old so if you need to display an integer or number along with the string you do need to convert it to a string so let's just cast our edge as a string when we display this so this should work now we now have a matching number of arguments and parameters so this will display hello bro code you are 21 years old have a nice day so ladies and gentlemen in conclusion a function is a block of code which is executed only when it is called if i were to remove this function call well then our program is just going to completely ignore this function and this block of code would not be executed when we call this function we can pass information known as arguments but we need a matching number of parameters set up to receive these arguments there are a few advanced features of parameters but i'll hopefully get to that in future videos we'll just stick with the basics for now of functions so that's the basics of functions if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below but yeah that is how functions work in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learned something new then help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that

t35B5HjPm9Q,Python string format 💬,2020-11-30T18:29:35Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about the format method in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay ladies and gentlemen let's begin the format method is a method available to strings it's optional and it gives users more control when displaying output to best demonstrate this i'm going to use a line from a popular nursery rhyme titled hey diddle diddle because well you know i'm a mature adult like that i'll be printing this line to my console window the cow jumped over the moon let's do so using a standard print statement and then i'll show you the benefits of using the format method later for this example i have two variables a variable called animal and i'm going to store a string of cow and item and i'll be storing an item name which is moon when we compile and run this as you would expect the output is the cow jumped over the moon there's a more elegant way of writing this line of code and that is by using the format method available to strings i'm going to turn this line into a comment and we're instead going to produce the same output but use the format method instead so we need a standard print statement like usual and then a string that we would like to format so we're going to write the same thing but in place of the variables we're going to add a placeholder the instead of the variable name or value name i'm going to add a set of curly braces so that functions as a placeholder for a value or a variable the this should be cow jumped over the and i'm going to insert another placeholder now this is a string we can format the string by following this string with dot format parentheses and within the parentheses of the format method we can insert some values or variables let's begin with some values i would like to insert cow as well as moon so this will produce the same output but it's written a little more elegantly we can also replace these with variables because they store these values so i'm going to replace cow with animal and moon with item and this will create the same output as it did before these curly braces are what's known as format fields they function as a placeholder for a value or a variable and they work in order the first format field will insert the first value at this location if you have another set or more sets of this format field you'll insert the next value that's listed within the format method so if we were to switch these around we'll switch the position of animal with item well then the first format field is going to insert our item and the second format field will insert our animal this time the moon jumped over the cow an additional way of inserting values at a given placeholder would be to use what's referred to as a positional argument within these format fields we will list the index of the value that we would like to insert at this location if you need to insert the first value well that has an index of 0 because computers always start with zero and following that pattern the next index would be one if you had let's say three values that you need to insert if you had another placeholder that would be two then so you would just follow that pattern so there's going to be no visible change but what we could do is reverse the positional arguments of these placeholders so what do you think would happen if i switched one with zero at these locations well this format field is going to insert the value found at index one this first value is index zero and the second one is index one so now the rolls are reversed this time the moon jumped over the cow our last way of inserting some values at a given format field would be to use what's referred to as a keyword argument within the format method we're going to list some keyword argument pairs we need a keyword name followed by a value so let's say animal is going to be the keyword we're going to say equals some value animal equals cow and item equals moon and you may have noticed that the color of your text might have changed so we no longer need these variables actually but i'm going to comment out these two print statements because we will get an error then so these are in keyword argument pairs and within our format field instead of keeping these empty or using an index we can use the keyword name at my first format field i'm going to insert my keyword of animal and at my second format field i would like to insert the item keyword so the result is going to be the cow jumped over the moon so let's reverse these now we'll place our item keyword here and then at the second format field we will insert our animal and this time the moon jumped over the cow here's an important concept that i'd like to bring to your attention with these values found within the format method you can actually reuse some of these more than once so let's say we would like to state the animal jumped over the animal we're going to use this animal keyword twice and our output is going to be the cow jumped over the cow if we're doing the same thing with positional arguments we can reuse the same index this time let's say that the moon jumped over the moon so our item has an index of one so within our first format field we'll state the index will be one and our second format field will also be one so our output's going to be the moon jumped over the moon all right let's take things up a level there's an even more elegant way in which we could write all of this what we'll do is store our string that we would like to format within a variable let's turn this line into a comment and let's create a variable called text text equals the string that we would like to format which is the format field jumped over the format field and if we need to format this variable we can just call the format method on it so within a print statement let's say text dot and then use the format method and pass in the values that we would like to insert at these placeholders so we're going to insert animal as well as item so our result as you would imagine is the cow jumped over the moon this next section i'm going to explain how we can add some padding to a string when we display it using the format method let's say we have a name variable and assign this a value of whatever your name is so i would like to display my name along with the custom message let's say hello my name is and then i'll use a format field here so let's follow this string by using the format method and i would like to insert my name at this location so currently this will display hello my name is bro or whatever else your name is so we can add some padding either before our name after or we can add some padding to the left and the right hand side of our value that we have so what we'll do to begin is let's add some padding to the right hand side of our name that we have so within our format field if we need to add some padding within the format field add colon and then the amount of space you would like to allocate to displaying your value so let's say 10. so i'm going to allocate 10 spaces worth of room to display my name you can't really see it right now but let's take a look so i can't move my cursor past this line at the end of my name but with my second line i have all of this room to work with so if i were to change my string that i have let's say nice to meet you well then all of this padding that i have is going to be more evident so we can add a number preceding with a colon to add some padding to a value and then you can left align this right align it or center align it so what i'll do is copy this line that i have if you need to left align it you use the less than sign but there's going to be no visible change because that's already the default if you need to write a line precede your number with a greater than sign so your value is going to be right aligned if you need to center this value then use the carrot so this will center align your value within the padding that you have allotted one question that you might have for me and i'll try and answer that now because it's relevant what if we need to add a positional argument or a keyword argument to our format field if there's already some text within here so what you would do before the colon you would just precede the colon with either your positional argument or your keyword argument followed by colon and then whatever you want to add afterwards to format your value that you have all right ladies and gentlemen we are near the end and i promise that this is the last section how can we format some numbers let's say we have a number variable and this will equal the first few digits of pi 3.14159 let's pretend that we would like to display only the first two digits after the decimal so we can do so using the format method let's print the number pi is and then i'll use a format field here and we will call the format method and insert our number that we have so if i need to display only the first two digits after the decimal within the format field i will add colon dot to f is for floating point numbers that's anything with a decimal portion so the result is that this will display only the first two digits after my decimal because we placed two within the format field so if this was 3 0.3 f this would display three digits after the decimal portion oh and apparently this will round your number so that's something that you should keep in mind so this time let's change our number to something larger like 1000 and i will copy this line and make a few changes let's say the number is and i would like to add a comma at the thousands place so after the colon within the format field i will add a comma so this will automatically add a comma to all 1000s places another cool thing that you can do is that you can display your number as binary so within the format field add colon b this will display a binary representation of your number you can do the same thing with octal by adding colon o so our number is now being displayed as an octal number and you can do the same thing with hexadecimal lowercase x for lowercase or uppercase x for all uppercase so my number 1000 is now in hexadecimal and lastly we can display this number in scientific notation using either lowercase e for lowercase or capital e for uppercase and mynumber1000 is now in scientific notation alright everybody so that's a few things that you can do with the format method it's an optional method that gives users more control when displaying output if you would like a copy of all the code that we've written here today i will post everything in the comments down below don't be afraid to smash that like button drop a comment down

w6hL_dszMxk,Python tuples 📋,2020-11-30T18:28:45Z,hey what's going on people it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain tuples in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you wouldn't mind please like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm so tuples they are collections which are ordered and unchangeable they're very similar to lists but they're ordered and we can't change them they're useful for grouping together related data let's say we would like to create some sort of student record so we can create a tuple to take care of that for us so let's say we would like to create a tuple called student the process of creating a tuple is very similar to lists but instead of using a set of square brackets to place all of the values within we're going to use a set of parentheses and now we can add a bunch of values related to this collection of student so let's add some student information let's say that this student's name is bro let's give him an age as well as a gender all right so there you have it we now have a tuple called student and let's take a look at some of the functions related to tuples and you can access them by typing student dot and then there are a few here not as many as lists we have count and we have index so we can find the count of how many times a value appears let's count how many times the value of bro appears so we'll need to put this within a print statement so we can actually see it so bro appears one time within this tuple there is also an index method as well so type the name of your tuple dot and we will use the index method we can find the index of a certain value let's say we would like to find the index of mail and then i will just print this to the console window so the index of the value male would be at two zero one two that's it for the methods available to tuples a few tricks that you can do with tuples is that you can display all of the contents within a tuple using a for loop let's say for x in student we will print x so this will iterate once through all the values found within our tuple of student and we can also check to see if a certain value exists within our tuple using an if statement let's say if bro in student if this is true then what do we want to do let's say print bro is here all right so since bro is within here this will be true and this will print our statement of bro is here all right everybody like i said this is a super quick video on tuples they're very similar to lists except they are ordered and unchangeable if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below and don't forget to smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
v5p_SUfi710,Java methods explained in 10+ minutes! 📞,2020-10-19T14:36:36Z,hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain methods in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you can become a hero and save our channel by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro all right welcome back guys and gals in this video i'm going to explain methods a method is a block of code that is executed whenever it is called upon for example when we begin our program and execute it we begin by calling the main method that's where we've been writing a majority of our code so anything within this set of curly braces belongs to this main method this time we're going to create our own method that we can call whenever we need it so outside of our main method make sure you don't write this within the main method we're going to create a another method perhaps a method that will display a message such as hello and to begin creating a method we'll need a return type i'll explain return types later on in this video for now we're going to list the word void followed by a method name our main method is called main and a common naming convention for methods is to have the first letter lowercase so let's create a method called hello when we call this method it will display a message such as hello so this will be hello with a lowercase h then we need a set of parentheses and then a set of curly braces anything within the set of curly braces belongs to the hello method and if we call the hello method it's going to perform whatever code is between these two curly braces so what would we like to do when we call this method let's display a message such as hello now within our main method we can call also known as invoking this method so within our main method we can call the hello method whenever we want now we have just one issue that we need to take care of and let me explain we cannot make a static reference to the non-static method hello from the type main so this means that we need to precede this method with the keyword of static because we're calling the hello method from a static method of main right here so normally we do not need to add this keyword of static and if you want to learn more about things that are static i do have a video on it but for now we just need to add this keyword in order for this program to work for this example so when we call the hello method it's going to perform whatever is within our block of code and here it just displays the word hello and we can call this method whenever we want and however many times we want so if we want to display the word hello three times we can just call the method three separate times and this method will perform its task its block of code however many times it is called one feature available to methods is that we can pass a value or a variable to a method when we call it for example we can pass a string variable to represent a name and then we can use that name for something within our block of code so for example let's pass in a name of whatever your name is let's say bro we can pass in a value or a variable so for this example i'm going to pass in a variable called name string name equals pro and i'm going to pass my variable of name into my method so if you want to pass a value or variable to a method when you call that method within the parentheses just list all of the values that you would like to pass to your method the values or variables that you're sending to a method are known as arguments and they can be confused with what's known as parameters in order to pass some values or variables to a method when we declare our method we need a matching set of what's known as parameters think of these as the rules in order to call this method we need a matching set of arguments and parameters currently these are not matching we're passing in a string but there is no matching parameter so this is how to set up a parameter for a method we're first going to begin by listing the data type of the value that our method is expecting so we're passing in a string as an argument so we need a string parameter so we need to first list the data type followed by a name for this value just to make it simple i'm going to call this name so we now have a matching set of arguments and parameters and now since we're passing in our name variable to our method of hello our hello method now has access to a string variable of name and it contains this value of bro so now we can use this name for something let's display hello plus name and when we call this method and pass in our name it's going to display the word hello plus our name hello bro so with parameters you don't necessarily need to keep the names of the values consistent i could change this name to something else like title i guess and then i will switch that around and this will work just the same so these don't necessarily have to be called the same thing the argument and the parameter you can change the name if you want even something like this would work too i don't know why you would write it like that but you can so with methods you can pass in more than one argument as long as you have a matching set of parameters this time let's pass in an integer value let's create an integer variable called age hint age equals and i'll set this to 21 this time so within my hello method i'm going to pass in my name and edge as arguments to my hello method however we have a problem if i attempt to run this we do not have a matching set of arguments name and age and parameters we're passing in a string and an integer and our method has parameters set up to accept only a string so we need to finish setting up the parameters for this hello method so that the arguments and parameters match so we need an integer and we will call this age and then we can use this age variable for something so within another print line statement let's display u r plus h and now this will work because we have a matching set of arguments and parameters and before we finish this video i would like to explain return types we can return a value back to the area in which we called a method so for this example on return types i think this can be best explained with a separate example so i'm going to clear out all of this and create a new example let's say we have two integer values into x this will equal maybe three and into y this will equal four well let's create a method that will add these two numbers and return the sum the result of these two numbers so outside of the main method let's declare a method static normally we would type void if we're not returning anything but if we're going to be returning a value we need to list the data type of the value that we're returning if we're going to add two integers together and return the sum we're going to list the return type as integer because that's the data type of the value that we would like to return we would like to return an integer and then we will list the method name let's call this add parentheses and then a set of curly braces so we cannot normally finish compiling this because if we're listing a return type we need to list a return statement what do we want to return well we're going to return an integer but we'll have to get to that later so let's begin by setting up the parameters for our add method let's say we would like an integer let's call this x and int y so in order to call the add method we need to pass in two arguments two integers so let's call the add method and pass in our variables x and y and within the add method we will add these two numbers together we could store this within a separate variable into z equals x plus y and then we could return our value of z so when we run this what's gonna happen well it doesn't display anything that's because when we return the value of z to this area in which we called our method well we're not currently doing anything with this value so we could store this within a variable or display it directly to the console window so let's store the sum within int z and z equals add x and y so you may have noticed that we declared this variable twice in z within our main method and within our add method this is technically legal because they are known as what's called local variables int z is only recognized by anything within the immediate set of curly braces it's known as a local variable add method does not recognize this int variable of z so we could declare our own to use or you can rename it too it doesn't really matter what you do so we can store the sum of our add method within int z and then do something with it such as display it to the console window system.out.line z so this will display the sum of seven another way in which you could write this we don't necessarily need to store the value in which we're returning to a variable we could just directly display it to the console window too so within my print line i'm going to call the add method and pass in x and y and this will still display seven another way in which we could shorten our method is that we don't need to store the sum within a variable we could just return x plus y so let me clear this line and we could return x plus y and this would be valid too so that's another way of writing this well everybody those are methods they are really just a block of code that is executed whenever it is called upon you can pass in values or variables known as arguments but in order to do so your method when you declare it needs a matching set of parameters and then you could return a value if you need to instead of using the word void just list the data type of the value that you're returning so if you would like a copy of all this code i will post everything in the comments down below and don't forget to smash that like button

Rn16ugyorX0,Java for loop ➰,2020-10-19T14:36:25Z,hey how's it going everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about for loops in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you can become a hero and save our channel by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro hey what's going on people let's talk about for loops a for loop executes a block of code a limited amount of times compared to a while loop a while loop could continue infinitely depending if its condition remains true with a for loop this will execute a limited amount of times so before we even begin the for loop we already know how many times that this for loop is going to iterate so let's create a program for an example that will count from 0 to 10. we can do this with a for loop so this is how to create a for loop type in the word for a set of parenthesis and then a set of curly braces so with our parentheses we add a condition along with two other statements so there's three parts to this for loop the first part is that we can declare a sort of counter or index so we will declare int index and we can set the sequel to zero and then add a semicolon so what a lot of people do is that they shorten index to i it's more shorthand with our second statement this is our condition we would like to continue this for loop as long as i is less than or equal to ten because we stated that for this program we would like to count from zero to ten now this third portion we will increment our counter i by one after each iteration so our for loop at least within the parentheses has three separate statements we declare a counter or index we call it i but it's not necessary that's just a common practice this is our condition we will iterate this for loop as long as this condition is true and then we can increment or decrement our index let's take a look at this how many times is this for loop going to iterate well it's going to iterate a total of 11 times because we're counting zero as well so let's test this with a print line statement we will display our index of i so this will count from 0 to 10 and then stop so let's do the reverse now let's start at 10 and count down to 0 and then display a message such as happy new year so with our index let's set this to 10 and change our condition to continue as long as i is greater than or equal to zero and then with our index we will decrement this by one and then when we exit the for loop let's display happy new year so we will start at 10 count down to zero and display happy new year now with this statement we could increment this or decrement this by more than one if we wanted to count down by two we would write this as i minus equals two so now this will execute a total of let's see one two three four five six times another way of writing this for loop that is optional is that you can move this third statement to within the for loop and this will work much the same as it did before it's just an optional way of writing this so that's what a for loop is it's similar to a while loop except that it will execute a limited amount of times compared to a while loop that could execute an infinite amount of times with for loops within the parentheses there are a total of three statements an index that you can declare a condition and then you can increment or decrement the index by a certain amount so that is for loops if you would like a copy of this code i will post this in the comments down below please be sure to do me a favor and smash that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
GvbdMwfjB98,Java toString method 🎉,2020-10-06T18:08:33Z,hey it's you bro hope you're doing well in this video we're going to be discussing the two string method in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running welcome back guys and gals in this video i'm gonna be teaching you guys all about the tostring method this is a special method that all objects inherit it returns a string that textually represents an object so let me give you an example i have another class called car and a few variables related to cars such as a make a model a color and a year and i took the liberty of assigning these values already so it's a ford mustang that's red and the year is 20 21. now we have four variables here right what if we wanted to display all of these values so first we need to create an instance of this class we're going to create a car object we can do that by stating car let's call this car equals new car alright and in order to display all of these values within our car class we would need a bunch of print line statements luckily i just copied and pasted what i had before so within a print line we would print the cars make the car's model the car's color and the car's ear so if we were to run this this will display all of the values the textual representation of this object now what if we displayed with a print line statement car instead of one of the attributes so within a print line statement i'm going to instead just type in car and what the heck is this all right so let me explain this is the address of this car object in memory it's like the street address like one two three fake street so this is the address where you can find this car object in your computer's memory so normally we're using the tostring method and all objects will actually inherit a tostring method so if we were to type in the name of our car dot we actually have access to a tostring method and by default we actually call the tostring method behind the scenes implicitly when we use a print or print line statement so if i were to type car dot to string it's going to do the exact same thing which we have here so it's going to return the address of where this car object is in memory but what many people do is that they will override and change the tostring method to instead print a textual representation of this object and that's what we're going to be doing in today's video now within our car class we're going to be overriding the to string method method overriding is a different video so if you'd like to learn more about it feel free to check out that video so let's override the two string method and have it do something else so this is a public method it's going to be returning a string so instead of saying void we're going to be returning a string and the name of this method is the to string method make sure you spell it exactly like this now it's asking for us to add a return type so we're going to return a string back to the tostring method when we call it so let's make up a string let's call it my string it really doesn't matter what you call it for the most part and let's declare what my string is my string equals now we can actually return all of these values in string representation so my string is going to equal let's say make and we can format this however we want make plus maybe a new line plus model maybe let's add another new line the color plus a new line and the ear and that should be it all right another way in which you can write this that only has one line of code instead of declaring the string my string we take all of this copy it delete the first line and return everything like that so that's another way of writing what we had before done in only one line of code so this is going to return a string representation of all of these attributes of our car it's going to return the make the model the color and the ear so now if we were to run this we're going to be using our car's two string method and instead of getting an address of this car we're going to get a textual representation of this object all of the attributes that this car has the make the model the color and the ear so this is an explicit use of the two string method and not only can we use the tostring method explicitly but we can use it implicitly so let's write another print line statement but this time we're going to only print the name of our car and the result is no different it's exactly the same so we're implicitly using the tostring method of our car when we use a print or print line statement so you can use either one you can either call this tostring method explicitly or implicitly but the point being is that you can override the tostring method to return a string representation of all of the attributes of an object so that's how the tostring method works in java if you would like a copy of

Lvnb83qt57g,Java abstraction 👻,2020-10-06T18:08:20Z,hey what's going on everybody to bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about the abstract keyword in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm all right let's talk about the abstract keyword so this is a keyword that can be applied to both classes and methods when you define them let's begin with abstract classes an abstract class cannot be instantiated but they can have a subclass that can be and here's an example i have two additional classes a class called vehicle and a class called car that extends vehicle so car is the subclass also known as the child class of the vehicle class and we can create objects from both of these classes and let's try that so first let's create a car car car equals new car and let's also create a vehicle object because we can so vehicle vehicle equals new vehicle so we can create instances of both of these classes just fine but we may not want to be able to do so so adding the abstract keyword to a class adds a layer of security so here's an example let's pretend that we walk into a car dealership and we ask a salesperson for a vehicle and they might reply with well what kind of vehicle are you looking for are you looking for a car a motorcycle a truck and we just say no we want a plane generic vehicle and they might think you're crazy because a vehicle is too generic it's an idea it's abstract well at least it should be abstract we need a certain type of vehicle so what we could do to prevent somebody from creating an instance of a class that is too vague or abstract we can use the abstract modifier when we declare this class so with vehicles let's add the abstract modifier and we can no longer create an instance of this class and it says cannot instantiate the type vehicle so this adds a layer of security to this program so in order to get this to run we cannot declare a vehicle object we have to pick a certain type of vehicle a child class of the vehicle class whether it's a car a bike a truck whatever now we can also create an abstract method too so let's declare this within the vehicle class and an abstract method is declared without an implementation so that means without a body so let's say that all vehicles should have a method to go because that's the point of a vehicle so all vehicles should go this is going to be an abstract method we're going to use the abstract keyword we need a return type we'll just make this void and this will be go and we do not need a body for this method and if we attempt to add a body a set of curly braces well we're going to have a problem and this says abstract methods do not specify a body so what this does is that it forces us to implement this method in one of the child classes that our vehicle class has so if we attempt to run this actually you can see that it's popping up already the type car must implement the inherited abstract method vehicle.go so what we could do is add unimplemented methods and what we're doing is actually method overriding so we can add our own implementation of this go method more specifically for cars so let's say maybe the driver is driving the car and that should be fine so we can no longer create an instance of the vehicle class because it's abstract and a vehicle object is too vague so we would like to force a user to pick a certain type of vehicle a class that inherits from the vehicle class and we can also use the go method that is found within the vehicle class too but we are forced to override it or implement it in each of the child classes that our vehicle might have and it's just the same as what we would normally do with calling a method so car dot go and this will print the driver is driving the car so that's the whole point of the abstract keyword it adds a layer of security to your program and this can be applied to both classes and methods if it's applied to a class a user cannot instantiate an instance of an abstract class and with abstract methods they are declared without an implementation but a subclass or child class has to implement that somewhere well that's the basics of the abstract keyword if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the abstract keyword in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] you
oKZnHNM9Ew4,Java super keyword 🦸‍♂️,2020-09-29T21:09:53Z,hey what's going on everybody to bro hope you're doing well and in this video we're going to be creating some superhero objects using the super keyword in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you too can become a hero and save our channel by punching the like button throw a comment down below and smash the subscribe button well okay everybody let's talk about the super keyword this refers to the super class also known as the parent class of an object that's assuming that you're using inheritance it's very similar to the this keyword this refers to the class that this keyword contains and super is referring to this object's parent class so here's an example i have two additional classes a class called person and a class called hero like a superhero that extends the person class so let's set these two classes up what are some attributes that a person would have they would probably have a name and an age so string name and edge then let's also create the constructor for this class but we'll set the parameters up later and then for heroes let's assume that all heroes have a superpower so this will be string power and let's also create the constructor for this class called hero now when we create a hero object let's say that we want to pass in some arguments so let's create our first hero object hero let's call this hero hero1 equals new hero and then we'll send some arguments to our constructor for hero so let's say we want a name an age and a power in that order so our first hero will have a name of batman and then an age of maybe 42 and batman's power is well he's rich so his power is money all right now we need to set up the parameters for our hero constructor so we need a string an integer and a string again string name ins age and string power and we are going to assign these values to each of the attributes that our heroes have so this dot name equals name this dot age equals age and this dot power equals power now the way that i have written this does work but it's actually not the best way to do this since we declared our name and age variables within the person class we should really assign these values within the constructor for the person class and with our hero class we only declared a power variable so we should assign the power value within the constructor of this specific class so what we would like to do is send our name value and age value to the super class to the constructor of the superclass and if you want to get the attention of the superclass you have to use the super keyword and the super keyword works very similar to the this keyword this refers to this class that we're in super refers to the super class also known as the parent class which in this case is person so we would like to call the constructor of the superclass person so we have super setup that's referring to our person class and now we need to call the constructor so all we do after super is add a set of parentheses and that is it and we would like to pass in the name and age value as arguments so let's do that name and age and we no longer need these two lines we can simply put these within the constructor of our superclass person and our person constructor will take care of that for us but we also have to set up the parameters for name and age string name and int edge and that's it so you can see that that error went away so when we create a hero object we're going to pass in a name an age and a power and when we construct a hero object we have our parameters set up a name an age and a power because all heroes should have a name and age and a power so we're immediately going to send our name and age values to the constructor of the super class which is person and the person constructor will take care of that for us because that's its job to assign names and age values to those variables so then we can actually print out all of these values system.out.printline hero1 dot name and let's do the same thing for age and power hero1.age and hero1.power and this should display everything batman he's 42 and his power is money so let's create another hero for another example so this will be hero2 and this will be superman i don't know how old superman is but let's say he's 43 and his power well he can do a lot of things so let's just say his power is everything and let's get rid of these print line statements because we won't need them anymore all right so one thing we can do too is use the super keyword to call a method within the superclass so let's say our person class has a tostring method to display the name and the age variables so let's create that so we need to add the public keyword to this there's a separate video on that public we're returning a string and this is the two string method and all we're going to do is return our name and our edge so return this dot name i'll add a new line just to format this plus this dot edge and a new line and we should be good so here's where the super keyword comes in let's say we have a tostring method within our hero class as well and i'm just going to copy this and make a few changes so we also have a tostring method within our hero class so what we could do is first return the name and the edge so we would like to call the tostring method of our super class so we're going to use the super keyword dot and use the to string method but we would also like to add the power that we have so we're just going to tack on plus this dot power and that's it and let's display hero 2's attributes so system.out.printline hero2.2 string and this should display all of the attributes that our hero has superman he's 43 years old and his power is basically well everything so that's the basics of the super keyword it's really referring to the superclass of an object whereas this refers to this class well that's the basics of the super keyword if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the super keyword in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me

nRJWltqX4UY,Java object passing 🏬,2020-09-29T21:09:35Z,hey how's it going everybody it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can pass objects as arguments to a method so sit back relax and enjoy the show make sure you like comment and subscribe one like equals one prayer for the youtube algorithm well well well welcome back ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can pass objects as arguments so let me give you the rundown of what i have so far here i have a main class as well as a class called garage and a class called car what we're going to be doing is sending our garage class some cars so we can park some cars in our garage so let's create an instance of our garage class and an instance of our car class so let's create a garage object garage let's call this garage equals new garage let's also create a car car i'll name this car equals new car and i'm going to set up a constructor for this car class let's say that all cars should have a name so string name let's declare this variable and within the constructor of our car class we'll set up one parameter of a string that will be called car this dot name equals name now if we were to instantiate an instance of the car class we need to send a car name so let's say we're attempting to park a bmw within our garage class so let's create a method within our garage class called park so this is void it's not returning anything and we will call this park because we're going to be parking cars all right we need to set up the parameters for this method so we first list the data type kind of like what we did with the parameter for our string so the data type is string but this time since we would like to pass in our car to the garage the parameter is going to be car kind of like what we did with our string because strings are also objects and then a name for this car we can keep the same just to be consistent but really you can name this whatever you want like that but i don't know the point of naming it that but whatever so let's just call this car car and what we can do is just maybe have a print line statement such as the car dot name is parked in the garage and that should be good for now so in order to call this park method of our garage we need to send a car to park so we type in the name of the class garage well the name of the instance of the class garage dot and we do have a park method here and you can see that we need to send a car in order to call this method if i attempted to run this it's not going to work just like that so in order to park a car using the garage's park method we need to send a car object so let's send our bmw garage dot park and we're sending our car the bmw is parked in the garage now let's park a second car so let's create a second car i'm going to call this car 2 and rename car as car 1. car 2 equals new car and let's say that this is a tesla and this time i'm going to park cartoon so garage dot park i'm going to send a different car object i'm going to send car 2 this time so we're going to park car 1 and car 2. so the bmw is parked in the garage and the tesla is parked in the garage as well so in conclusion you can pass objects as arguments to a method but when you declare that method you have to have the parameters set up to accept objects of that data type so for our example we have the data type of car so we can only send in cars to our garage to park if we had an additional class such as bicycles and created a bicycle object well we could not use the park method of our garage to send in a bicycle object because we can only pass in cars because that is the parameter that we set for this park method so that's the basics of sending objects as arguments if you would like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's how to pass objects as arguments in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] you
nhIB2S6NiFA,Java array of objects 🍱,2020-09-29T21:09:31Z,hey what's going on everybody it's your bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create an array of objects in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show you too can become a hero and save our channel by punching the like button throw a comment down below and smash the subscribe button alright guys and gals in this video i'm going to be explaining how we can create an array of objects now here's a few examples of arrays that we've worked on in the past so the standard formula or steps to creating an array is to type in the data type that we're working with a name for this array equals new the data type again and then a size if you don't plan on assigning values right away from the beginning when you declare this so we have an array of integers an array of characters and an array of strings so what if we wanted to create an array of objects for example i have a class called food we're going to be storing some food objects within an array so following these simple steps let's begin creating an array of objects so we begin by typing in the name of the data type that we are working with the name of the data type that we are working with is food for this example so we're going to type in food followed by a set of straight braces and then we need a name for this array so we could call this foods but i don't think that would make too much sense so let's pretend that we're placing food in a refrigerator equals new the data type again which is food and then a size if we do not plan on assigning values right away so let's say that this refrigerator can hold three food items so we now have an array that can hold some food objects for us now let's create some food objects so let's do this after we create our array called refrigerator so let's create three foods to store within this refrigerator so we type in the name of the class which is food let's call this food one equals new food and let's set up the constructor of our food class so it's the same name as the class and let's say we want to set up a parameter for a name string name this dot name equals name and then we need to declare this outside the constructor string name so when we create a food we need to pass in a name so for food one let's say that this is pizza it will create a food 2 item and a food 3 item let's say food 2 will be a hamburger we'll pass that in as an argument and food three will be a hot dog so we now have three food items now we are going to store these food items in our array of food objects our refrigerator as we call it so in order to do that we type in the name of the array followed by an index so this always begins at zero because computers always start with zero so our refrigerator at index zero let's store food item number one which is our pizza and for index one we'll store food two and index two will store food three and for practice let's attempt to access one of these elements of our array of food objects called refrigerator and display it to the console window so we can do that with a print line statement and let's attempt to access whatever food object is at index zero so refrigerator index zero and let's see what happens now remember that this returns the array of where this object is in your computer's memory so this is the address of where food 1 is located in memory what i'm trying to do is access the name variable of our food object so i'm going to tack on dot name to the end of this because we have a name variable for all of our food objects so this will print the name of whatever food is in element number zero of our refrigerator which is pizza and we can do the same process for the other elements too so i'm going to print element number one as well as element number two so if we were to take a look at all of the elements within our refrigerator we have pizza a hamburger and a hot dog now there's another way of writing this too instead of declaring our array of food objects called refrigerator and setting a memory size this time we're going to declare our array of food objects and assign all of these values right away so after we create our food objects let's declare and assign these values to our array of food objects so we type in the name of the data type followed by a name refrigerator equals and then within curly braces all of the values that we would like to add we would like to add food 1 food 2 and food 3. and we do not need these lines anymore so we can take these out and this will do the exact same thing but we changed the order of these steps around so that's the basics of arrays of objects in java if you'd like a copy of all this code i will post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of arrays of objects in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button

l7IMBy4_nhA,Let&#39;s code a CLOCK PROGRAM in python! 🕒,2020-09-16T13:58:58Z,hey what's going on everybody bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a clock program in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right my fellow bros in this video we're going to be creating a clock gui program so we'll need a few imports from tk enter import everything and from time import everything as well we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and in this program we're going to be creating three separate labels one for the time another for the day of the week and another for the date so let's begin with just displaying the time and work on the day of the week and the date later so let's create a label for the time called time label equals label we're adding this to the window and let's set the font because we can i'm going to choose maybe ariel and then a size of 50 so that this is somewhat large i'm going to change the foreground color that is the font color and i will pick a hex value of green so that is zero zero f zero zero but feel free to pick whatever color you want and i'm also going to set the background color and you can pick a hex value or a color name i'm just going to say black and then i am going to pack this label time label dot pack now we're going to call a function and we'll call this update and we'll define what this does after every second has passed we will use a recursive function to keep on updating the time every one second or so so let's define what this function does def update there is a function within the time module called strf time which we can use to return the current time and format it however we want so we're going to actually place this within a string variable and we'll call this time string and this function is strf time i'm actually going to go to python's website just to give you an example of how this works here we are on python's website and this is the strf time function and this converts a tuple representing a time as returned by gm time or local time to a string as specified by the format arguments so when we call this function we can pass in directives as arguments based on what we want to display if we want to display the current time there is a few directives that we can pass in so let's say that we want a 12-hour clock as represented by a decimal number between 1 and 12 well we would pass in percent i as an argument if we want the minutes that would be right here percent m and if we want the seconds that is percent s so we're going to pass in these directives as if they are arguments so within this function we'll pass in those format specifiers or directives so i want percent i followed by percent m and percent s all right uh but these also have to be within quotes so don't forget that because i just did okay this will display the current time oh then we also have to update our time label so time label dot config text equals our time string because remember that this returns a string of text text equals time string so this will display the current time and right now it is six in the morning or so however we just get one long jumbled number so it would be a good idea if we separated some of these numbers so within our strf time function i'm just going to add some colons to separate these values and this will display the current time it is currently 6 46 in the morning let's add am or pm to the end of this so the directive for that is percent lowercase p 6 46 am now how do we update this label every one second to reflect the current time well that's a good question and i'm glad you asked it so we're going to use the time labels after function we pass in a delay and then a function that we want to call after that delay so let's say we want to call this function update every 1000 milliseconds or one second so we'll pass in the delay as an argument 1000 milliseconds and the function that we want to call and we're going to perform what is known as a recursive function we're going to call a function within itself so after 1000 seconds we're going to call update again and it's going to repeat the process it's going to return the time and format that time and update our label with the new time so what ends up happening now is that our clock is going to update every 1000 milliseconds now let's add a few other labels let's say the day of the week i'm going to copy what we have here and let's rename this as day label but i probably don't want this to be the same size for the font let's say ink free because i like that font and a size of maybe 25 and i'll get rid of the coloring it's the same process as before really so let's replace time string with day string the directive for strf time to display the day of the week is percent a and we're going to replace time label with day label text equals day string and this will display the day of the week and it is currently wednesday and if we want to display the current date we can create a label and we'll call this date label and i'll make the font slightly bigger maybe 30. we'll copy what we have for our day string and rename this as date string so we have a few options for the date i want to display the name of the month the day and then the year so that would be percent capital b percent lowercase d i'm going to add a comma to separate the day and the year and percent capital y and then i want to set the text of my date label to my date string so that this will now display the current date there's just one quick change that i think we should make right now we have three different labels a time label a day label and a date label and right now we're using the after function of the time label so since we have all of these different labels i think we should replace time label with our window because our window has an after function as well so that after 1000 milliseconds has passed we can update the time the day of the week and the date all right so that's the basics of creating a simple clock program in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating a clock in python hey

Kmgo00avvEw,Java Swing GUI Full Course ☕,2020-09-14T15:00:12Z,
KcEvHq8Pqs0,Java 2D canvas graphics 🖍️,2020-09-10T14:00:05Z,hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can paint some simple 2d graphics in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody let's create some 2d graphics but before we begin here's my setup that i have so far i have two classes a class called main that just contains my main method and an instance of my other class called my frame and this class my frame extends jframe so it behaves exactly like a jframe within the constructor for my frame i have this dot set default close operation jframe exit on close i'm using a size of 500x500 this dot set location relative to null this allows the frame to appear in the middle of the computer screen and not just the top left corner and lastly this.visible is set to true now i'm on oracle's website looking up some java documentation and for the component class the component class is a parent class to many of the java gui components that we work with there is a paint method underneath the component class and this has a parameter of graphics g it takes a graphics object and what this paint method does is that this method is called when the contents of the component should be painted such as when the component is first being shown so most if not all gui components actually have component somewhere as a parent class somewhere down the line and with our my frame class we're going to be overriding this paint method and be drawing some stuff so within this my frame class let's define and declare what we want this paint method to do so we'll say public void paint and this has a parameter of graphics a graphics object and we'll just call this graphics g so g is going to be our graphics object and this paint method is actually called behind the scenes it's invoked automatically when we instantiate a component such as a j frame so we do not need to explicitly invoke this paint method it'll do so for us behind the scenes now with graphics it's somewhat outdated we're actually better off using something called graphics 2d which is an updated version graphics 2d is a child class or subclass of the graphics class and what we're going to be doing is casting our graphics g as a 2d graphic so for the very first line after we call the paint method we're going to cast this graphics g object as a graphics 2d object so let's say graphics 2d and let's call this instance g to d equals g and then we need to cast this so within parenthesis we're going to add the cast graphics to d now this graphics 2d object has more options available to us as to what we can draw and do compared to a graphics g object now let's attempt to draw a few things so there's a few methods available to us to do that so let's say g to d dot and there are all sorts of things that we can draw let's begin by drawing a simple line so that's dot draw line and there are a few parameters a starting point x and y all i guess starting coordinates and then ending coordinates of where you want this line to end so if our frame is 500 by 500 let's draw a line from the top left corner to the bottom right and the coordinates for the top left corner of the frame would be where x is 0 and y is 0 and since the size of the frame is 500 by 500 the bottom right corner would be where x is 500 and y is 500 so there's just going to be one problem with this this will draw a line however it's not necessarily in the starting position that we thought it would be so here's the issue with our frame the size of the frame also includes this window bar at the top so with the starting coordinate it's actually starting in the top left of the window and this window bar is somewhat overlapping our graphics area in which we can display so it may be better for us if we were to create a panel draw on the panel and then add the panel to the frame so let's actually create a class called my panel which will extend jpanel so let's create one more class and then we're going to draw on this panel so file new class we'll call this my panel and then click finish my panel extends jpanel so it will behave exactly like a jpanel and then we'll need to import something as well and then we'll need a constructor for my panel okay now going back to my frame we're going to change a few things we're going to get rid of this paint method and since a panel a jpanel is considered a component we can actually call the paint method so take the paint method from my frame and paste it within my panel and then we'll want to create an instance of my panel so let's declare this outside of the constructor my panel and we'll call this panel and then instantiate it within the constructor panel equals new my panel and we'll need to add this panel to the frame so let's do that right about here this dot add we're adding our panel and we no longer need a size and we should probably pack this so after you add all the components that you want follow this with this dot pack so this should fit nicely now what's going to happen is that this is going to create a panel for us and then we should probably set a size for this panel too before i forget this dot set preferred size new dimension and we'll make this 500 by 500 what ends up happening now is that this panel is fully visible before we were drawing directly on the frame and this window bar at the top is part of the frame so it was overlapping a portion of the visible area so now this entire panel is fully visible to us let's head back to our my panel class and draw a few things within the paint method so we drew one line let's change the width of the line this is kind of like the stroke the brush size that we're using so we can actually change that g2d dot set there's actually all sorts of things that you can set but we're looking for set stroke and we can pass in a new basic stroke and then we set the size of the stroke so if we want this to be 5 pixels we'll pass in 5 and what we get is an extra thick line and it's not just a 1 pixel brush stroke you can also change the color too so g to d and this would be dot set paint and you pass in a color so let's say we want this line to be blue color dot blue you can also pass in uh some hex values or some rgb values too but we'll just stick with simple colors so now we have a blue line going across the screen let's draw a few other shapes for now i'm just going to comment out this line where we draw a line let's draw a rectangle we type in the name of our 2d graphic which is g2d dot draw and there's all sorts of things that we can draw let's draw a rectangle and this is draw rect like get rekt so we place starting coordinates as arguments as well as a width and height for this rectangle let's say we want this to begin in the top left corner of the panel so that would be where x is zero y is zero and let's make this one hundred by two hundred if you want this to be a square you can make this one hundred by one hundred so now we have a rectangle on our panel and it retains that blue color that we set as well as the stroke size that's kind of like the line thickness so if you need to draw another graphic you can actually set the paint color to something else before you actually draw this let's set this to pink i don't know why i just picked a random color and now we have a pink rectangle and if you need to fill this that's actually a different method that would be fill rect so that would be g2d dot fill and you can fill all sorts of shapes here we're looking for fill rect and we'll keep the same coordinates so 0 0 then 100 and 200 for the height and here's our rectangle in the top left corner of the screen and it is completely filled one important thing that you should keep in mind and know is that as you're drawing graphics any more recently created graphics are going to overlap any previously created ones so if we were to draw this line and then draw our rectangle the rectangle is going to overlap this line kind of like there's a z-axis so anything that is more recently created is going to overlap any previous items or graphics let's draw a circle next and i'll get rid of our rectangle that we have as well as this line we'll just turn these into comments if you need to draw a circle you use either draw or fill oval g2d dot let's draw an oval first so this will be just an outline draw oval now the coordinates are the top left of the drawable area for this oval so if we want this to start in the top left corner of the panel that would be where x is zero y is zero and let's make the width 100 and the height 100 i suppose and we should have a actually let's change the color to g2d set paint let's make this i guess orange kind of like it's the sun i suppose yellow would work too we'll keep the same stroke size of five and we have a orange outline of a circle or oval and if you need to fill this in you would instead use fill oval which will do g2d dot fill and we're looking for oval and we'll place this at the same coordinates same width and height too and we have an orange circle or oval in the top left corner of our panel okay this next one is a little tricky this is draw arc and let's set a color so we're actually going to use draw arc to draw a pokeball for practice g2d dot let's draw arc first then fill arc draw arc and there's a few more arguments starting coordinates a width and a height a starting angle and an arc angle so we'll place this in the top left corner just to keep things simple for the width let's make this 100 and the height 100 so for the starting angle let's set this to zero and the arc angle will make this 180. so this will be a half circle because it's 180 degrees now if we were to change the starting angle let's say 180 it's going to flip counterclockwise let's practice drawing a pokeball so let's set the paint to red for the top i would say hemisphere and set this to zero and we're going to use fill arc and we'll get rid of draw arc actually we should uh get rid of the stroke size too all right so we should have a red half circle and the bottom is going to be white but i'm not sure how well this is going to display so let's set the paint after we fill the first arc and color this white color.white and we'll have the starting angle be 180 but we'll keep the full extent of the arc at 180 so it's another half circle and we should have a pokeball or at least something that slightly resembles a pokeball i would say that's close enough since we're just beginners at this all right we can also draw a triangle and for that we'll actually use a method called draw or fill polygon and we actually have to pass in an array of coordinates or integers so this would be g2d dot let's begin with draw draw polygon okay so this takes an array of integers and a number of points a triangle would be three points so let's just pass in three points but we'll need to pass in an array of integers so let's declare these right before we actually draw this polygon so we'll say int x points and we'll pass in some x coordinates let's say 150 250 and 350. we'll pass in some y coordinates as well so this has to be another array of integers and this will be y points let's set this to 300 150 and 300. and we should have the outline of a triangle let's set this to yellow so that would be g2d dot set paint and we'll pass in color dot yellow now we'll fill the polygon it's the same process as before but replace straw with fill and we have a yellow triangle it's kind of like a piece of the triforce from the legend of zelda series well one of them at least we also have the capability of drawing a string of text on our graphic g2d dot draw string we pass in a string as an argument as well as coordinates for the string let's say you are a winner so for now let's set the x coordinate to zero and the y coordinate to zero but when we compile and run this we actually cannot see the string that's because it's hidden right now let's change this to 50 by 50 and you'll see why so now the string is visible that's because when we display the string the starting position of our string of text is the bottom left corner since we set this to 0 0 well that's going to be the very top left corner of our panel so it's actually not being displayed because it's kind of off screen now let's change the font and the font color of the string g2d dot set font and you can pass in a new font and pass whatever font you want i will pick ink free because i like that font that's a font family then we can pick a font style let's say bold and a size i will make this 50 i suppose you are a winner and changing the font color is the same process as before we just set paint to whatever color we want what color do we not pick yet let's pick why not magenta and the font color is now magenta let's say that you want to add your own image to this graphic i have this png file and it's called sky and i just created this myself so i want to add this image to my graphic my 2d graphic so there is a method to do that g2d dot and that is draw image and there's a few to pick from uh so let's begin with something simple uh here so this takes an image coordinates and then an image observer we have not covered image observers so we're just going to set this to null for now so we need an image and coordinates we want this to begin in the top left corner now we need to create an image out of this file that we have within our project folder let's call this image and we're going to declare and instantiate this so let's say image image and then within the constructor we'll instantiate this image equals and this is a little bit different we're going to create image equals new image icon and list the file name or the file path sky.png is my file name follow this with dot get image this will create an image out of the image icon and then we follow this with draw image and then add your image here and we should have our image added to our graphic and then you can draw on top of this image this could be a background image let's say so i'm going to move this and place this near the top and let's draw i don't know maybe the triforce that we have so i'm going to re-enable all these why not the pokeball too well yeah that image that we created is kind of serving as a background for us so that's how you can include your own image into a graphic to display well everybody that's the basics of creating 2d graphics this video is getting kind of long so i think i'll cut it off here i was hoping to walk you guys through some practice with drawing a simple landscape kind of like what bob ross does with his paintings but i might have to wrap it up here so if you want to copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating 2d graphics in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing

4bMU1xAolSg,Python tkinter how to add window tabs 📑,2020-09-02T15:22:16Z,hey what's going on everybody to bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create separate tabs for our gui applications in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay let's begin so in order to create tabs for our python gui application we're going to need access to a widget called notebook and that's found in a different module so this time we're going to need two imports so at the top from tk enter import just everything but the notebook widget is found within a separate module so we'll need a second import from tk enter import ttk so this ttk import gives us access to several different widgets that are normally not available to us so once you have these two imports you're ready to begin so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop and we need to create a notebook widget so right after you create your window we're going to create a notebook we'll call this notebook equals ttk dot notebook and we want to add this notebook to our window so let me add a comment here what this widget does so this is a widget that manages a collection of windows and displays and that's really all there is to it so in order to create different tabs we're going to create some frames so for the first tab i'll call this tab 1 equals frame and we want to add this to the notebook and with our notebook we're adding this notebook to the window all right so this will be a new frame for tab one and let's create a second tab and we'll call this tab two and you can create more tabs if you want but that might be overkill so this is a new frame for tab two after you finish these two lines of code we're going to follow this up with notebook dot add so notebook dot add what widget are we adding we're adding our tab one frame and we can set some text for this tab so text equals and i'll type in tab 1 and we'll repeat the process for tab 2. so notebook.ad tab 2 and we'll change the text to tab 2. and then we need to pack this notebook notebook dot pack and let's take a look to see what we have all right we have tab one and tab two but we'll probably want to actually add something to each of these tabs so that the content is visible so let's create some labels so after we pack our notebook let's create some labels i don't really feel like giving these names because we don't really plan on using them for anything else so we'll just say label tab one that's going to be the parent widget and let's set some text text equals hello this is tab number one then i think i'll give this a width and a height too just so it's more visible so for the width i'll make this 50 and the height 25 so this will be roughly a square shape and then we need to pack this so i'm just going to add pack and let's create a second label for tab two so label tab two maybe i'll say goodbye this is tab number two okay we should have some actual content for these labels now for these tabs so here's the label this is tab one and this is tab two and you can switch between these and they display each of these separate labels however with the way that this window is arranged if we were to expand the size of this window well our frames and our tabs kind of stay in the top and in the center so i'm going to add a few lines within the pack function of our notebook the first thing i'm going to do is use the expand option and set this to true so what this does and i'm just going to add a comment that expand this will expand to fill any space not otherwise used so what happens now is that this will actually expand and it's staying in the center of the window but there's one more thing we're going to add fill equals both normally this is x or y or you can do both so i'll add a comment as to what this option does so fill will fill on x and y axis so if you combine both of these together what you get is that these tabs will stay in the top left corner and if you were to expand the size of this window the tabs aren't going to move they're going to stick to the top left but the size of the window will expand all right so that's the basics of creating tabs in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating tabs in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] you
A6sA9KItwpY,Java select a file 🔎,2020-09-01T16:11:29Z,hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use the j file chooser class in java to select a file someplace within your computer so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people let's just get right into this so we're going to be discussing the j file chooser class this is a gui mechanism that lets a user choose a file we're only going to be selecting a file today i have other videos on loading files and saving files so this is helpful for opening or saving files if you want to look for a file that's someplace within your computer or within your project folder so let me show you my setup real quick i have two classes a main class and then a my frame class i have a new instance of my frame within my main class my frame extends jframe implements the action listener interface i have a constructor called my frame this dot set default close operation j frame x and on close i'm using a new flow layout this stop pack and this dot set visible to true now to launch the j file chooser we're probably going to need a button so let's create a button to do so so let's say j button button equals new j button and i'll add some text maybe select or better yet select file alright and then i want to add an action listener to this button so button dot add action listener since this class is implementing the action listener interface i just pass in this and then we need to add this button to the frame so this dot add and we're adding the button all right so we need to check if we are clicking this button then we're going to launch an event so if e dot get source is equal to our button however this action performed method does not recognize this button so we need to declare this outside of our constructor so j button button and then we do not need to declare this twice alright so when we click on our button and let's just try this real quick so we have our button and says select file in the top corner so we're going to launch a new instance of our j file chooser class so in order to do that we need to first declare it j file chooser and we will call this file chooser equals new j file chooser alright so now if we were to run this and we click on select file it currently doesn't do anything well that's because we didn't set it up to do anything yet we only declared and created a new instance of file chooser so the next step is that we are going to either show open dialog or show save dialog we're not actually going to be opening or saving any files just getting the location for the file so let's go with show open dialog and then i'll show you show save dialog right after so in order to do that to open our dialog menu it is the name of our file chooser file chooser right here dot show either open dialog or save dialog let's just go with open all right and then if you have a parent component you place that in here but we don't have one so we're just going to put null for now so what this does is that i'm going to add a comment this will select file to open all right so i currently have a file on my desktop and this is what this currently looks like it's going to bring you to your default directory of where you usually open files and i have a file on my desktop and it is called hello world all right so you can select a file to open and there's different uh files of type where you can search through these but i'll show you that later so let's say we want to open this file well where is it alright so there's a few other steps so with file chooser.show open dialog it's going to return an integer value think of it as the response and i'll actually print this with a print line statement so system.out.printline and i'm going to place this within the print line statement and i just want to show you what this returns exactly all right so i'm going to go to my desktop and then i'm going to attempt to open this uh file again so open okay so this returns zero so that's kind of like the response based on what button we click if i were to click cancel it's going to return one or if i click x it's going to return one as well so we can actually do something with this perhaps we can store this within a variable so i'm going to create an integer variable called response int response equals file chooser dot show open dialog and then we can check to see if response is equal to zero but there's another way of writing this if response is equal to zero that's one way or what we could do is write j file chooser dot approve option and that would be better so if somebody successfully selects a file and does not click cancel or click x button then we can actually create a new file we can store that so let's declare a new file file file equals new file and the file path for this is going to be file chooser dot get selected file dot get absolute path all right and then we'll probably need an import for this file as well okay then let's print the file path for this file so we can do that with system.out.printline and we're going to place the file name here so then what happens is that when we select a file let's say i want to go back to my desktop and select that hello world file this is going to get the file path and currently it's on my desktop so we don't necessarily need this print line statement but it's just proving that this file actually has a location too so then i have other videos on loading a file or saving a file using scanners or print writers but we'll save that for another video actually i think i'm going to keep this print line statement just because we have more to do okay now we have show save dialog currently with show open dialog we can select a file to open and we have an open button alternatively we have show save dialog so that is file chooser.show save dialog so i'm going to change open to save and i'll just turn this first line into a comment because we don't really need it anymore so this will select file to save all right it's the same process as before really but now we have this save button and we can attempt to save a file but there's still more steps we have to follow for actually creating a file i have a separate video on that so if i wanted to save something to my desktop this could be test file dot txt then i'm going to click save currently this won't actually create a file but here it's just printing the file location and it's set to my desktop all right so that is show save dialog now one other thing that we can do too is that we can set the current directory because right now it's just going to the default for my computer and that is my documents folder and we can actually change that so in order to do that it is file chooser dot set current directory and we pass in a new file and we specify the file path within this new file so one trick if you want to place this within uh set the current directory to your project folder that would be just a dot within quotes so this is going to go to my project folder and the project name is gui swing so you can see that that changed otherwise i could place a file path here so if i wanted the current directory by default to be set to my desktop i would place the file path for my desktop and for my desktop this is the address now if i were to run this and select a file the default directory is now my desktop and i can attempt to open or save a file here well that's the basics of the j file chooser class and in a future video we're actually going to be creating a text editor app and we'll need to use the j file chooser class so if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of the j file chooser class in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] you
uGmMsGOcBB0,Learn Python tkinter GUI drag &amp; drop easy 👈,2020-08-31T16:18:18Z,hey what's going on everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can drag and drop widgets in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right people let's just dive into this so we'll need a window and then we're going to be adding widgets to the window so window equals tk followed by window.main loop now you can drag and drop all sorts of widgets but let's just stick with the label because creating a label is simple so let's define a label label equals label we're going to be adding this label to the window and let's set a background color so we can actually see this label pick i don't know your favorite color i'm going to pick red and then i'm going to set a width and a height because normally if you have a label without any text it's really small so let's set a width of maybe 10 and then a height of 5. that should be good and we want to place this label someplace within the window so label dot place and we can pass in some x coordinates as well as y coordinates so x equals zero and y equals zero so that this is going to appear in the top left corner of our window so this is what we have this is our label and we want to be able to drag and drop this label someplace within the window what we're going to need to do is actually bind this label twice but let's begin with just the first binding so in order to bind a widget you type in the name of the widget followed by calling the bind function so this bind function can take two arguments it can take an event as well as a function name so for the function name let's call this drag underscore start but you don't really need to name it the same that i do and for the event that occurs this is going to be a left button click with the mouse so that event is within quotes and within angle brackets button dash one so if we were to click someplace within the label using the left mouse button it's going to call our drag start function but we need to define this so at the top of our program let's define this function def drag start and this takes one parameter the parameter we have is our event so what we're going to do is actually get the coordinates of where we click within this label and we're going to assign these to a new variable or attribute of our label so label dot let's create an attribute called start x equals our event dot x so this is where we click within the label and not necessarily the window and let's repeat the process for y so label dot start y equals event dot y so we're going to have some coordinates of where we click within this label and we can actually use that for our next function so we're going to bind this label a second time so i'm going to copy this line and paste it the second binding let's say is drag underscore motion for the function name and this event is going to occur if we were to hold down the left mouse button and then drag so that is b one dash motion and then we need to define this function so at the top d e f drag underscore motion and this takes our event as a parameter so this part is going to be a little funky we're going to get or create new x and y coordinates so let's begin with x x equals the name of our label or widget label dot w info underscore x this is a function so add some parentheses this will get the top left x coordinate of our label relative to the window that we're in minus label x well labeled.startx plus event dot x all right so we're going to do the same thing for y well we're going to replace x with y for the second line all right so this is the top left corner the x coordinate of our widget relative to the window this is the place where we click within the label itself and this is where we begin dragging our widget to it's a little difficult to explain but if you can combine all of these together you'll get the new coordinates of where you want to drag this component this widget to so we need to replace this widget so label dot place x equals x and y equals y so then when you combine all of these together we have our widget and we can drag it and drop it someplace else within the window now wait a second what if we have more than one widget well with the way that our functions are written now they wouldn't be compatible with more than one widget just this label itself so what if we were to create a second label so i'm going to call this second label just label two so i'm just going to rename them and let's change the background color to maybe blue and i'm just going to place this somewhere else within our window so maybe where x is 100 and y is 100 and we'll need to bind label two as well so make sure to bind label two so we have label one binded it's just called label and the same thing with label two all right let's see what happens i'm going to attempt to drag label 2. the label 1 is moving that's because with our functions we stated we're getting the coordinates and we're storing them within the attributes of label 1 and not necessarily label two so in order to make these functions compatible with all widgets we can actually add one line of code widget equals event dot widget so this is going to get the widget of the event that we're dealing with and we're going to temporarily rename this as widget so now we're going to replace all instances of where we use label and replace it with widget so be sure to do the same thing too with drag motion and then we will need to add this line at the top of drag motion so now these functions are now compatible with any widget that we create and we should be able to drag and drop both widgets all right well that's the basics of dragging and dropping widgets in python if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of dragging and dropping widgets in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing

EAxV_eoYrIg,Java combobox 📑,2020-08-25T15:02:33Z,hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys all about combo boxes in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right all you wonderful people let's discuss j combo boxes this is a gui component that combines a button or editable field and a drop down list we can create a drop down list and select one of a few different items so before we begin here's my setup i have two classes a main class that contains my main method and then a myframe class which extends jframe and implements the actionlistener interface and then within the main class i just created an instance of my frame so within this my frame class i have a constructor this dot set default close operation jframe max and on close we're using a new flow layout and we're going to finish this with this dot pack and this dot set visible set to true this is the standard procedure for us that we've been doing for this gui tutorial series and then we also have an action performed method that will respond to certain events now let's create a j combo box i'm going to place that here so let's first declare this that is j combo box and we will call this combo box equals new j combo box now we have our combo box but we need to populate this combo box with a listing of different options that the user can select so when we construct this j combo box we can pass into the constructor an array of reference data types these can be objects or they can be primitive data types but you have to use the wrapper class let's say that we want a drop down menu of animals and a user can select one of these so a string is actually a reference data type but it has to be an array so we'll create a string array called animals and let's fill this array with some animal names so let's say dog and then cat and then baby bird so with this array of animals we can pass this into our constructor when we create our j combo box and then lastly we just need to add this combo box to the frame so this dot add and we are adding our combo box and then when we run this we have a drop down menu a combo box and we can select one of these items however it currently doesn't do anything so within the action performed method we need to fill in a few things and actually whenever we select one of these items it's actually triggering an event so within the action performed method we will create an if statement if e dot get source is equal to our combo box then what we're going to do well we can do one of a few things but first this action performed method does not recognize our combo box that's because we declared this combo box within the constructor so it's local we need to turn this global by declaring this outside of the constructor so j combo box combo box and we do not need to declare this twice since we're declaring this combo box within the class everything within the class now recognizes this so our action performed method now recognizes this combo box so if our combo box does something then what we could do is get the current selected item so let's type in the name of the combo box combo box dot get selected item and then i'll just print this so let's put this within a print line statement so system.out.printline i'm going to copy this and paste it system.out.printline combobox.getselecteditem however we need to add an action listener to this combo box because it still doesn't return what we want basically so we need to add an action listener to this combo box so let's add that here combo box dot add action listener since this class is implementing the action listener interface we can just pass in this and this will work just fine then so then whenever we select an item from this j combo box it's going to trigger an event and get the current selected item so let's say we want a dog well we have a dog cat and then bird another method that functions similarly to get selected item is get selected index so for now i'm just going to copy this and i'm going to turn this into a comment so we can ignore it and then we're going to use the get selected index method instead so combobox.get index and this will return the index of what we select so this always begins with index zero so dog would be zero it prints zero bird would be two and then cat would be one here's a few helpful methods that you might find useful for combo boxes and in order to use these methods we type in the name of the combo box dot and here's a bunch of the different methods available to you let's begin with set editable and we can set this to true and what this does is that when we set the editability to true we can actually type in something to look for so let's say that i want to select cat i can just simply type in cat or i can select it from this drop down menu and it returns that item that we selected let's go over a few others so we can actually get the item count so that is combo box dot get item count and then we'll need to display this so let's put this within a print line statement so system.out.printline combobox.getitemcount and this prints the current amount of items which is three we can also add an item later so combo box dot add item so we need to pass in an object a reference data type let's pass in a string maybe a horse so with add item this will add an item to the end of this so now we have dog cat bird horse we can also insert something at a certain index so combo box dot insert item at we need an item and an index let's say we want pig for the first item at index zero so let's pass in a string that says pig and then an index zero so this should be at the beginning now however it's not currently selected see pig is at the top but dog was selected so we can actually set the selected item at a certain index when this runs so in order to do that it's combo box dot set selected index and you pass in an index so if i were to set this to zero it's always going to select index zero when this first so now our item pig is now selected because we have set selected index set to zero and our item pig is now set to zero we can also remove it item two so let's turn these into a comment just to ignore these so combo box dot remove item and let's say we want to remove our cat because our cat ran away but don't worry he'll come back so now we only have dog and bird we can also remove items at a certain index so combo box dot remove item at let's say zero so whatever item is at index zero it's going to remove that this time our dog ran away he went to go chase the mailman so we only have a cat and a bird and i have one more for you guys so combo box dot remove all items and this will clear our combo box so that there is nothing within here so this could probably be useful for something if you need to reset it one thing that you should remember is that with these j combo boxes we need to pass in an array of reference data types for example if we attempted to pass in an array of integers well since this is a primitive data type this actually wouldn't work let's say we're attempting to store the numbers one two and three and add these to our j combo box so in order to do something like this we would have to use the wrapper class version of this so for integer it is integer with a capital i and you spell it fully if this were double instead of lowercase double this would be capital double because this is the wrapper class version of a double so just make sure that you're using wrapper classes if you need to store a primitive data type within an array all right so that's the basics of combo boxes in java if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of combo boxes in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] you
GwxvLzQoMYM,Java checkbox ✔️,2020-08-21T21:43:41Z,what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create a simple checkbox in java so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running all right everyone we're going to be creating a j check box this is a gui component that can be selected or deselected so let me give you a rundown of my setup that i have we covered this in the last video so we have two classes a main class it doesn't really matter what you call it as long as it contains a main method we're going to create a new instance of my frame so my frame will extends jframe so it behaves exactly like a j frame but it also implements an action listener interface within the constructor of my frame i have this dot set default close operation jframe exit on close we're using a flow layout manager we're going to pack this frame and set the visibility to true and then we'll also need an action performed method so we can listen for events all right once you have all that we're ready to begin this is how to create a j check box so within the constructor for now i'm just going to declare a j check box j check box and we will call this check box equals new j check box we'll probably need an import so include that and then i'm adding this checkbox to the frame so before we pack this this dot add the name of your checkbox and this is what we have so far just a simple selectable checkbox but we'll probably want to add some text we don't know what we're selecting exactly so after we create this checkbox let's set the text you can either pass this into the constructor or we can use the set text method so check box dot set text and we'll place some sample text like i'm not a robot seriously guys i'm not and this is what we have now i'm not a robot last time i checked i wasn't so there's this annoying border around the text we can get rid of that you have to set focusable to false check box dot set focusable and that will take care of that issue so this text is somewhat small and difficult to read we can actually change the font too check box dot set font new font and pass in whatever font you want you can copy me if you want so console us font plain and then a size 35 is good but doesn't matter what you pick that's a little bit easier to read so what can we do with this let's create a button and when we click on this button it's going to tell us if this is selected or not so let's create a button before this checkbox so that's a j button we'll call this button equals new j button and we'll need an import as well and let's set some text you can either pass this into the constructor a string or we can use the set text method so button.set text and i will set this to submit we're also going to need to add an action listener so button dot add action listener since we're implementing an action listener interface we can simply just pass in this alright so we have an action listener that's attached to this button when we click on the button it's going to trigger this action performed method so we need to check to see if the event that happens is equal to the button so if e dot get source is equal to our button now let's take a look at this button this button is not recognized or this action performed method does not recognize this button that's because we declared this button within the constructor so we should make this global by declaring this outside of the constructor because right now it's only local to everything within our constructor so i'm going to copy this portion paste it and we do not need to declare this twice so at the top j button button then button equals new j button so then our action performed method now recognizes this button and we'll need to do the same thing with our checkbox so check box equals new checkbox now we're going to determine to see if this checkbox is selected so there's a function to do that check box dot is selected and this is going to return true or false for now i'll just print this so system.out.printline and we're going to print the result you can also assign this to a variable too that would work as well and let's try this i'm not a robot oh we need to add the button crap let's do that so this dot add button i sometimes forget to add components you will too probably alright i'm not a robot cool this says i am not a robot now i am a robot now i'm not now i am so did you guys know you can actually change the appearance of this checkbox we can set this to an image so i have a few images that i want to use this picture of an x i just called this x.png and a picture of a green check mark so i want to change the check box to these images when the check box is deselected or selected so i'm just going to create some image icons feel free to pause the video if you want to look for some icons that you want to use so image icon i will call the x icon just x icon and then we have another image icon and i will call this check icon and then i will finish instantiating this within our constructor right here is good i suppose all right so x icon equals new image icon and we list where this is located since this is within my project folder i can just list the name so that is x dot png and i'll do the same thing for my check mark icon here so that is check icon and the name is checkmark.png to add an icon to a checkbox when it's deselected you type in the name of the checkbox and we use the dot set icon method and we pass in an icon that we want to use we want to use this x icon which is the red x that we have and this is our icon however if we were to click on this it doesn't appear to do anything even though we can toggle this between checked and unchecked selected or deselected so we're also going to combine this with set selected icon so check box dot set selected icon and i'm going to use my check icon and then now when we run this we can actually change the image when we select this checkbox alright so that's the basics of creating a simple checkbox in java if you want a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of creating a check box in java hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music] [Music] you
q8WDvrjPt0M,Python GUI open a file (filedialog) 📁,2020-08-10T17:50:00Z,hey what's going on everybody it's you bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can use a file dialog in python to open and read the contents of a file so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay people so this is how you can use file dialog to open and read the contents of a file but first we'll need a second import along with this import at the top so what we're going to be importing is from tk enter import file dialog and then we'll need a window like what we usually do so window equals tk followed by window dot main loop now we'll need a button that we're going to add to the window and when we click on this button it's going to launch our file dialog so we can select a file so we'll call this button button button equals button let's set some text maybe to just open like we're opening a file and we'll associate a function to our command for this button so let's create a function called open file that's fine and then we need to pack this button so we can add it to the screen so button.pack now we need to create a function called open file and we'll do this before we create our window let's type def open file and when we call this function we're going to take file dialog and use the ask open file name function so this is going to return a string and that string is the file path of where your file is located so what we could do is store this within a variable so let's store this within a variable called file path and to test this let's just print this just to take a look at the contents of this variable so let's just print the file path now i have a file on my desktop that i want to use called test file so let's click the open button and this might not necessarily bring you to your desktop it might bring you someplace else within your file directory so this just happens to be bring me to my desktop so i'm going to click the test file that i have and click open so this prints the file path so it's going to return a string and it's the file path basically so now we want to open and read the contents of this file so we don't really need this print line anymore so what we'll do is create a file variable and we're going to use open we're going to list the file path and then we're going to use r for read so the default is normally rt for read text otherwise you can read binary uh but we can just set this to r r is the same as rt basically uh so then we're going to open this file and then we're going to read it so let's just print this to the console window so print the name of the file which is file where this is located file dot read function and then it's a good idea to close your files after you're done with them so file dot close and let's test this so i'm going to click open find the file that i want click it and then open and that text file says my name is bro i like pizza now let's say you want to make this a little more advanced so what i'm going to do is that i'm going to set the initial directory of where we begin looking for a file when we launch our file dialog so with that test file i'm going to move this to my project folder so i'm just going to paste it so now this is within my project folder now i'm going to set the initial directory within the function of ask open file name so we're going to set the initial d i r for initial directory and then we can list a file path so one thing you could do i want to get this path here this file path so if you're using pycharm what you could do is right click this copy path and then get the absolute path and then i'm just going to paste this and then with these backslashes you'll have to do double backslashes because this is the escape character for a backslash all right so this should open my project folder which it does and here's that test file thing we could do is that we can change the title of our file dialog right now the default is just open so we can change that to something else so i'm going to add a comma maybe put this on a different line so this is still within the function of ask open file name so i'm going to set the title to something else i'll say open file okay so if we were to run this again instead of just saying open it says open file okay and we can also limit the file types that we accept and look for so we can use file types so let's say that we want to initially look for a txt file so what we'll do is type in like a name for the file that we're looking for so this is what's going to appear to the user uh text files followed by an extension so we want asterisk dot txt and then we can also have an option for all files so i'm going to add a comma for a second option and then let's say all files and then an extension so comma asterisk dot asterisk this will look for all files uh but i think i am missing a parenthesis there that should be good so then when we open our file dialog it's going to initially be looking for plain text files and with this drop down menu it says text files and all files so that's what we have listed within our file types of what we want to search for so you can see that if i switch to all files our python file actually appears because we don't have any limits on the files that we're trying to open or search for so if i change this back to text files only folders and plain text files are visible so then we can open our test file again but yeah that's the basics of file dialog in the next video we're going to be saving a file so if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of opening a file using python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down

LI8KQ3pjQug,Learn Python tkinter GUI colorchooser easy 🎨,2020-08-09T16:37:17Z,hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys about the color chooser module in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay everybody so before we begin we'll need a second import so let's add this at the top so from tk enter import color chooser and the reason that we need a second import and it's not included with this first import is because this is a sub module it's not necessary to add this comment i just like to add comments for teaching purposes so make sure you have these two imports before we begin now we'll need a window and a button that we can add to the window and when we click on the button we're going to select a color and change the background color of the window so let's create a window window equals tk followed by window dot main loop and then let's set the geometry so we're going to change the background color of the window after we select a color so let's select a fairly large size for a window maybe 420 by 420 so this is the width and the height and then let's create a button so button equals button let's set some text text equals click me and we're going to set a command for this button that is called so we're going to create a function maybe called click and then we just need to pack this button so we can add this to the window so button.pack now we're going to need to create a function and we'll call it click so when we click on the button this function is going to be called so def click and what do we want to do after clicking this button what we're going to do is take color chooser and we're going to use the ask color function so currently this is what this does we can select a color after clicking this button and pick whatever color you want then you hit ok however we need to store this color within let's say a variable so we'll create a variable called color color equals color chooser dot ask color and then we can do something with this color but for now let's just print this color just to take a look to see what it contains so print color so let's say that i want this green color click ok this is what this prints this is our color so this is the rgb values that we have in this first element so this is the amount of red then green and then blue and the second element is the hexadecimal representation of these values so what we want is this hexadecimal value so what we can do is create a second variable to store this so let's just call this color hex color hex equals color and we're going to get the first element well technically it's the second element but it's the element at position one so this one this is zero index zero so we're going to basically extract this hexadecimal value and let's just print this just to be sure that it's working fine so print color hex and let's try this again but select a different color maybe i want this purple color then click ok so this is cb42ff and here we have cb42ff now let's change the background color so since we have this hex value that's actually fairly simple so we're going to take window dot config bg for background color equals color hex and this will change background color and let's set this to a sky blue color maybe like this click ok and it changes the color however it's not really necessary to continue printing these values you can take these out if you want and this would work like just the same then now this part isn't necessary but if you want you can condense these three lines of code that we have for our click function into less lines of code so what you could do instead of assigning the value of color at index 1 to a separate variable we can take color at index 1 get rid of this line and assign bg equals color at index 1. so now this is done with just two lines of code and why stop there we can write this with just one line of code so now we're going to take color chooser dot ask color get rid of this line bg equals color chooser dot ask color at index one and now this is done with just one line of code however it's a i would say a little more difficult to teach so that's why i kind of like to separate this line by line so if you want you can condense all of this into just one line of code so here's some ideas of where the color chooser sub module could be helpful so of course you can change the background color too but let's say that you're creating a game and you can customize your character or avatar well it would be kind of nice if you could have some way for the user to actually change maybe the character's hair color eye color something like this would actually work fairly well so yeah that's the basics of color chooser if you would like a copy of all this code i'll post this in the comments down below but that's the basics of color chooser in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment

SGTtoHO6loo,Learn Python tkinter GUI messageboxes easy 💭,2020-08-08T17:58:42Z,hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to teach you guys how we can create message boxes in python so sit back relax and enjoy the show if you find this video helpful please remember to like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running okay people let's create some message boxes but first we'll need an import so from tk enter import message box and what this will do is import the message box library so it's not necessary to add this comment uh so we'll need a window window equals tk followed by window.main loop let's create a button so button equals button we're going to add this to the window we're going to set the command to execute a click function that will have a message box appear when we click on the button and let's set the text so text equals click me and then we will need to pack this button so button.pack now we'll need to create a click function so let's do that at the top def click and what do we want to do so there's a few different message dialog boxes that you can use so let's begin with a basic show info message box so message box dot and there's a few options let's begin with show info show info this just displays a simple message so if we were to run this we have a button we click on the button and it's going to create a message box for us and it just shows some info but we don't really have any info to show yet so we can set a title and we can set a message so let's set the title title equals this is an info message box although part of the title got cut off let's also set the message message equals you are a person click me you are a person thanks i didn't know that so there's a few other message boxes that we can use too so for now i'm just going to turn this into a comment and i'll just copy this just to save some time and the next one that we have is show warning so this will have a different icon so the title let's say warning and the message you have a virus so now we get this annoying warning message but you can just click okay to get rid of it uh so one thing that you might see with tech support scams they'll have a message box like this that shows a warning but they'll put this within a while loop that's set to true so this will just continue on and on kind of like this so if we were to try and close out of this it's just going to reappear while true is true basically uh so that's just something funny that i wanted to show you so let's move on i'm going to turn this into a comment then the next one we have is show error so show error title set it to whatever you want error message something went wrong there's a few more sophisticated ones too we can ask for some user input so this next one is message box dot ask and there's a few to choose from let's go with ask okay cancel first we'll set the title title equals ask okay cancel and a message message do you want to do the thing so we can actually put this within an if statement so this returns either true or false depending on what you click so let's put this within an if statement if this is true print you did a thing if it returns false we can use an else statement else what else do we want to do we'll say else print you cancelled a thing and let's test this but i am forgetting a colon there do you want to do the thing okay you did a thing let's try it again do you want to do the thing cancel you cancelled a thing cool there's a few others so i'll turn all of these into comments and the next one we can go over is ask retry cancel and this is fairly similar to what we had before i'm going to copy this let's change this to ask retry cancel ask retry cancel do you want retry the thing you retried a thing or you cancelled a thing so it's very similar to what we had before do you want to retry the thing retry you retried a thing and cancel you cancelled a thing okay the next one we have is ask yes no so we can get some user input if it's a yes or a no so this returns a boolean value a true or false value so message box dot ask yes no and we'll set the title title equals ask yes or no and a message do you like cake so let's put this within an if statement because this returns a true or false answer print i like cake too else they answered no then if this is false print why do you not like cake and i'm missing a colon there we go so if they click yes this returns true and we execute this line of code i like cake 2. if they answer no it's going to execute this else statement do you like cake no why do you not like cake now what we have next is ask question and this doesn't return a boolean value of true or false it actually returns a string of yes or no so this is message box dot ask question and we'll set the title to ask question and a message message equals do you like pi so let's just print the result what this returns so print everything within here so like i said this doesn't return it true or false but yes or no so what we could do is assign the response to a variable such as answer so answer equals whatever the answer is whatever they click whatever button they click on so if our answer is equal to yes we'll print a message print i like pie too then else the answer is no will print why do you not like pie so do you like pie yes i like pie too do you like pie no why do you not like pie so this next one is probably the most difficult it's ask yes no cancel so it's message box dot ask yes no cancel it's this last one so let's set the title title equals whatever you want yes no cancel and a message message equals do you like to code so let's just print the results what this returns so print everything just so we can take a look so the possible answers are true false or none so we can just run some if statements for this so if answer is equal to true what we can do is print you like to code oh but we need to assign this to an answer so answer equals all of this else if answer is equal to false let's print then why are you watching a video on coding and then else the response is none so we can just use an else statement so else you have dodged the question let's try this do you like to code yes you like to code uh but this should really be a smiley face right do you like to code no then why are you watching a video on coding do you like to code cancel you have dodged the question no one other option available to you is that you can change the icon that you're using so let's say that we want to change this icon so right now it is currently this question mark so we can set this to one of a few preset icons so icon equals and let's set this to warning so instead of that question mark we get this yellow exclamation point and you can also use info it's just an i and error so do it fits best for you all right well that's the basics on message boxes in python if you'd like a copy of all this code i'll post all of this in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of message boxes in python hey you yeah i'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing

QEF62Fm81h4,Java TimerTask ⌚,2020-06-20T00:00:11Z,"hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to teach you guys all about timer tasks in Java and at the end of this video we're going to work on a project where we can have a countdown timer that will display a Happy New Year on New Year's Eve so let's get into it if you find this video helpful please remember to Like comment and subscribe your support will help keep this channel running alright everybody I have two definitions here for you the first is timer and this is a facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a background thread and basically what this means is that it keeps track of the time in a background thread and then we have timer tasks and this is a task that can be scheduled for one-time or repeated execution by a timer so this is a class that contains an abstract method called run and when our timer reaches a certain point a certain time it will execute a task either once or repeatedly and we can have that task be whatever we want so we're going to have a timer task that is linked to a specific timer so let's begin by creating an instance of a timer so we're going to type in timer and let's just call this timer with a lowercase T equals new timer and this will just keep track of the time but we'll need an import so let's add that now so import Java dot util dot timer now we're going to create a timer task so let's add that to the next line so timer task and let's call this task equals new timer task then a set of parenthesis then we'll need an import for this as well so make sure that you have these two imports now an easy implementation of the timer task is to add an anonymous inner class so with this timer task we're just going to add a set of curly braces after this and then we need to add unimplemented methods and it's just the run method so this timer task is going to be linked to this timer so when time is up it's going to execute this run function here so when our timer reaches a certain point it's going to execute this run function of our timer task instance so you can do whatever you want with in this run function but let's just start with something simple for this demonstration so I'm just going to create a simple print line statement that says task is complete now what we'll want to do is link this task to this timer so we can use the schedule function of this timer instance so I'm going to add that after our timer task so type in the name of the timer dot and we can use the schedule function and there's a few options here if you have intellisense there's a few variations and different ways to do this but we're gonna start with something simple so this schedule function has two arguments a task and a time and you can see that it filled in the tasks that we're gonna use within this first argument and the second is a time so this is normally in milliseconds so if you were to set this to zero and we ran our program this run function is going to execute immediately so let's try it and our task is complete now this is a delay the second argument so if we were to set this to 3,000 milliseconds there would be a three-second delay so you can see that it's not doing anything right now because it's waiting and once that delay is over then it executes our task so for our next example I just turned this line into a comment so you don't have to necessarily just pass in only a numeric value we can pass in a date here if we want this task to be completed at a certain date in the future so we can actually do that utilizing the calendar class so let's create an instance of the calendar class and set the date so we're gonna type in calendar and let's call this date equals calendar dot get instance and then we're going to set things such as the year the month the day the hour so on and so forth so we're going to type in the name of this instance dot set and then within parentheses we're going to type in calendar dot and there's a few recommendations here if you have in the intellisense setup so let's set the year and this is all in caps and then we're going to add a comma and we'll this for 2020 and then we're gonna do the same thing for like the month the day of the month the hour so on and so forth but I'm also gonna change the clock on my computer just to demonstrate this so let's have this task perform at like midnight this day basically so we're gonna do the same thing here and let's set the month so month and let's set this to June so that would be calendar dot June and let's set the day of the month so day of month and we'll set this to June 20th and then we'll do our of day so this is in military time so if you want midnight that's going to be zero so it's zero through 24 basically and let's set the minutes so calendar dot minute and we'll set this to zero then you can do seconds as well so ii will set that to zero and that milliseconds okay so this task is going to execute at midnight june 20th of the year 2020 so I'm actually going to fast forward the clock on my computer to demonstrate this but first we actually need to have this task so we'll add that after here so timer that scheduled task and then for the time what we're going to write is date dot get time and that's it so let's run this okay so here I changed the clock on my computer to just a minute before midnight so once it hits midnight it's going to execute this task so we got three seconds to u10 task is complete now birth they're an example we're going to use a different method of the timer class and that is the schedule at fixed rate method and what this allows us to do is to repeat a task every so often and I think this would be good for some sort of like countdown timer so let's create something like that so timer dot scheduled at fixed rate so this will take a task the time or delay of the first instance or when you want this to be executed and we're going to set this to zero for now and this third value is how often do you want this repeated let's say that we want this to repeat every one second so we'll put 1000 here for 1000 milliseconds so this run method is going to execute every second so let's create a countdown timer so we'll create a variable within here and let's call it counter and set this equal to ten and within this function let's create an if statement in place of this so if counter is greater than zero what we'll do is that we will just display whatever our counter is and then maybe add seconds and then we want to decrement our counter by one so counter - - alright so this is just going to keep on running so we'll want some weight to cancel our timer so we'll add an else statement and then within here why don't we display something such as Happy New Year so will system that out a print line happy new year and then in order for our timer to stop we type in the name of our timer dot cancel all right so since there's no delay on this this is going to begin immediately when we run this so let's try it so it began at ten seconds and it's gonna keep on going down until it reaches zero and then display happy new year so two one happy new year now let's take this even further so let's have this task begin right before New Year's Day like 10 seconds before New Year's Day on New Year's Eve and then we'll have a countdown timer and then once it hits zero midnight of New Year's Day it's going to display Happy New Year so we can use schedule at fixed rate and for the delay we're going to use date get time so I'm just going to copy this paste underneath for our next example and we're going to use date get time in place of our delay here and then we're going to set the day that we want this to begin so let's set this to let's set it to 2020 calendar dot December date of the month the 31st hour of the day so this is in military time so 23 minutes 59 and then seconds let's put 50 here okay so I'm going to move the clock on my computer ahead to just before this time hey you know what why don't I show you guys how to change the time on your computer so I'm currently doing this with Windows so I'm going to hover over the time right click adjust time and I'm going to set the date and time manually and let's change this to December 31st of the year 2020 11:59 p.m. and let's change it and run this okay so let's see the time right now okay so we have about a minute I'm just going to fast forward this video all right everybody our task is about to begin right about now so ten seconds nine seconds eight seconds I'll shut up now so four three two one happy new year alright everybody well that's the basics of timer tasks so you can execute some block of code either once at a specific time or immediately or repeatedly either immediately or at a set date in the future so if you want a copy of all this code I'll post this in the comments down below and yeah that's the basics of timer tasks in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if

-rJdMaSgt38,Java slider 🌡️,2020-06-09T22:57:29Z,hey I was it going everybody it's a bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm gonna be teaching you guys all about Jay sliders in Java and at the end of this video we're going to create a project where we can use a slider to adjust the temperature so let's get into it before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm alright everyone so AJ slider is a GUI component that lets the user enter a value by using an adjustable sliding knob on a track so to best demonstrate this let's create another class to keep things organized so go to your source folder go to file new class and let's call this class slider demo click finish and then we're gonna go back to our main class and create an instance of this slider demo class so we're going to type slider demo and we'll call this slider demo with a lowercase s equals new slider demo parentheses semicolon so let's head to that class and start working here so we're going to need a few things to import so make sure you have these three imports java.awt asterisk Java x-wing dot asterisk and Java x-wing dot event asterisk now with this class we're going to implement the change listener interface so next to our class definition we're going to type implements change listener so then with our slider we can actually update something whenever we make a change now we're going to add an unimplemented method and it's going to be state changed but we're going to save that for the very end first let's work on our constructor for this slider demo class so we'll just copy this and paste it at a set of parentheses and the set of curly braces now what we'll do is actually declare a few global objects here so the first thing is that we'll want a frame so jframe and we'll call this frame and that's it for now we'll actually instantiate these within the constructor we're also going to want a J panel so jpanel and we'll call this panel we'll need a label so J label label and lastly a slider which is the I guess the main piece of this lesson so to do that you need to declare a J slider J slider and we'll call this slider all right now going within our constructor here we're going to instantiate these objects so the first thing that will create is our frame so frame equals new J frame and let's set the text to slider let's spell it right slider demo and then we will want to instantiate our panel because we're gonna add the panel to the frame so panel equals new J panel will instantiate our label so label equals new J label and then lastly our slider so slider equals new J slider parenthesis semicolon okay now with the slider there's a few values that we can add so with sliders we can have a spectrum of ranges and then we can have the user add just a knob and then they can enter in a value that way so the first set of values is the minimum and the maximum set of numbers for our slider so let's say that we want somebody to adjust a knob on a track between the numbers 0 and 100 so what we'll do for the first number the minimum is enter in 0 and then separate it with a comma then you can enter in the maximum number so let's say 100 so maybe we're finding the temperature of maybe water between the temperature of 0 and 100 degrees Celsius so we're going to set a minimum of 0 and a max of 100 and now there's a third value can add this is the starting point for the slider let's say we want this to start in the middle well we could say 50 for the starting point now before we get ahead of ourselves let's add everything to the frame so first we'll add the slider to the and later we're going to add the panel to the frame so we'll start with panel dot add slider and we're also going to add the label to the panel so panel dot add label and then frame dot add panel and then let's set the size for our frame so frame dot set size and I like to pick for 20 by for 20 and then we need to set the frame to be visible so frame dot set visible true alright so first let's work on our slider then so let's set the preferred size for this slider so we type in the name of the slider dot and then we're going to use the set preferred size method we're going to type in new dimension and we're going to give a width and a height so for hundreds of decent height I mean with so 400 for the width and 200 for the heights pretty decent I would say let's actually see what we have so far okay yeah here's our slider then so it's just a bar that's adjustable there's no markings or anything so we need to add that later all right now what we're going to do is add paint tics so slider dot set paint ticks and within parenthesis we're going to place the word true so let's see what this looks like now all right so we also need to add the tick spacing so these are little I want to say notches that kind of give you an idea of the range of numbers so what we'll type in here is slider dot set minor tick spacing so how often do you want a notch in this slider let's say every 10 units every 10 of whatever you're counting by in our case it's degrees Celsius so let's try it now so these are numbered yet but you can see about every 10 we should have at least like 10 ranges starting at 0 then they go all the way up to there's a little like not cheer now we're going to set some major tick spacing so that comes next so I'm just going to copy this and we're going to change a few things so set paint track and we want this to be true and the next thing is set major tick space and let's set this to 25 okay now after each 25 units there's a larger tick these are major ticks and the small ones are minor ticks then and now with the slider we can actually add values to each of these major ticks and let me show you how to do that so I'll add that maybe right here so what we're gonna type is slider dot set paint labels and we're going to set this to true now we have our numbers for each of our major ticks but not the minor ticks and it gives our whole range between 0 and 100 and you can see that when we started this program it begun like right in the middle at 50 because we set this value this argument the third one to 50 the first one is the minimum which is zero and the second value is the maximum which is 100 so if you adjusted these numbers it would also adjust the numbers on our slider let's also change the font down here too so maybe I'll do that next so slider dot set font new font I really cannot spell today and maybe I'll give this a font of MV Bohle because that's one of my favorite fonts and then font dot plain we don't need to do any styling and I will pick a font size of 15 and let's see what this looks like now not too bad not too bad looks more modern now I would say so one trick you can do with this slider bar is that by default this is horizontal so we could actually change this to a vertical slider bar and that kind of resembles eight there rahmanir since we're taking the temperature so in order to change that to vertical then type the name of the slider dot set orientation and then within here we're going to type swing constants and then dot vertical and let's take a look yeah I would say that would fit a thermometer of sorts then if you want to change it back it's gonna be the same process but change vertical to horizontal and this is what we had previously but I think for this demonstration I'm going to keep it as vertical but I'll just turn this into a comment just so you have it for your notes alright let's add a label so we'll have a label underneath that will display the current temperature whatever this is set to so let's add that right underneath our slider but before we add everything to our panel and our frame now to set the text for the label type in the name of the label and we're going to use the set text function and then we're going to change the text so I'm going to insert the degree symbol I actually don't know how to do this normally so I copied it from Google then degrees C equals and then if we want to retrieve what the current value of the slider is set to we can add + slider and we'll use the get value function of the slider all right let's take a look at this now so it says it's set to 50 degrees Celsius but I think I'm going to increase the font so I'm just going to copy this paste it and change slider to label and let's set this to maybe 25 so it's more visible that's better okay so it's currently set to 50 but if we adjust this this number doesn't change so I'll teach you guys how to do that and we're going to do this within our state changed method so what we're gonna type in here is label dot set text actually we can just copy this and paste it that'd probably be easier so whenever the state changes for the slider it's going to execute this line of code and update it now the last thing that we need to do is that we need something to trigger our state changed method so we need to add a change listener to our slider and we can just add that here so type in slider dot add change listener and then within parentheses type in the word this so this should work now let's try it okay so the midpoint is 50 degrees Celsius the minimum is 0 which we have here in the max is 100 and now if we adjusted this slider this value is also changing whenever we adjust the knob on this track so it has a minimum of 0 and a max of 100 like we intended and it's adjusting whenever we actually moved the knob on this track then so that's how J sliders work it's a GUI component that lets the user enter a value by using an adjustable sliding knob on a track so if you're looking for extra practice your assignment is to post the code for a slider that you've made in the comments down below but yeah that's one of a few ways you can create a J slider in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in 3 easy steps

XhH93_woZIY,Java custom exceptions 🛑,2020-06-02T23:54:21Z,hey how's it going everybody it's bro here hope you're doing well and in this video I'm going to be teaching you guys how to create your own custom exceptions also known as user-defined exceptions there is a previous video called exception handling in this playlist so make sure you've seen that one before moving on to this video and at the end of this video we're going to be creating a project where we will verify somebody's edge for some sort of like fake membership and if they are under a certain age then what happens is that our custom exception will be thrown so that's it let's get started before you reach the end of this video make sure to LIKE comment and subscribe so that we together can challenge and defeat the mighty YouTube algorithm hey welcome back everyone so for this video I'm going to teach you guys how to create your own custom exceptions also known as user-defined exceptions so there's a video in this playlist called exception handling or something like that so you want to be sure to watch that before you watch in this video so just as a reminder an exception is an event after execution that disrupts the normal flow of a program so a few examples we've covered in the past where arithmetic exceptions if somebody divides by 0 for instance or an array index out of bounds exception and then file not found exception if we're working with files and we can't locate a file so we can create our own custom exceptions that can handle something very specific for our programs so a few ideas that I thought of where maybe like a duplicate email exception if somebody's signing up for an account and they're registering with an email and we do a database query and then that email already exists we can create a duplicate email exception to let the user know that that email already exists or maybe if somebody's paying with a credit card and they enter in invalid information we could create an exception called invalid credit exception I'm just making these names up by the way they're not actually exceptions but they're descriptive of what they can do and then one that we'll be working on for this project is age exception where maybe if somebody signing up for a membership or something online and if they're under a certain age we can throw a age exception and that'll let the user know that hey you're not old enough to sign up for this membership so that's just a few examples of custom exceptions that we can make there's all tons of different exceptions that you could do for very specific situations so let's get started what we're going to do is to create a new class so if you're using eclipse go to file new and then class and then we will call this the name of whatever exception we want so I'm just going to call this age exception and then we'll click finish now you're going to want your custom exception class to extends the exception class so this exception class is going to be the parent class for the child age exception or whatever else you called this class so we're going to set up the constructor for age exception so we're going to type in age exception parentheses and we're actually going to set up a parameter maybe a string and we'll call this message so if this exception is thrown we're actually going to display a message such as you're not old enough to sign up for this membership or something like that so within the constructor for your age exception class or whatever else you called this you're going to call the super constructor class so super and then we're going to send a message to here to actually take care of this message and that's it that's all we have to do for this class so just a quick summary of what we did here this age exception class if this exception is thrown we're going to pass a message that says something like you are not old enough to sign up and we're immediately going to take this message that's passed in and send it to the super constructor for the exception class and that's going to handle exceptions like it normally would so that's all that this class does we're going to do everything else within our main class then so let's accept some user input let's set up a scanner and we're going to ask the user for what their edges so we'll set up a scanner first we'll just say scanner and we'll call the skin equals new scanner system dot in and then we'll need to import something so make sure you have this import and then we'll create a prompt and we will have the user enter their edge so enter your edge and we'll place this within a variable and we'll call this edge so int age equals scan dot next int okay the next step we're actually going to create a method to check our edge so we'll call this method check edge and we're going to pass in the edge variable so with this check edge we're going to surround this with a try block and we're going to catch exception e and then we'll just print out a message so system dot out dot print line a problem occurred and then it's going to list what exception was thrown so we'll just say plus e which is the exception object now we need to create a method called check edge so it actually does something now outside of your main method we're going to create another method so this is going to be a static method it's void it won't return anything and it's called check edge and it's going to have one parameter set up it's going to accept an integer and we'll call it edge now we're going to have this method throws age exception and then we need a set of curly braces now with our check age method that throws age exception we're going to list the condition which will throw it new age exception so what we'll check is that if age is less than 18 then we're going to throw new age exception so if age is less than 18 what we're going to do is throw new than the name of the exception here so age exception in this case and then we'll pass in a message because we have it set up so this accepts a message as a parameter so maybe we'll add a new line character plus a message such as you must be 18 or older to sign up so if they're not less than 18 they're either 18 or greater than so maybe we'll put an else statement that says system dot out dot print line you are now signed up and that's it let's run this enter your age let's say that I'm 18 years old so that's the minimum requirement and it says you are now signed up so since we used this check edge method and our age was not less than 18 we used this else statement and no exception was thrown then now let's try it again so enter your age let's say that we're 12 years old trying to sign up and it says a problem occurred and it lists the exception that we have the age exception that we made and you can see that it occurs here it just does a print line of a problem occurred and it displays the exception object and here it throws the new age exception and it displays our custom message that we want to display to the user or it says you must be 18 or older to sign up so that's basically custom exceptions also known as user-defined exceptions so you'll create a custom exception for something specific in your own program and then you'll probably want to have a custom method that will throw that specific exception and within that your method that throws at that custom exception what you'll do is usually list some sort of criteria or condition where that exception is thrown or not thrown depending on how you want to write your program but yeah that's the basics of user-defined exceptions so if you would like a copy of all this code I'll post it in the comments down below and your assignment is to create a method that throws some sort of custom exception you made and then post it in the comments down below but yeah that's the basics of user-defined exceptions in Java hey you yeah I'm talking to you if you learn something new then you can help me help you in three easy steps by smashing that like button drop a comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro [Music]
ljEZlKU5XT4,C++ if statements (#6) ❓,2020-04-10T19:15:59Z,"hey what's going on everybody it's your bro here and in this video I'm gonna teach you guys how we can use if statements in C++ let's get into it if statements are pretty sweet because it's like a basic form of decision-making we can specify some condition and then if our condition that we specify is true we can have our program do something if that condition is not true we can skip that or have a program do something else so in C++ this is what you do to create an if statement you just type in if then you need a set of parentheses and then a set of curly brackets so anything within the parentheses will be our condition it's like the rule we're going to do whatever is within the subset of code between these two curly brackets if this condition that we specify is true so there's many different things we can use as a condition but I think we'll just start with something simple let's say that we want to check to see if somebody's age is equal to 18 first let's create a variable we can say int age equals 18 and then within the parentheses of the if statement we can check to see if age is equal to 18 honestly we can really do anything with this statements we can check just about anything but let's check to see if age is equal to 18 now if you're checking to see if one value is equal to another you don't just use a single equal sign that is the assignment operator so if you were to say age equals 18 well C++ thinks you're attempting to assign the value of 18 to the variable age so if you want to compare if two values are equal you need to use two equal signs and this is also known as the equals to comparison operator so basically if our age is equal to 18 we're going to do whatever is within the subset of code let's place AC out statement within these two curly brackets so we can just verify that the if statement actually worked so we'll say C out then use the insertion operator then let's display a message Congrats you are eighteen years old I'll just say Y oh four years old yo all right so let's try this out and our result is congrats you are eight years old so what if we changed age to a different number like 17 well let's see what happens when we try this so it doesn't appear to do anything and this is the reason why within our if statement within the condition of the if statement we're checking to see if age is equal to 18 since our age does not equal 18 it's 17 this is going to evaluate as false and it's going to skip over anything within your subset of code there's other comparison operators they should also be aware of 2 so this is the equals 2 of comparison operator it compares to see if two values are equal if you use an exclamation point then an equal sign this is the not equals comparison operator this will check to see if two values are not equal if both of these values are not equal then this entire condition will be true then so if we check to see if age does not equal 18 it will execute whatever is within our if statement so a more appropriate see out message would be something such as you are not 18 years old so let's try this out and see if a message displays this time yeah and it says you are not 18 years old and if we were to go back and change our variable age to 18 and then rerun this program well we don't get any result this time because we're checking to see if our age does not equal 18 currently it does equal 18 so this entire condition will become or evaluate as false so then if this is false we will skip whatever is within this subset of code for this if statement and we continue on like it never even happened there's other comparison operators to these you'll probably be a little more familiar with we can say things such as greater than or less than less than or equal to greater than or equal to so I'm thinking what we'll do for this will change our if statement to say if our age is greater than or equal to 18 will display a message Congrats you are an adult so we can basically change our age to anything our age variable that is let's say that we are 90 years old and we're going to check to see if our age is greater than or equal to 18 and it says it Congrats you are an adult well you know we're 90 years old so we've been an adult for a long time but yeah you can check to see if like numbers are within a certain range too and stuff and if we were to say our age is like perhaps 12 you know then run this well it's gonna skip over this if statement because our age is less than 18 it's not greater than or equal to 18 let's move on to phase 2 of if statements so there's this thing called an else statement if our condition turns out to be false normally we'll just skip over whatever is within the subset of code for the if statement we can use an else statement if we want our program to do something else so after your if statement just type in Els e4 else and then it has its own block of code then so basically our if statement is going to check to see if somebody is greater than or equal to 18 years old if it is or if that's true we will do this if not we will do something else so let's display a different message let's make a see out statement that says you are not an adult okay let's test this theory so our age is currently 12 so it says you are not an adult and remember before when we didn't have this else statement it just gift over the if statement completely but if you have an else statement it's going to instead do whatever is within the code block of the else statement so it's like you're at a fork in the road and your program is going to decide which path it's gonna take so I'll give you a visual example of this so here's a visual if this helps you understand it I actually copied this from a few other lessons on the same topic that I made in other programming languages so don't tell anybody but basically it works just the same so we have our variable age and when we reach our if statement if our age is greater than or equal to 18 we're going to go down this path and do something else with our program if our if statement is false we are going to use this else statement and our program is going to take this path and display a different message so this is like a visual representation if that helps you so with that being said I'd like to introduce a variation of the same program or something similar to it now with this if statement this condition will evaluate or return a answer of being true or false so what if you had a boolean variable we could create a boolean variable such as adult boolean adult equals and we can assign this value of true or perhaps false and that instead of having a condition such as age is greater than or equal to 18 you could just put the boolean variable name within here and it's kind of like the same thing it's going to check to see if this evaluates as true or false if adult evaluates to be true then we will display congrats you are an adult if adult evaluates as false then we will do whatever is within this else statement and since our boolean variable is set to false it displays you are not an adult but then if we were to set this to true then it's going to perform whatever is within the if statement then where it says congrats you are an adult so that's an alternative way to write something within an if statement because basically it's going to return a result of being true or false and if you are just to stick a boolean variable in here you can check to see if this variable contains the value of true or false let's move on to phase three on this topic of if statements and we're going to cover the else if statement so I think this is best if we were to create a entirely new program so what I think we'll do is that we will prompt the user to enter an eight temperature and if the temperature falls within a certain range we will display a message depending on what the user typed in for a temperature so to begin let's create a variable perhaps an int called temperature and we can just declare this we don't need to necessarily assign it a value right away and let's create a prompt to ask for a temperature and we will say please enter the temperature perhaps we'll put this in Celsius then we need to place AC in statement after this we will say temperature all right so this will prompt for a temperature and depending on what the value of temperature is we will display a particular message so let's write an if statement if I'm just gonna copy temperature because it's not that fun to type this out if temperature is greater than perhaps thirty degrees Celsius we will display a message so we'll say C out it is hot outside maybe I'll add an emoji here it's not required but I think it's silly it's a dude sweating alright so if our temperature is greater than thirty we will display a message it is hot outside so what if we want to check something else too before actually using an else statement well we can use an else if statement it's kind of like if our if statement turns out to be false we can check one more thing or a few more things before we result to the else statement so let me give you an example let's check to see if our temperature is less than zero so I think that's the freezing point in Celsius let's display a message that says C out it is cold outside BRR and then let's have an else statement actually no what I think I'm gonna change this to greater than or equal to 30 and than or equal to zero all right so let's add an else statement so basically if our temperature is not greater than 30 greater than or equal to 30 and our temperature is not less than or equal to zero it's going to fall within a certain range of 1 to 29 degrees Celsius so anything that falls within that range we could say it is perhaps warm outside it is warm outside ok let's test out this program ok please enter the temperature it is 50 degrees Celsius outside it is hot outside let's try a different answer please enter the temperature perhaps negative 20 degrees Celsius it is cold outside now if our temperature falls within a certain range that's basically how we set this up it's going to just rely on the else statement because it's checking one if statement after another first it checks to see if our temperature is greater than or equal to 30 and if it's false we're going to use the elsif statement and it's going to check to see if our temperature is less than or equal to zero if that's also false then we resort to the else statement and that's kind of like a last resort so if it's not hot outside and it's not cold outside then it must be warm outside so let's try this one last time just to verify if that's true so please enter the temperature perhaps 25 degrees Celsius it is warm outside well that's the fundamentals of if statements it's a basic form of decision-making we can check to see if some condition that we specify is true then we can have our program do something if it's false we can have our program do nothing or something else entirely all include copies of the programs that we made in this video and I'll post it as a comment down below and pin it to the top but yeah that is everything you need to know to get started using if statements in C++ hey you if you and this lesson then you can help
