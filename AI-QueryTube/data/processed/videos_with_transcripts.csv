Vtckgz38QHs,Learn Quick Sort in 13 minutes ⚡,2021-08-13 14:11:31+00:00,hey uh it's you bro hope you're doing well and in this video i'm going to explain the quicksort algorithm in computer science yep so uh sit back relax and enjoy the show all right quick sort here's how quick sort is going to work we need an array or some other type of collection i have a simple unordered array what we do is that we'll pass our array as an argument into a quick sort function after passing our array as an argument to the quick sort function we need to pick a pivot there's different variations of quick sort we can either pick a pivot at the beginning the middle or at the end but with most standard quick sort algorithms we will set the pivot to be at the end of our array what we're trying to accomplish is that we need to find the final resting place of our pivot where is this value going to be and taking a look at this that would be right about here but we don't know that yet so to find the final resting place of this value our pivot here's what we can do we will declare and use two indices j and i j will begin at the start of our array i will be one less than the beginning of our array and that's going to be important later and we'll need the help of a temporary variable so we can swap some values all we're doing is checking to see if the value at j is less than our pivot if it's greater than our pivot or equal to our pivot we ignore it eight is greater than five we ignore this value and then increment j by one so during that last iteration i did not come into play yet but it will this round again we check to see if this value is less than our pivot which it is what we do now is increment i then what comes next is that we swap these two values i and j and we'll need the help of a temporary variable so take the value at i assign it to temp take the value at j assign it to i take the value within temp assign it to j then we can move on to the next iteration increments j we check to see if the value at j is less than our pivot which it is if that is the case we increment i swap these two values we'll repeat this process until j reaches our pivot then we can move on to the next step this here's the next step after our index j reaches our pivot we now know where the final resting place of our pivot is gonna be it's i incremented by one so we will increment i then swap the value at index of i with the value at our pivot our pivot is now within the correct place an easy way to tell is that all elements to the left of our pivot should be at less than our pivot but they're not necessarily going to be in order and that's fine they'll be organized later all elements to the right of our pivot should be greater than or equal to our pivot and like i said before they probably will not be in order the important thing is that elements to the left should be less than our pivot elements to the right should be greater than that's how we know the pivot's in the correct place now the next step we're going to create two sections two partitions the first partition will be all the elements from the beginning of our array up until our pivot but not including the pivot and our second partition will be all the elements after our pivot until the end of our array quicksort is a recursive algorithm we need to pass these partitions as arguments into the quick sort function remember that the quick sort algorithm is a recursive divide and conquer algorithm but unlike with merge sort with merge sort we create new subarrays with quick sort we will be sorting these arrays in place but we need to keep track of the beginning and ending indices of these partitions and then it's just a matter of repeating the same steps over again but we're going to instead use these partitions sections of our array i'll give you a quick demonstration of what the quicksort algorithm is going to look like to completion [Music] [Music] and that ladies and gentlemen was your visual representation of the quicksort algorithm let's code our own quick sort algorithm just to solidify our understanding of this topic all right people let's create a quick sort function you'll need an array to work with place some random numbers within that array and then some way to iterate and display the elements of your array i'm just using a symbol for each loop so after running this of course our array is not yet sorted so before we display the elements of our array let's invoke a quick sort function which we still need to declare defined there will be three arguments our array and the beginning and ending indices of our array so that would be zero for the beginning then to find the ending you can just say array dot length minus one let's declare this function private static void quick sort and let's rename some of these parameters we have our array of integers named array and this will be the starting index and this parameter will be the ending index so we have indices start and end now the base case this will use recursion will be if end is less than or equal to start then we will return and this is our base case eventually we won't be able to divide our array any further so that's when we stop and return with our quick sort function we'll need the assistance of a helper function that we will name partition let's copy our function declaration paste it and make a few changes so this will return an int the location of our pivot and the function name will be partition and the parameters are the same at the end of our partition helper function we'll return i i will be the location of our pivot but we'll get to that later okay so within our quick sort function we'll need to find the location of where to pivot int pivot and the partition function will be in charge of that partition is going to sort our array and find the pivot so all elements to the left will be smaller than our pivot all elements to the right will be larger so pass in our array we're sorting our array in place there's no need to create any sub-arrays we'll just pass in our original array as well as the start and end after we figure out where our pivot's going to be we can pass in each partition recursively back into the quick sort function so again we will invoke quick sort pass in our array the start of our left partition and the ending of our left partition and that is where pivot is minus one we do not want to include our pivot and then we will need to use quick sort on the right partition change start to pivot plus one because the pivot is already in place and then the end of our array in this variation of the quick sort function we will say that pivot is at the end it will always be at the end to begin with int pivot equals array at index of n we'll need two indices i and j we'll create index i equals start minus one and then we will iterate through our array and this is where we will declare int j our second index int j equals start and we will continue this for loop as long as j is less than or equal to the end of our array minus one then increment j by one what we're going to check is if array at index of j is less than our pivot if one of these elements is less than our pivot we want it on the left hand side of our pivot any numbers larger than our pivot should be on the right hand side so we will increment i by 1 and do a basic variable swap and we'll need the help of a temporary variable int temp equals array at index of i array at index of i equals array at index of j lastly array at index of j equals temp this is just a basic variable swap once all elements that are less than our pivot are on the left hand side and all elements that are larger than our pivot are on the right hand side what we will do now is increment i by one and then insert our pivot into its final resting place with another basic variable swap so let's copy this code then paste it and make a few changes intent equals array at index of i that's the same array at index of i equals array at index of end array at index event equals temp and that's it and then make sure you return i at the end that is the location of our pivot then after running this our array is now sorted via the quick sort algorithm in conclusion the quick sort algorithm moves smaller elements to the left of a pivot we recursively divide our array into two partitions and pass those partitions as arguments recursively into the quick sort function the runtime complexity of the quicksort algorithm actually varies in its best and average cases it runs in big o of n log n however in its worst case it can run in big o of n squared this is rare and it occurs if the array is already sorted or close to being sorted but most of the time it will run in big o of n log n and the space complexity of the quicksort algorithm is big o of log n this is due to recursion it uses more space than bubble sort selection sort and insertion sort even though it sorts in place that's because the quick sort algorithm uses recursion we're adding frames to the call stack which takes memory so yeah that is the quick sort algorithm if you found this video helpful please be sure to

iLZOL-hmr7M,C format specifiers 🔧,2021-08-15 15:27:58+00:00,all right welcome back everybody in this video i'm going to show you while a few extra things that we can do with format specifiers using a format specifier within a printf statement we can define and format a type of data to be displayed to use a format specifier you use a percent sign then follow that percent sign with a certain character depending on the type of data you would like to display let's say that we have three variables maybe we have an online store or something like that so let's say that these are of the float data type and we'll have three items for sale item one and make up some price let's say that the first item is five dollars and seventy five cents and we have item two and this will be ten dollars even and then we have item three and this will be one hundred dollars and ninety nine cents so let's display item one item two and item three with a printf statement printf and within a string let's say item one colon space then i'll add a dollar sign wherever you would like to insert a value or variable you will use that format specifier the percent sign so after my dollar sign i'll add item one so that would be percent then for floats you need f and then after the string add comma item one then let's just make sure that this works so we're going to be formatting this output what if we don't want all the zeros we can set the decimal precision of a float or double after the format specifier add a dot and the amount of digits you would like to display if i would only like to display two digits after the percent i will add point two and this will only display two digits for the amount of cents that we owe okay now let's do the same thing for items two and three so item two item two item three item three okay then let's add a new line character because i forgot so new line new line and new line much better another thing that we can do with format specifiers is that we can set a minimum field width so just add a number after the percent sign let's say that i would like to allocate eight spaces worth of room to display my number so after the percent sign but before the decimal add how many spaces you would like to set for the minimum field width let's say eight and let's see the new output okay there we go however it's all right aligned if you would like this left aligned you would use a negative sign after the percent to left align all this this would be negative whatever number you would like to allocate so the number is left justified but we still have all of this room after so that's what a format specifier is it defines and formats a type of data to be displayed so place a format specifier within a string use a certain character for the type of data you would like to display you can set decimal precision for floats and doubles you can set a minimum field width to display your output if you would like to line things up like you can see here and you can left or right align your output so yeah those are format specifiers if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
Hh_se2Zqsdk,Learn HTML images in 3 minutes 📷,2021-08-15 15:28:16+00:00,all right people here's how to add an image to a webpage find or download an image of your choosing i just so happen to have a picture of shrek within your folder containing your index.html file you're going to move or paste that image within the same folder and within the body element we're going to create a new element an image element within angle brackets type img for image this is a self closing tag and many elements have different attributes that we can change we need to change the source attribute of this image element the source attribute is src and we will set this equal to within double quotes the name of our image mine is shrek.png and then save what i like to do if i'm working with a webpage that has a lot of images i like to create a separate folder for my images this isn't necessary but if your image is located within a separate folder we need to find the file path relative to your index.html file so i'm going to create a new folder and let's name this images it will contain all the images from my webpage then i will move my image to my images folder so we can no longer locate this image we need to find the file path relative to the index.html file to look within my images folder i will precede the image name with forward slash the name of the folder images slash the name of the image and there it is personally if i'm working with a lot of images i like to place all of my images within one folder if you decide to do that as well you just need to precede the file name with the name of the folder that it's in here's my image but it's fairly massive we can change the width and height attributes if we need to i will change the height attribute height equals maybe 200 and that's a lot smaller hm maybe 300 that's a little bit better the height and the width will scale proportionately with each other but you can change them individually let's change the width width equals let's say 100 what we get is an extra skinny shrek and if i change this to maybe 600 well shrek is extra thick now so i will just only change the height attribute so that the width attribute scales proportionately now if somebody is visually impaired they may be using a screen reader to navigate a web page it would be good practice to add some alternative text that is read out loud by a screen reader so that is the alt attribute within double quotes i'll type a brief description of this image this is a picture of shrek so when you add an image it's considered good practice to add some alternative text you can also add a title too a title will be a small pop-up box that appears when you hover your cursor over an image to add a title set the title attribute equal to some text shrek is shrek see and then i'm going to save hover my cursor over the image and we can see a small pop-up box that has my title shrek is shrek see we can also turn an image into a hyperlink to turn this image into a hyperlink we need to surround our image element with an opening and closing a tag so open and close within the opening a tag there is an href attribute that we can set to a url of our choosing i think i'll set this hyperlink to the wikipedia page for shrek so just type in the url between these double quotes save then if i were to click on my image this will take me to the wikipedia page for shrek or some other url depending on what you type here so yeah that's how to add an image to a webpage within the body element you need to add an image element and then set the source equal to the image name if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
9E3I1URu6fc,C arithmetic operators ➗,2021-08-19 15:00:33+00:00,well well well welcome back so we need to talk about arithmetic operators because well this wouldn't be a full course without them so as you probably know arithmetic operators are well addition subtraction multiplication division and there's a few others too unique with programming such as modulus increment and decrement so let's go over a few let's say that we have int z and if we need to add two numbers we could say x plus y equals z and then display the sum which of course is seven so subtraction is well minus five minus two is three multiplication is an asterisk five times two equals ten okay now pay attention to this with division so 5 divided by 2 equals 2.5 right well that's where you're wrong it's 2 because we're storing the results within an integer and with integers we can only store whole numbers so we will lose that decimal portion it will be truncated there's a few things we'll need to change first we'll need to store the result within a float or a double and then let's display this percent f for a float okay another thing that we need to change too and that involves integer division if we're dividing by an integer we'll truncate that decimal portion there's one of two things we can do we can either change our divisor to a float or a double and that will solve that problem 2.5 or if we would like to keep this as an integer we can convert this integer to a float or double by preceding the divisor with float or double either one so if i would like to keep y as an integer and we divide x by y we will convert 2 into a float so 2.0 and store the result within float z and the result is 2.5 so if you're performing division with any integers you need to pay attention to integer division and you may need to cast your divisor as a float or as a double now we have modulus modulus gives you the remainder of any division five does not divide by two evenly int z equals x modulus y and if we display z so make sure to change your format specifier if you didn't the remainder of five divided by two is one if this was four four divides by two evenly and the result is going to be zero modulus gives you the remainder of any division it's actually pretty helpful to find if a number is even odd all you do is say modulus 2 or some variable containing the value of 2 either way and then we can increment or decrement a number by 1. if i need to increment x for some reason you'll see this when we get to the video on loops i could say x plus plus and then let's display x x incremented by one would be six and then let's decrement y y minus minus and y decremented by one equals one so yeah everybody those are a few arithmetic operators a lot of these are fairly simple you know addition subtraction multiplication and division do pay attention to integer division because that can throw off your program then there's also modulus increment and decrement if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
SZfoOAv9tEo,Learn HTML text formatting in 2 minutes 💬,2021-08-21 15:06:21+00:00,all right welcome back everybody so in this video i'm going to show you all a few useful text formatting tags that you may be interested in we'll need some sample text to work with this is normal text we'll create additional lines of text so i'm going to surround this text with a pair of paragraph tags just so that when we add additional text they will be added to a new line let's copy this line and paste it nine additional times let's say there we go first set of text formatting tags that i'll show you is bold any text that you need to bold just surround that text with a pair of beat tags we need an opening b tag and a closing beats egg this is normal text and you can see that the word normal is bold uh let's change that to bold just so that it's more descriptive of what it does okay so any text you need bold just surround with a pair of b tags the next set of tags is italic surround any text that you need italic with a pair of eye tags this is italic text we have big this is big text we have small this is small text sub for subscript this is subscript text superscript the tag name is sup like you're saying sup to somebody this is superscript text we have inserted inserted is just underlined ins for inserted this is inserted text there is deleted deleted will create a line through some text this is deleted text and there's one more it looks like i miscounted there's also marked so we use a pair of mark tags any text that is marked is highlighted so yeah those are a few text formatting tags that i thought you should know if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
-kXZvKxs9oA,Learn HTML lists in 4 minutes 📋,2021-08-21 15:23:45+00:00,hey welcome back in this video i'm going to show you all how we can create lists in html there's three lists we're going to talk about unordered ordered and description lists let's begin with unordered lists to create an unordered list we need a pair of ul tags for an unordered list and between these ul tags we can create individual list items and we use a pair of li tags for each item we would like to add to our list so what's an example of an unordered list one thing that comes to mind is a shopping list like a grocery list because well i'm kind of hungry right now it's breakfast time let's say that we're going to bake a pizza and we need a list of ingredients we need pizza dough so add an item between this pair of li tags and we now have one bulleted item within our unordered list and let's create another item so we can just copy and paste this pair of li tags and create a new list item what about tomato sauce and then maybe cheese and toppings point being to create an unordered list you need a pair of ul tags and with each list item you would like to add to your unordered list you just place within a pair of li tags for list item an ordered list is very similar except we use old tags so we need an opening ol tag and a closing ol tag so by default each list item is going to be numbered so let's say that we have a to-do list to add a list item we need to use a pair of li tags perhaps this is a schedule of what we have to do in the morning we have to eat breakfast that could be one list item so to add another item we need another pair of li tags then maybe we need to take a shower so each of these is numbered and they're in ascending order and then we want to what about leave for work okay so yeah that is an ordered list the order of the list items does matter and we can change the type too within the opening oel tag there is a type attribute we can set each list item to a number a letter or roman numerals if i would instead like letters i can just set the type equal to a and our list items are now marked with the letter and we have description lists we need a pair of dl tags for description lists and instead of using an li tag for each list item we use a pair of dt tags for description term and d tags for description definition so for a term that is d t and then we add a definition to this term let's say we have a list of web dev languages for a term we need an opening dt tag and a closing dt tag and then we can add a definition to this term so that would be dd description definition between the opening and closing dd tags we can add a definition to this term let's say that this adds structure to a web page and then to create another term and definition pair we can just copy this let's add css this adds style to a web page then javascript this adds functionality to a web page with description lists each list item is a pair of terms and definitions the last thing i'm going to show you you can create a nested list within a list so let's say i would like to add a sub list of individual toppings to our unordered list within the list item we just create a new list let's say that i would like another unordered list so i need a pair of ul tags and what are some toppings we can place on our pizza so we need a list item what about pepperoni so we have a sub list going if you take a look on the webpage right now ah then maybe what about mushrooms next i like mushrooms and peppers i guess all right people those are how to create lists there's three types unordered ordered and description lists just use a pair of appropriate tags depending on the list you want to use so yeah everybody that's how to create different lists in html if you found this video helpful please remember to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro
REtiFfgj8SU,C circle circumference program ⚪,2021-08-27 15:11:56+00:00,hey everyone here's a quick program that we can make to calculate the circumference of a circle i thought this would be good practice for us now that we know how user input works let's declare all of the variables that we'll need i'm going to create a constant variable named pi and it's going to be of the double data type pi equals 3.14159 the reason that i'm making this a constant is that i don't want anybody else to be able to change the value of pi and let's declare but not assign a radius quite yet we'll have the user type that in and double circumference this will be calculated and displayed so we will need to prompt the user to enter in a radius i'll proceed this with a new line enter radius of a circle and then i will use scanf to accept some user input we need to list the format specifier of doubles which is lf comma address of operator radius then the formula for radius is 2 times pi times radius and then we will display our circumference using printf circumference then we need a format specifier we're displaying a double so the format specifier is lf comma circumference and let's run it enter well the radius of a circle uh let's say that our radius is 10 maybe this is 10 i don't know meters all right our circumference is 62.83 meters now why not take this a step further let's also calculate the area of the circle i wasn't planning on taking it this far but hey let's calculate that as well for practice so let's declare a double variable named area and we will calculate what areas the formula for the area of the circle is pi times radius squared pi times radius times radius then let's display the area so area we're using the double format specifier and area then let's add some new line characters to separate everything enter the radius of a circle let's say 10 meters the circumference is 62.83 meters and the area is 314.15 meters all right everybody that is a small program to calculate the circumference of a circle and i guess the area as well just because well why not so yeah if you found this video helpful please be sure to smash that like button leave a random comment down below and subscribe if you'd like to become a fellow bro

6IQz_cF-Slk,Learn HTML colors in 3 minutes 🖍️,2021-09-01 12:49:24+00:00,"Hey. Uh, what's going on everybody? In this video, I'm going to show you how we can add color to a web page. So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. All right. Now, here's how we can add color to a web page. We'll be talking a little bit about CSS, but we'll cover this more in depth in the CSS series. I thought this would be a good place for us to introduce colors because we'll be able to color things like buttons and forms and whatnot. Here's how to add some color to a web page. Within the opening tag of an element of your choosing, there is a style attribute. And within double quotes, we can add CSS properties. For my website, I would like to change the background color to black because I think it would look cool. So, within double quotes, list the CSS property you would like to change, background color. After the colon, you can either add a color name, RGB values, or hexadimal values. Let's just say the color black. There we go. We can no longer see my website. Let's change the font color of these individual H1 header tags. Again, it's the same process as before. Style equals within double quotes list the CSS property you would like to add. I would like to add color this time to change the font color. And I will pick red. There we go. This time let's use RGB values. So again, style attribute equals the CSS property you would like to change. To instead use an RGB value, type RGB parenthesis. Then I would recommend looking up a color picker and you can pick a color of whatever you would like. Uh what about blue? Perhaps that shade of blue. So RGB values are in a group of three, a triad. So I will copy these three numbers and paste them within the parenthesis of RGB. And this second H1 header tag is now that specific shade of blue. I tend to prefer to use RGB values or hexodimal values over color names because you have more variety. Now let's use hexodimal values. Style equals the CSS property of color. So hexodimal values always start with a hashtag. What about green? So, we'll have red, blue, and green. And I will copy this number. They are in groups of six. And well, yeah, it's green now. Cool, right? Okay. Now, let's change both the font color and the background color of this paragraph. Within the opening tag of this paragraph element, we will set the style attribute equal to any CSS properties within double quotes. Let's change the background color first. background dash color space. I'll set this to dark gray which is 2 two2 222. Then to add multiple CSS properties, separate each with a semicolon. And this time I will change just the color and I'll use the same shade of green. All right. Well, there we go. So yeah, everybody, that's how to add some colors to your web page. There's more advanced things we can do when we reach the video series on CSS, but what you can do for now within the opening tag of an element of your choosing, set the style attribute equal to whatever CSS properties you would like to add within quotes. So yeah, that's how to add color to a web page.

yHX-UwAnoqk,Learn HTML span &amp; div in 2 minutes 🏁,2021-09-01 12:49:52+00:00,hey welcome back in this video i'm going to explain the span and div tags let's begin with span span adds markup to text or portion of a document anything that i surround with a pair of spam tags i can apply markup or some effect too so in my example document i have a header and three paragraphs what if i would like this specific sentence to be i don't know red well what i could do is surround this sentence in my document with a pair of spam tags so i need an opening spam tag and a closing spam tag and that sentence ends right here and within the span tag i can change some of the attributes of this sentence um so i would like to change maybe the style i'll set the style color equal to red now you probably do want this closing tag if you do not have this closing tag your span will take up this entire section so basically that's what span is it adds markup to text or a portion of a document div is very similar except it divides a division of a document so what if i would like to change the background color of these three paragraphs well what we learned in the last video on colors is that we could set the style background color equal to some shade of gray maybe this value this does work and i could just copy this and paste it for each of these paragraphs or another way of doing this is that i can surround these three paragraphs with a pair of div tags so we need an opening div tag and a closing div tag and then i will apply this style attribute to the opening div tag and it will apply this attribute to anything between these div tags so yeah that's basically what the span and div tags do span adds markup to text or portion of a document div defines a division of a document so yeah that's span and div in html
