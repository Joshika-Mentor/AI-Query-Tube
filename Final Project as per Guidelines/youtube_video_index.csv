WJ8iTQpNxZA,Spherical Coordinate System Explained | Electromagnetic Theory,2026-01-04 05:06:29+00:00,2026,1,Sunday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in the previous video, we understood the importance of the different coordinate systems while learning this electromagnetic theory. And in that video, we also understood about the cylindrical coordinate system. So similarly, in this video, let us learn about the spherical coordinate system. So first, let us understand what are the coordinates in the spherical coordinate system. So in the spherical coordinate system, we have the three coordinates. That is the rθ and the 5. So here, if you see this r, then it is the radial distance from the origin. So if you just want to visualize it, then just draw a sphere from the origin. So here, this r represents the radius of this sphere. So here, this r can vary from 0 to infinity. So we can say that the range of this coordinate r is from 0 to infinity. Similarly, the next coordinate is the angle θ. So here, this θ represents the polar angle. So this θ is the angle that is made by this radius with the z-axis. And likewise, this φ is the azimuth angle. So this angle is same as the angle that we have seen in the cylindrical coordinate system. So if we take the projection of this r on the x-y plane and draw a line from the origin, then that represents the ρ. So this φ is the angle between the ρ and the x-axis. So in this way, this θ is the polar angle and the φ is the azimuth angle. So here, this φ is varying in the x-y plane, while this θ is varying in this plane. So here, if you see the range of the θ, then it is varying from 0 to π. So here, when the θ is 0, then the r will be parallel to the z-axis. And whenever it is equal to π, then the r will be in the opposite direction. That means here, the range of the θ is from 0 to π. Likewise, if you see this azimuth angle, then it is varying from 0 to 2π. That means this is the range of the coordinates r, θ and the φ. So in this way, if we have been given some point in the 3D space, then we can find its r, θ and the φ coordinates. That means from the origin, if we draw a line towards the point P, then that radial distance corresponds to r. And if we see the angle between the r and the z, then that corresponds to θ. And from that point P, if we take the projection on the x-y plane and connect the intersection point to the origin, then the angle between the x-axis and the ρ represents the φ. And in this way, we can find these coordinates r, θ and the φ. So now, let's see, if we have been given this point P in the spherical coordinate system, then how to represent the same point in the Cartesian coordinate system. And then after, we will also see the other way around. So for this spherical to Cartesian conversion, let's say, we have some point P in the 3D space, and its coordinates are r, θ and the φ. So here, if we take the projection of this radius r on the z-axis, then we will get the z component. So we can say that, here the z is equal to r cos θ, right. Similarly, if you see the ρ, that is the projection of the r on the x-y plane, then that corresponds to r sin θ. So the same thing, if you see in this plane, then you will be able to visualize it better. So here, this z corresponds to r cos θ, while this ρ corresponds to r sin θ. And now, if we take the projection of this ρ on the x-axis, then we can say that, here this x corresponds to ρ cos φ. And likewise, if we take the projection of the ρ on the y-axis, then we will get the y component, that is equal to ρ sin φ. And we already know that, this ρ is equal to r sin θ. So we can say that, here this x is equal to r sin θ cos φ, while the y is equal to r sin θ sin φ. So in this way, we got the coordinates x, y and z in terms of the coordinates r, θ and the φ. So using this expression, we can convert any spherical coordinates into the Cartesian coordinates. So similarly, now let's see the other way around, and let's find out, suppose we have been given the coordinates in the Cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert it into the spherical coordinate system. So here, we already know these expressions, right? So here, let's perform the x² plus y² plus z². So if we do so, then we will get this r² sin²θ sin²φ plus r² sin²θ cos²5. And for the z², we will get the r² cos²θ. So in the first two terms, if you see, then here, this r² sin²θ is common. So if we take it out, then we will have this sin²φ plus cos²φ. And as you know, that is equal to 1. That means we will have this r² sin²θ plus r² cos²θ. So once again, if we take the r² common, then we will have this sin²θ plus cos²θ. And once again, as you know, that is equal to 1. So we can say that this x² plus y² plus z² corresponds to r². Or we can say that this r is equal to square root of x² plus y² plus z². So similarly, now let's find the expression of θ and φ in terms of x, y and z. So here, to find the azimuth angle φ, let's take the ratio of y and x. So if we take the ratio of y and x, then this r sinθ will get cancelled out from the numerator as well as the denominator. And after that, we will have this sinφ divided by cos5. And that is equal to tan5. So we can say that here this φ is equal to tan-inverse y divided by x. So in this way, we also got the expression of the φ in terms of the y and the x. So similarly, now let's also find the expression of the θ. So as you can see over here, this z is equal to rcosθ. And the same thing, we have also seen earlier. So from this, we can say that here this θ is equal to cos-inverse z divided by r. And we already know that this r is equal to square root of x² plus y² plus z². So in this way, we also got the expression of the θ in terms of the x, y and the z. So in this way, we found the relationship between the rθ and the φ in terms of the x, y and the z. That means using these expressions, suppose we have been given coordinates in the spherical coordinate system, then we can find the equivalent coordinates in the Cartesian coordinate system. And likewise, using this expression, we can find the other way around. So now, similar to the coordinate conversion, let's see the vector conversion. But before that, first let's see the direction of the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. So let's say, there is some point P in the spherical coordinate system. So if we draw a vector from the origin to this point, then that will represent the position vector. So in general, any vector in the spherical coordinate system can be represented like this. So here, this capital A rAθ and A5 are the components of the vector. And likewise, this small a rAθ and A5 are the unit vectors in the direction of rθ and the φ. So as I said in the previous video, the spherical and the cylindrical coordinate systems are the curvilinear coordinate system. That means here, the direction of the unit vector will not remain fixed. And rather, it will change with the position of the vector. So in this case, let's see, at the given point, what will be the direction of the unit vectors a rAθ and the A5. So in any curvilinear coordinate system, the direction of the unit vector will always be in the increasing direction of the coordinates. So here also, these unit vectors a rAθ and the A5 will always point in the increasing direction of this rθ and the φ. So here, at the given point, if you see, then the r is increasing in this direction. That means here, this will be the direction of the unit vector a r. Likewise, if you see the azimuth angle φ, then it is varying from 0 to 2π in the xy plane. That means here, at the given point P, the a5 will point in this direction. And likewise, if you see the angle θ, then it is changing in this direction. That means here, at the given point P, this aθ will point in the downward direction. So the same thing you will be able to visualize it better, if I just take the slice of this sphere. So now, if you see over here, then this is the direction of the a rAθ and the a5 at the given point. And as you can see over here, all the three unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. Or in other words, they are the orthogonal to each other. And since they are the orthogonal, so their dot product will be equal to zero. That means here we can say that this a r.aθ, a r.a5, as well as the aθ.a5 will be equal to zero. And likewise, if we perform the cross product between these unit vectors in the cyclic form, then we will get the another unit vector. For example, here this a r cross aθ will be equal to a5. Likewise, this aθ cross a5 will give us the a r. And likewise, the cross product of the unit vectors a5 and a r will give us the unit vector aθ. And suppose, if we reverse the order of this cross product, then we will get the negative sign before the result. For example, here if we perform the aθ cross a r, then we will get the minus a5. So in this way, here this a r, aθ and a5 are the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. So now, let us see the vector conversion between the spherical and the Cartesian coordinate system. And we will also see the other way around. That means suppose, we have been given a vector in the spherical coordinate system, then how to convert it into the Cartesian coordinate system. And then after, we will also see the other way around. So here, like we have done in case of the cylindrical coordinate system, we will derive the transformation matrix. And with the help of it, we can find the vector in the another coordinate system. So here, instead of just writing this transformation matrix, we will also derive it. And as a first step in the derivation, let us find the unit vector conversion between the two coordinate systems. That means here, first we will see that, if we have been given a unit vector in the Cartesian coordinate system, then with the help of it, how we can find the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. And then after, we will see the other way around. And once we find the relationship between these unit vectors, then with the help of it, we will find the relationship between these coefficients ax, ay, az and the a r, aθ and the a5. So as a first step, let us see the unit vector conversion between the Cartesian and the spherical coordinate system. So to derive these expressions, once again let's say, there is some point P in the 3D space. And let's say, its coordinates is equal to x, y and z. So now, from the origin, if we draw a vector connecting to this point, then that will represent the position vector. Let's say, that is equal to P. So we know that, in general, in the Cartesian coordinate system, this vector P can be given as, this ax times ax, plus ay times ay, plus az times az. But here, since it is the position vector, so the value of these components ax, ay and az will be same as the coordinate values x, y and z. Let me see here, in this Cartesian coordinate, this vector P can also be written as, this This x times ax, plus y times ay, plus z times az. So here if you see, then our aim is to find this ar, aθ and a5, right. But if you see this expression, then this expression does not contain any variables such as rθ and φ. So here, what we will do, we will represent this x, y and z in terms of the rθ and φ. And for that, we already know this relationship, right. So here, specifically we can use this expression, because P is the position vector. And due to that, here this x, y and z represents the coordinate values. So basically, here we are applying the coordinate conversion. So after this conversion, this is how the P can be represented. So basically, here we have put the values of x, y and z in terms of the rθ and φ. So here, if we differentiate this vector P with respect to r, or if we perform the del P divided by del r, then we will get the vector that is increasing in the direction of the r. And if we normalize it, then we will get the unit vector ar. So to find this unit vector ar, first let us perform this del P divided by del r. That means here, we will differentiate this vector P with respect to r. So if we do so, then we will get this sinθcosφax, plus sinθsinφay, plus cosθaz. And if we take its magnitude, then we will get square root of sinθcosφ, plus sinθsin square phi, plus cosθ. So here, in the first two terms, this sinθ is common. So if we take it outside, then in the bracket, we will have cos2phi, plus sin2phi. And we know that, that is equal to 1. That means after the further simplification, once again, we will have square root of sin2θ, plus cos2θ. And once again, that is also equal to 1. So we can say that, here the unit vector ar can be given by this expression. So similarly, now let's find the unit vector aθ. So this unit vector aθ is equal to ∂P divided by ∂θ divided by its magnitude. So here, to perform this ∂P divided by ∂θ, we will differentiate this vector P with respect to θ. So if we do so, then we will get this rcosθcosφax, plus rcosθsinφay. And for the third term, we will get this minus rsinθ. So similarly, now let's also find its magnitude. So its magnitude can be given as, square root of rcosθcos5, plus rcosθsin5. And likewise for the third term, we will have this rsinθ. So once again, here this rcosθ is common in the first two terms. So if we take that outside, then in the bracket, we will have this cos5, plus sin5. And we know that, that is equal to 1. Then once again, this r2sin2θ, plus r2cos2θ will become r2. That means the square root of the r2 will be equal to r. So in this way, the magnitude of this ∂P divided by ∂θ is equal to r. So now, to get this unit vector aθ, we need to divide this expression by the r. That means here, this aθ is equal to cosθcos5ax, plus cosθsin5ay, minus sinθaz. So in this way, we also got the expression of the unit vector aθ in terms of the axay and the az. And likewise, now let's also find the unit vector a5. So once again, here this unit vector a5 can be given as, this ∂P divided by ∂5, divided by its magnitude. So here, to find this ∂P divided by ∂5, we will differentiate this vector P with respect to 5. And if we do so, then we will get, minus rsinθsin5ax, plus rsinθcos5ay, because the differentiation of the sin5 is equal to cos5. And for the third term, as it does not contain any variable 5, so its differentiation with respect to 5 will be equal to 0. That means here, this will be the expression of ∂P divided by ∂5. So similarly, now let's also find its magnitude. So here, the magnitude of this ∂P divided by ∂5 is equal to √rsinθsin5, plus rsinθcos5. So once again, in the first two terms, this rsinθ is common. So if we take it outside, then in the bracket, we will have this sin5 plus cos5. And once again, that will be equal to 1. That means now, we will have this √rsinθ, and that is equal to rsinθ. So we can say that, here this unit vector a5 is equal to ∂P divided by ∂5, divided by rsinθ. And that is equal to, minus sin5 times ax, plus cos5 times ay. So in this way, we got the expression of the unit vectors ar, aθ and a5, in terms of the unit vectors ax, ay and az. So similarly, now let's see the other way around, and let's find the relationship between this ax, ay and az, in terms of the ar, aθ and the a5. So here, since we already know this relationship, so for finding that, we will use the bracket projection method. That means if you see any vector, then it can be represented as the linear combination of the unit vectors ar, aθ and the a5. So here, we can represent this ax like this, because here this ar, aθ and a5 are forming the orthonormal base. That means here, first, these three unit vectors are orthogonal to each other, and if you see their magnitude, then that is also equal to 1. So because of that, any vector can be represented like this. That is the combination of the ar, aθ and the a5. And here, if you see this cr, cθ and the c5, then they are the projection of the unit vectors ar, aθ and the a5 in the ax direction. That means here, if you see this cr, then that is equal to this ar.ax, or in other words, that is equal to ax.ar. And as you can see, here the dot product of the unit vectors ax and ar represent the projection of the unit vector ar in the x direction. So here, since we already know this relationship, so we can easily find this ax.ar. And if we perform the dot product of this ax and ar, then we will get this first term. Because the second and the third term will become zero. Because as we know, this ax.ay is zero, and likewise, this ax.az will also become zero. That means this ax.ar will come out as sinθcos5. Likewise, this cθ will be equal to ax.aθ, and that will come out as cosθcos5. And similarly, this c5 is equal to minus sin5. So from this, we can say that here this unit vector ax is equal to sinθcos5 times ar plus cosθcos5 times aθ, and the third term will be equal to minus sin5 times a5. So in this way, we got the expression of the unit vector ax in terms of the ar, aθ and the a5. So similarly, now let's find the unit vectors ay and the az. So similar to the unit vector ax, this ay can also be given as, this cr times ar plus cθ times aθ plus c5 times a5. And once again, here this coefficient cr represents the projection of the unit vector ar in the direction of the ay. That means here, this cr is equal to ay.ar. And here, since we already know this relationship, so we can easily find this ay.ar. That means here, this ay.ar will be equal to sinθsin5. Likewise, if you see the cθ, then that will be equal to cosθsin5. And similarly, this c5 will be equal to ay.a5 and that is equal to cos5. So we can say that, this ay is equal to sinθsin5 times ar plus cosθsin5 times aθ. And the third term will be equal to cos5 times a5. So similarly, now let's also find the az. So here, once again this az can be given by this expression. And here, this cr will be equal to az.ar. So here, if we perform this az.ar with this expression, then we will get this last term. That is equal to cosθ. Likewise, this cθ will be equal to az.aθ. And in this case, it will come out as minus sinθ. And similarly, this c5 is equal to az.a5. So in this case, that will be equal to zero. That means here, this az will be equal to cosθ times ar minus sinθ times aθ. So in this way, we got the unit vectors ax, ay and az in terms of the ar, aθ and a5. And earlier, we already found the spherical coordinate unit vectors in terms of the Cartesian coordinate unit vectors. So now, with the help of it, we can easily find the relationship between the coefficients of the Cartesian coordinate and the spherical coordinates. And with the help of it, we can easily perform the vector conversion. So first, let's see the spherical to Cartesian vector conversion. That means here, we already have a vector in the spherical coordinate system. So here, what we will do, we will put the values of ar, aθ and a5 in the given expression. So here, if we put the value of ar, then we will get this term. So again, if you want to follow with me, then you can pause the video and you can check it by yourself. Similarly, if we put the value of aθ, then we will get this second term. And likewise, by putting the value of a5, we will get the third term. So now, in this entire expression, let's combine the terms related to the ax, ay and the az. So now, if we combine the terms related to the ax, then we will get these three terms. Similarly, if we combine the terms related to the ay, then we will get these three terms. And likewise, let's also combine the terms related to the az. So now, if we compare this expression with the general expression of the Cartesian coordinate vector, then here we can say that this term corresponds to ax. Likewise, this ay corresponds to second term and this az corresponds to third term. So from this, we can say that here this ax is equal to ar sinθcos5 plus aθcosθcos5 and the third term will be equal to minus a5 times sin5. And likewise, we can also find the ay and the az. So in this way, we found the components ax, ay and az in terms of the components ar, aθ and the a5. So here, the same thing can also be represented in the matrix form. So this is the transformation matrix for converting any vector from the spherical coordinate system to the Cartesian coordinate system. And in the last video, we have seen that if we just take the transpose of this matrix, then we can also find the conversion matrix for the Cartesian to spherical vector conversion. That means here, we just need to change the rows into the column. And now, this matrix is the transformation matrix for the Cartesian to spherical vector conversion. That means here, we just need to remember only one conversion matrix. And with the help of the transpose, we can find another one. So in this way, with the help of this conversion matrix, we can convert any vector from the Cartesian to the spherical coordinate system as well as from the spherical to the Cartesian coordinate system. But here, the only thing is that along with the vector, we also need to know its current position. Because we have seen that in case of the spherical as well as the cylindrical coordinate system, these unit vectors are the function of the θ and the φ. And due to that, for the conversion, we also need to know the current position of the vector. So here, now since we know this conversion matrix, so let's see how to convert the vector from the one coordinate system into the another coordinate system. And to understand that, let's take one simple example. So earlier if you recall, then during the derivation, we took the position vector in the Cartesian coordinate system, right? So now, with the help of this conversion matrix, let's find the equivalent vector in the spherical coordinate system. So in general, that can be given as, this Ar times Ar, plus Aθ times Aθ, plus A5 times A5. So basically, with the help of this conversion matrix, we will find the values of this Ar, Aθ and the A5. So here, as per this relationship, this Ar can be given as, this Axsinθcos5 plus Aysinθsin5. And similarly, the third term will be equal to Azcosθ. So here, since the given vector is the position vector, so these components AxAy and Az will be same as the X, Y and the Z. And here, now since the X, Y and Z are the coordinates, so we can use the coordinate conversion. That means here, we can represent this X, Y and Z in terms of the Ar, Theta and the Phi. So, as per this relationship, this X is equal to Arsinθcos5. Likewise, if you see the Y, then that is equal to Arsinθsin5 and the Z is equal to Arcosθ. So once again if you see, then here in the first two terms, this Arsinθ is common. So if we take it outside, then this cos5 plus sin5 will become 1. And now, this Arsinθ plus Arcosθ will give us the R. That means here, this first term Ar is same as the R, that is the radius of the sphere. So similarly, now let's also find this Aθ. So as per this expression, this Aθ can be given as this Axcosθcos5 plus Aycosθsin5 and the third term will be equal to minus Azsinθ. So once again, here the value of the AxAy and Az will be equal to X, Y and the Z. And once again, now here let's put the values of the X, Y and the Z. So if you further simplify it, then in the first two terms, this sin5 plus cos5 will become 1. That means we will have this Arsinθcosθ. And if you see the second term, then that is equal to minus Arsinθcosθ. That means these two terms will get cancelled out. And we can say that here this Aθ is equal to 0. And similarly, let's also find the AΦ. So as per this conversion matrix, this AΦ can be given as minus Axsin5 plus Aycos5. So once again, let's put the values of the Ax and the Ay. So now, if we perform the coordinate conversion, then here this X is equal to Arsinθcos5. And likewise, this Y is equal to Arsinθsin5. So if you see over here, then these two terms will get cancelled out. So we can say that here this A5 is also equal to 0. So in this way, here this Ar is equal to R, while the Aθ and A5 is equal to 0. That means if we see the equivalent vector in the spherical coordinate system, then that will be equal to R times Ar. So in this way, with the help of this conversion matrix, we can easily convert any vector that is given to us in the Cartesian coordinate system into the spherical coordinate system. And by taking the transpose of this matrix, we can also perform the other way around. So I hope in this video, you understood about the spherical coordinate system and you also understood how to perform the vector conversion between the spherical and the Cartesian coordinate system. So similarly, in the next video, we will see the vector conversion between the spherical and the cylindrical coordinate system. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",spherical coordinate system explained electromagnetic theory,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in the previous video, we understood the importance of the different coordinate systems while learning this electromagnetic theory. and in that video, we also understood about the cylindrical coordinate system. so similarly, in this video, let us learn about the spherical coordinate system. so first, let us understand what are the coordinates in the spherical coordinate system. so in the spherical coordinate system, we have the three coordinates. that is the rθ and the 5. so here, if you see this r, then it is the radial distance from the origin. so if you just want to visualize it, then just draw a sphere from the origin. so here, this r represents the radius of this sphere. so here, this r can vary from 0 to infinity. so we can say that the range of this coordinate r is from 0 to infinity. similarly, the next coordinate is the angle θ. so here, this θ represents the polar angle. so this θ is the angle that is made by this radius with the z-axis. and likewise, this φ is the azimuth angle. so this angle is same as the angle that we have seen in the cylindrical coordinate system. so if we take the projection of this r on the x-y plane and draw a line from the origin, then that represents the ρ. so this φ is the angle between the ρ and the x-axis. so in this way, this θ is the polar angle and the φ is the azimuth angle. so here, this φ is varying in the x-y plane, while this θ is varying in this plane. so here, if you see the range of the θ, then it is varying from 0 to π. so here, when the θ is 0, then the r will be parallel to the z-axis. and whenever it is equal to π, then the r will be in the opposite direction. that means here, the range of the θ is from 0 to π. likewise, if you see this azimuth angle, then it is varying from 0 to 2π. that means this is the range of the coordinates r, θ and the φ. so in this way, if we have been given some point in the 3d space, then we can find its r, θ and the φ coordinates. that means from the origin, if we draw a line towards the point p, then that radial distance corresponds to r. and if we see the angle between the r and the z, then that corresponds to θ. and from that point p, if we take the projection on the x-y plane and connect the intersection point to the origin, then the angle between the x-axis and the ρ represents the φ. and in this way, we can find these coordinates r, θ and the φ. so now, lets see, if we have been given this point p in the spherical coordinate system, then how to represent the same point in the cartesian coordinate system. and then after, we will also see the other way around. so for this spherical to cartesian conversion, lets say, we have some point p in the 3d space, and its coordinates are r, θ and the φ. so here, if we take the projection of this radius r on the z-axis, then we will get the z component. so we can say that, here the z is equal to r cos θ, right. similarly, if you see the ρ, that is the projection of the r on the x-y plane, then that corresponds to r sin θ. so the same thing, if you see in this plane, then you will be able to visualize it better. so here, this z corresponds to r cos θ, while this ρ corresponds to r sin θ. and now, if we take the projection of this ρ on the x-axis, then we can say that, here this x corresponds to ρ cos φ. and likewise, if we take the projection of the ρ on the y-axis, then we will get the y component, that is equal to ρ sin φ. and we already know that, this ρ is equal to r sin θ. so we can say that, here this x is equal to r sin θ cos φ, while the y is equal to r sin θ sin φ. so in this way, we got the coordinates x, y and z in terms of the coordinates r, θ and the φ. so using this expression, we can convert any spherical coordinates into the cartesian coordinates. so similarly, now lets see the other way around, and lets find out, suppose we have been given the coordinates in the cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert it into the spherical coordinate system. so here, we already know these expressions, right? so here, lets perform the x² plus y² plus z². so if we do so, then we will get this r² sin²θ sin²φ plus r² sin²θ cos²5. and for the z², we will get the r² cos²θ. so in the first two terms, if you see, then here, this r² sin²θ is common. so if we take it out, then we will have this sin²φ plus cos²φ. and as you know, that is equal to 1. that means we will have this r² sin²θ plus r² cos²θ. so once again, if we take the r² common, then we will have this sin²θ plus cos²θ. and once again, as you know, that is equal to 1. so we can say that this x² plus y² plus z² corresponds to r². or we can say that this r is equal to square root of x² plus y² plus z². so similarly, now lets find the expression of θ and φ in terms of x, y and z. so here, to find the azimuth angle φ, lets take the ratio of y and x. so if we take the ratio of y and x, then this r sinθ will get cancelled out from the numerator as well as the denominator. and after that, we will have this sinφ divided by cos5. and that is equal to tan5. so we can say that here this φ is equal to tan-inverse y divided by x. so in this way, we also got the expression of the φ in terms of the y and the x. so similarly, now lets also find the expression of the θ. so as you can see over here, this z is equal to rcosθ. and the same thing, we have also seen earlier. so from this, we can say that here this θ is equal to cos-inverse z divided by r. and we already know that this r is equal to square root of x² plus y² plus z². so in this way, we also got the expression of the θ in terms of the x, y and the z. so in this way, we found the relationship between the rθ and the φ in terms of the x, y and the z. that means using these expressions, suppose we have been given coordinates in the spherical coordinate system, then we can find the equivalent coordinates in the cartesian coordinate system. and likewise, using this expression, we can find the other way around. so now, similar to the coordinate conversion, lets see the vector conversion. but before that, first lets see the direction of the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. so lets say, there is some point p in the spherical coordinate system. so if we draw a vector from the origin to this point, then that will represent the position vector. so in general, any vector in the spherical coordinate system can be represented like this. so here, this capital a raθ and a5 are the components of the vector. and likewise, this small a raθ and a5 are the unit vectors in the direction of rθ and the φ. so as i said in the previous video, the spherical and the cylindrical coordinate systems are the curvilinear coordinate system. that means here, the direction of the unit vector will not remain fixed. and rather, it will change with the position of the vector. so in this case, lets see, at the given point, what will be the direction of the unit vectors a raθ and the a5. so in any curvilinear coordinate system, the direction of the unit vector will always be in the increasing direction of the coordinates. so here also, these unit vectors a raθ and the a5 will always point in the increasing direction of this rθ and the φ. so here, at the given point, if you see, then the r is increasing in this direction. that means here, this will be the direction of the unit vector a r. likewise, if you see the azimuth angle φ, then it is varying from 0 to 2π in the xy plane. that means here, at the given point p, the a5 will point in this direction. and likewise, if you see the angle θ, then it is changing in this direction. that means here, at the given point p, this aθ will point in the downward direction. so the same thing you will be able to visualize it better, if i just take the slice of this sphere. so now, if you see over here, then this is the direction of the a raθ and the a5 at the given point. and as you can see over here, all the three unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. or in other words, they are the orthogonal to each other. and since they are the orthogonal, so their dot product will be equal to zero. that means here we can say that this a r.aθ, a r.a5, as well as the aθ.a5 will be equal to zero. and likewise, if we perform the cross product between these unit vectors in the cyclic form, then we will get the another unit vector. for example, here this a r cross aθ will be equal to a5. likewise, this aθ cross a5 will give us the a r. and likewise, the cross product of the unit vectors a5 and a r will give us the unit vector aθ. and suppose, if we reverse the order of this cross product, then we will get the negative sign before the result. for example, here if we perform the aθ cross a r, then we will get the minus a5. so in this way, here this a r, aθ and a5 are the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. so now, let us see the vector conversion between the spherical and the cartesian coordinate system. and we will also see the other way around. that means suppose, we have been given a vector in the spherical coordinate system, then how to convert it into the cartesian coordinate system. and then after, we will also see the other way around. so here, like we have done in case of the cylindrical coordinate system, we will derive the transformation matrix. and with the help of it, we can find the vector in the another coordinate system. so here, instead of just writing this transformation matrix, we will also derive it. and as a first step in the derivation, let us find the unit vector conversion between the two coordinate systems. that means here, first we will see that, if we have been given a unit vector in the cartesian coordinate system, then with the help of it, how we can find the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. and then after, we will see the other way around. and once we find the relationship between these unit vectors, then with the help of it, we will find the relationship between these coefficients ax, ay, az and the a r, aθ and the a5. so as a first step, let us see the unit vector conversion between the cartesian and the spherical coordinate system. so to derive these expressions, once again lets say, there is some point p in the 3d space. and lets say, its coordinates is equal to x, y and z. so now, from the origin, if we draw a vector connecting to this point, then that will represent the position vector. lets say, that is equal to p. so we know that, in general, in the cartesian coordinate system, this vector p can be given as, this ax times ax, plus ay times ay, plus az times az. but here, since it is the position vector, so the value of these components ax, ay and az will be same as the coordinate values x, y and z. let me see here, in this cartesian coordinate, this vector p can also be written as, this this x times ax, plus y times ay, plus z times az. so here if you see, then our aim is to find this ar, aθ and a5, right. but if you see this expression, then this expression does not contain any variables such as rθ and φ. so here, what we will do, we will represent this x, y and z in terms of the rθ and φ. and for that, we already know this relationship, right. so here, specifically we can use this expression, because p is the position vector. and due to that, here this x, y and z represents the coordinate values. so basically, here we are applying the coordinate conversion. so after this conversion, this is how the p can be represented. so basically, here we have put the values of x, y and z in terms of the rθ and φ. so here, if we differentiate this vector p with respect to r, or if we perform the del p divided by del r, then we will get the vector that is increasing in the direction of the r. and if we normalize it, then we will get the unit vector ar. so to find this unit vector ar, first let us perform this del p divided by del r. that means here, we will differentiate this vector p with respect to r. so if we do so, then we will get this sinθcosφax, plus sinθsinφay, plus cosθaz. and if we take its magnitude, then we will get square root of sinθcosφ, plus sinθsin square phi, plus cosθ. so here, in the first two terms, this sinθ is common. so if we take it outside, then in the bracket, we will have cos2phi, plus sin2phi. and we know that, that is equal to 1. that means after the further simplification, once again, we will have square root of sin2θ, plus cos2θ. and once again, that is also equal to 1. so we can say that, here the unit vector ar can be given by this expression. so similarly, now lets find the unit vector aθ. so this unit vector aθ is equal to p divided by θ divided by its magnitude. so here, to perform this p divided by θ, we will differentiate this vector p with respect to θ. so if we do so, then we will get this rcosθcosφax, plus rcosθsinφay. and for the third term, we will get this minus rsinθ. so similarly, now lets also find its magnitude. so its magnitude can be given as, square root of rcosθcos5, plus rcosθsin5. and likewise for the third term, we will have this rsinθ. so once again, here this rcosθ is common in the first two terms. so if we take that outside, then in the bracket, we will have this cos5, plus sin5. and we know that, that is equal to 1. then once again, this r2sin2θ, plus r2cos2θ will become r2. that means the square root of the r2 will be equal to r. so in this way, the magnitude of this p divided by θ is equal to r. so now, to get this unit vector aθ, we need to divide this expression by the r. that means here, this aθ is equal to cosθcos5ax, plus cosθsin5ay, minus sinθaz. so in this way, we also got the expression of the unit vector aθ in terms of the axay and the az. and likewise, now lets also find the unit vector a5. so once again, here this unit vector a5 can be given as, this p divided by 5, divided by its magnitude. so here, to find this p divided by 5, we will differentiate this vector p with respect to 5. and if we do so, then we will get, minus rsinθsin5ax, plus rsinθcos5ay, because the differentiation of the sin5 is equal to cos5. and for the third term, as it does not contain any variable 5, so its differentiation with respect to 5 will be equal to 0. that means here, this will be the expression of p divided by 5. so similarly, now lets also find its magnitude. so here, the magnitude of this p divided by 5 is equal to rsinθsin5, plus rsinθcos5. so once again, in the first two terms, this rsinθ is common. so if we take it outside, then in the bracket, we will have this sin5 plus cos5. and once again, that will be equal to 1. that means now, we will have this rsinθ, and that is equal to rsinθ. so we can say that, here this unit vector a5 is equal to p divided by 5, divided by rsinθ. and that is equal to, minus sin5 times ax, plus cos5 times ay. so in this way, we got the expression of the unit vectors ar, aθ and a5, in terms of the unit vectors ax, ay and az. so similarly, now lets see the other way around, and lets find the relationship between this ax, ay and az, in terms of the ar, aθ and the a5. so here, since we already know this relationship, so for finding that, we will use the bracket projection method. that means if you see any vector, then it can be represented as the linear combination of the unit vectors ar, aθ and the a5. so here, we can represent this ax like this, because here this ar, aθ and a5 are forming the orthonormal base. that means here, first, these three unit vectors are orthogonal to each other, and if you see their magnitude, then that is also equal to 1. so because of that, any vector can be represented like this. that is the combination of the ar, aθ and the a5. and here, if you see this cr, cθ and the c5, then they are the projection of the unit vectors ar, aθ and the a5 in the ax direction. that means here, if you see this cr, then that is equal to this ar.ax, or in other words, that is equal to ax.ar. and as you can see, here the dot product of the unit vectors ax and ar represent the projection of the unit vector ar in the x direction. so here, since we already know this relationship, so we can easily find this ax.ar. and if we perform the dot product of this ax and ar, then we will get this first term. because the second and the third term will become zero. because as we know, this ax.ay is zero, and likewise, this ax.az will also become zero. that means this ax.ar will come out as sinθcos5. likewise, this cθ will be equal to ax.aθ, and that will come out as cosθcos5. and similarly, this c5 is equal to minus sin5. so from this, we can say that here this unit vector ax is equal to sinθcos5 times ar plus cosθcos5 times aθ, and the third term will be equal to minus sin5 times a5. so in this way, we got the expression of the unit vector ax in terms of the ar, aθ and the a5. so similarly, now lets find the unit vectors ay and the az. so similar to the unit vector ax, this ay can also be given as, this cr times ar plus cθ times aθ plus c5 times a5. and once again, here this coefficient cr represents the projection of the unit vector ar in the direction of the ay. that means here, this cr is equal to ay.ar. and here, since we already know this relationship, so we can easily find this ay.ar. that means here, this ay.ar will be equal to sinθsin5. likewise, if you see the cθ, then that will be equal to cosθsin5. and similarly, this c5 will be equal to ay.a5 and that is equal to cos5. so we can say that, this ay is equal to sinθsin5 times ar plus cosθsin5 times aθ. and the third term will be equal to cos5 times a5. so similarly, now lets also find the az. so here, once again this az can be given by this expression. and here, this cr will be equal to az.ar. so here, if we perform this az.ar with this expression, then we will get this last term. that is equal to cosθ. likewise, this cθ will be equal to az.aθ. and in this case, it will come out as minus sinθ. and similarly, this c5 is equal to az.a5. so in this case, that will be equal to zero. that means here, this az will be equal to cosθ times ar minus sinθ times aθ. so in this way, we got the unit vectors ax, ay and az in terms of the ar, aθ and a5. and earlier, we already found the spherical coordinate unit vectors in terms of the cartesian coordinate unit vectors. so now, with the help of it, we can easily find the relationship between the coefficients of the cartesian coordinate and the spherical coordinates. and with the help of it, we can easily perform the vector conversion. so first, lets see the spherical to cartesian vector conversion. that means here, we already have a vector in the spherical coordinate system. so here, what we will do, we will put the values of ar, aθ and a5 in the given expression. so here, if we put the value of ar, then we will get this term. so again, if you want to follow with me, then you can pause the video and you can check it by yourself. similarly, if we put the value of aθ, then we will get this second term. and likewise, by putting the value of a5, we will get the third term. so now, in this entire expression, lets combine the terms related to the ax, ay and the az. so now, if we combine the terms related to the ax, then we will get these three terms. similarly, if we combine the terms related to the ay, then we will get these three terms. and likewise, lets also combine the terms related to the az. so now, if we compare this expression with the general expression of the cartesian coordinate vector, then here we can say that this term corresponds to ax. likewise, this ay corresponds to second term and this az corresponds to third term. so from this, we can say that here this ax is equal to ar sinθcos5 plus aθcosθcos5 and the third term will be equal to minus a5 times sin5. and likewise, we can also find the ay and the az. so in this way, we found the components ax, ay and az in terms of the components ar, aθ and the a5. so here, the same thing can also be represented in the matrix form. so this is the transformation matrix for converting any vector from the spherical coordinate system to the cartesian coordinate system. and in the last video, we have seen that if we just take the transpose of this matrix, then we can also find the conversion matrix for the cartesian to spherical vector conversion. that means here, we just need to change the rows into the column. and now, this matrix is the transformation matrix for the cartesian to spherical vector conversion. that means here, we just need to remember only one conversion matrix. and with the help of the transpose, we can find another one. so in this way, with the help of this conversion matrix, we can convert any vector from the cartesian to the spherical coordinate system as well as from the spherical to the cartesian coordinate system. but here, the only thing is that along with the vector, we also need to know its current position. because we have seen that in case of the spherical as well as the cylindrical coordinate system, these unit vectors are the function of the θ and the φ. and due to that, for the conversion, we also need to know the current position of the vector. so here, now since we know this conversion matrix, so lets see how to convert the vector from the one coordinate system into the another coordinate system. and to understand that, lets take one simple example. so earlier if you recall, then during the derivation, we took the position vector in the cartesian coordinate system, right? so now, with the help of this conversion matrix, lets find the equivalent vector in the spherical coordinate system. so in general, that can be given as, this ar times ar, plus aθ times aθ, plus a5 times a5. so basically, with the help of this conversion matrix, we will find the values of this ar, aθ and the a5. so here, as per this relationship, this ar can be given as, this axsinθcos5 plus aysinθsin5. and similarly, the third term will be equal to azcosθ. so here, since the given vector is the position vector, so these components axay and az will be same as the x, y and the z. and here, now since the x, y and z are the coordinates, so we can use the coordinate conversion. that means here, we can represent this x, y and z in terms of the ar, theta and the phi. so, as per this relationship, this x is equal to arsinθcos5. likewise, if you see the y, then that is equal to arsinθsin5 and the z is equal to arcosθ. so once again if you see, then here in the first two terms, this arsinθ is common. so if we take it outside, then this cos5 plus sin5 will become 1. and now, this arsinθ plus arcosθ will give us the r. that means here, this first term ar is same as the r, that is the radius of the sphere. so similarly, now lets also find this aθ. so as per this expression, this aθ can be given as this axcosθcos5 plus aycosθsin5 and the third term will be equal to minus azsinθ. so once again, here the value of the axay and az will be equal to x, y and the z. and once again, now here lets put the values of the x, y and the z. so if you further simplify it, then in the first two terms, this sin5 plus cos5 will become 1. that means we will have this arsinθcosθ. and if you see the second term, then that is equal to minus arsinθcosθ. that means these two terms will get cancelled out. and we can say that here this aθ is equal to 0. and similarly, lets also find the aφ. so as per this conversion matrix, this aφ can be given as minus axsin5 plus aycos5. so once again, lets put the values of the ax and the ay. so now, if we perform the coordinate conversion, then here this x is equal to arsinθcos5. and likewise, this y is equal to arsinθsin5. so if you see over here, then these two terms will get cancelled out. so we can say that here this a5 is also equal to 0. so in this way, here this ar is equal to r, while the aθ and a5 is equal to 0. that means if we see the equivalent vector in the spherical coordinate system, then that will be equal to r times ar. so in this way, with the help of this conversion matrix, we can easily convert any vector that is given to us in the cartesian coordinate system into the spherical coordinate system. and by taking the transpose of this matrix, we can also perform the other way around. so i hope in this video, you understood about the spherical coordinate system and you also understood how to perform the vector conversion between the spherical and the cartesian coordinate system. so similarly, in the next video, we will see the vector conversion between the spherical and the cylindrical coordinate system. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment

varying from 0 to 2π. that means this is the range of the coordinates r, θ and the φ. so in this way, if we have been given some point in the 3d space, then we can find its r, θ and the φ coordinates. that means from the origin, if we draw a line towards the point p, then that radial distance corresponds to r. and if we see the angle between the r and the z, then that corresponds to θ. and from that point p, if we take the projection on the x-y plane and connect the intersection point to the origin, then the angle between the x-axis and the ρ represents the φ. and in this way, we can find

then after, we will also see the other way around. so for this spherical to cartesian conversion, lets say, we have some point p in the 3d space, and its coordinates are r, θ and the φ. so here, if we take the projection of this radius r on the z-axis, then we will get the z component. so we can say that, here the z is equal to r cos θ, right. similarly, if you see the ρ, that is the projection of the r on the x-y plane, then that corresponds to r sin θ. so the same thing, if you see in this plane, then you will be able to visualize it better. so here, this z corresponds to r cos θ, while this ρ corresponds to r sin θ. and now, if we take the projection of this ρ on the x-axis, then we can say that, here this x corresponds to ρ cos φ. and likewise, if we take the projection of the ρ on the y-axis, then we will get the y component, that is equal to ρ sin φ. and we already know that, this ρ is equal to r sin θ. so we can say that, here this x is equal to r sin θ cos φ, while the y is equal to r sin θ sin φ. so in this way, we got the coordinates x, y and z in terms of the coordinates r, θ and the φ. so using this expression, we can convert any spherical coordinates into the cartesian coordinates. so similarly, now lets see the other way around, and lets find out, suppose we have been given the coordinates in the cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert it into the spherical coordinate system. so here, we already know these expressions, right? so here, lets perform the x² plus y² plus z². so if we do so, then we will get this r² sin²θ sin²φ plus r² sin²θ cos²5. and for the z², we will get the r² cos²θ. so in the first two terms, if you see, then here, this r² sin²θ is common. so if we take it out, then we will have this sin²φ plus cos²φ. and as you know, that is equal to 1. that means we will have this r² sin²θ plus r² cos²θ. so once again, if we take the r² common, then we will have this sin²θ plus cos²θ. and once again, as you know, that is equal to 1. so we can say that this x² plus y² plus z² corresponds to r². or we can say that this r is equal to square root of x² plus y² plus z². so similarly, now lets find the expression of θ and φ in terms of x, y and z. so here, to find the azimuth angle φ, lets take the ratio of y and x. so if we take the ratio of y and x, then this r sinθ will get cancelled out from the numerator as well as the denominator. and after that, we will have this sinφ divided by cos5. and that is equal to tan5. so we can say that here this φ is equal to tan-inverse y divided by x. so in this way, we also got the expression of the φ in terms of the y and the x. so similarly, now lets also find the expression of the θ. so as you can see over here, this z is equal to rcosθ. and the same thing, we have also seen earlier. so from this, we can say that here this θ is equal to cos-inverse z divided by r. and we already know that this r is equal to square root of x² plus y² plus z². so in this way, we also got the expression of the θ in terms of the x, y and the z. so in this way, we found the relationship between the rθ and the φ in terms of the x, y and the z. that means using these expressions, suppose we have been given coordinates in the spherical coordinate system, then we can find the equivalent coordinates in the cartesian coordinate system. and likewise, using this expression, we can find the other way around. so now, similar to the coordinate conversion, lets see the vector conversion. but before that, first lets see the direction of the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. so lets say, there is some point p in the spherical coordinate system. so if we draw a vector from the origin to this point, then that will represent the position vector. so in general, any vector in the spherical coordinate system can be represented like this. so here, this capital a raθ and a5 are the components of the vector. and likewise, this small a raθ and a5 are the unit vectors in the direction of rθ and the φ. so as i said in the previous video, the spherical and the cylindrical coordinate systems are the curvilinear coordinate system. that means here, the direction of the unit vector will not remain fixed. and rather, it will change with the position of the vector. so in this case, lets see, at the given point, what will be the direction of the unit vectors a raθ and the a5. so in any curvilinear coordinate system, the direction of the unit vector will always be in the increasing direction of the coordinates. so here also, these unit vectors a raθ and the a5 will always point in the increasing direction of this rθ and the φ. so here, at the given point, if you see, then the r is increasing in this direction. that means here, this will be the direction of the unit vector a r. likewise, if you see the azimuth angle φ, then it is varying from 0 to 2π in the xy plane. that means here, at the given point p, the a5 will point in this direction. and likewise, if you see the angle θ, then it is changing in this direction. that means here, at the given point p, this aθ will point in the downward direction. so the same thing you will be able to visualize it better, if i just take the slice of this sphere. so now, if you see over here, then this is the direction of the a raθ and the a5 at the given point. and as you can see over here, all the three unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. or in other words, they are the orthogonal to each other. and since they are the orthogonal, so their dot product will be equal to zero. that means here we can say that this a r.aθ, a r.a5, as well as the aθ.a5 will be equal to zero. and likewise, if we perform the cross product between these unit vectors in the cyclic form, then we will get the another unit vector. for example, here this a r cross aθ will be equal to a5. likewise, this aθ cross a5 will give us the a r. and likewise, the cross product of the unit vectors a5 and a r will give us the unit vector aθ. and suppose, if we reverse the order of this cross product, then we will get the negative sign before the result. for example, here if we perform the aθ cross a r, then we will get the minus a5. so in this way, here this a r, aθ and a5 are the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. so now, let us see the vector conversion between the spherical and the cartesian coordinate system. and we will also see the other way around. that means suppose, we have been given a vector in the spherical coordinate system, then how to convert it into the cartesian coordinate system. and then after, we will also see the other way around. so here, like we have done in case of the cylindrical coordinate system, we will derive the transformation matrix. and with the help of it, we can find the vector in the another coordinate system. so here, instead of just writing this transformation matrix, we will also derive it. and as a first step in the derivation, let us find the unit vector conversion between the two coordinate systems. that means here, first we will see that, if we have been given a unit vector in the cartesian coordinate system, then with the help of it, how we can find the unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. and then after, we will see the other way around. and once we find the relationship between these unit vectors, then with the help of it, we will find the relationship between these coefficients ax, ay, az and the a r, aθ and the a5. so as a first step, let us see the unit vector conversion between the cartesian and the spherical coordinate system. so to derive these expressions, once again lets say, there is some point p in the 3d space. and lets say, its coordinates is equal to x, y and z. so now, from the origin, if we draw a vector connecting to this point, then that will represent the position vector. lets say, that is equal to p. so we know that, in general, in the cartesian coordinate system, this vector p can be given as, this ax times ax, plus ay times ay, plus az times az. but here, since it is the position vector, so the value of these components ax, ay and az will be same as the coordinate values x, y and z. let me see here, in this cartesian coordinate, this vector p can also be written as, this this x times ax, plus y times ay, plus z times az. so here if you see, then our aim is to find this ar, aθ and a5, right. but if you see this expression, then this expression does not contain any variables such as rθ and φ. so here, what we will do, we will represent this x, y and z in terms of the rθ and φ. and for that, we already know this relationship, right. so here, specifically we can use this expression, because p is the position vector. and due to that, here this x, y and z represents the coordinate values. so basically, here we are applying the coordinate conversion. so after this conversion, this is how the p can be represented. so basically, here we have put the values of x, y and z in terms of the rθ and φ. so here, if we differentiate this vector p with respect to r, or if we perform the del p divided by del r, then we will get the vector that is increasing in the direction of the r. and if we normalize it, then we will get the unit vector ar. so to find this unit vector ar, first let us perform this del p divided by del r. that means here, we will differentiate this vector p with respect to r. so if we do so, then we will get this sinθcosφax, plus sinθsinφay, plus cosθaz. and if we take its magnitude, then we will get square root of sinθcosφ, plus sinθsin square phi, plus cosθ. so here, in the first two terms, this sinθ is common. so if we take it outside, then in the bracket, we will have cos2phi, plus sin2phi. and we know that, that is equal to 1. that means after the further simplification, once again, we will have square root of sin2θ, plus cos2θ. and once again, that is also equal to 1. so we can say that, here the unit vector ar can be given by this expression. so similarly, now lets find the unit vector aθ. so this unit vector aθ is equal to p divided by θ divided by its magnitude. so here, to perform this p divided by θ, we will differentiate this vector p with respect to θ. so if we do so, then we will get this rcosθcosφax, plus rcosθsinφay. and for the third term, we will get this minus rsinθ. so similarly, now lets also find its magnitude. so its magnitude can be given as, square root of rcosθcos5, plus rcosθsin5. and likewise for the third term, we will have this rsinθ. so once again, here this rcosθ is common in the first two terms. so if we take that outside, then in the bracket, we will have this cos5, plus sin5. and we know that, that is equal to 1. then once again, this r2sin2θ, plus r2cos2θ will become r2. that means the square root of the r2 will be equal to r. so in this way, the magnitude of this p divided by θ is equal to r. so now, to get this unit vector aθ, we need to divide this expression by the r. that means here, this aθ is equal to cosθcos5ax, plus cosθsin5ay, minus sinθaz. so in this way, we also got the expression of the unit vector aθ in terms of the axay and the az. and likewise, now lets also find the unit vector a5. so once again, here this unit vector a5 can be given as, this p divided by 5, divided by its magnitude. so here, to find this p divided by 5, we will differentiate this vector p with respect to 5. and if we do so, then we will get, minus rsinθsin5ax, plus rsinθcos5ay, because the differentiation of the sin5 is equal to cos5. and for the third term, as it does not contain any variable 5, so its differentiation with respect to 5 will be equal to 0. that means here, this will be the expression of p divided by 5. so similarly, now lets also find its magnitude. so here, the magnitude of this p divided by 5 is equal to rsinθsin5, plus rsinθcos5. so once again, in the first two terms, this rsinθ is common. so if we take it outside, then in the bracket, we will have this sin5 plus cos5. and once again, that will be equal to 1. that means now, we will have this rsinθ, and that is equal to rsinθ. so we can say that, here this unit vector a5 is equal to p divided by 5, divided by rsinθ. and that is equal to, minus sin5 times ax, plus cos5 times ay. so in this way, we got the expression of the unit vectors ar, aθ and a5, in terms of the unit vectors ax, ay and az. so similarly, now lets see the other way around, and lets find the relationship between this ax, ay and az, in terms of the ar, aθ and the a5. so here, since we already know this relationship, so for finding that, we will use the bracket projection method. that means if you see any vector, then it can be represented as the linear combination of the unit vectors ar, aθ and the a5. so here, we can represent this ax like this, because here this ar, aθ and a5 are forming the orthonormal base. that means here, first, these three unit vectors are orthogonal to each other, and if you see their magnitude, then that is also equal to 1. so because of that, any vector can be represented like this. that is the combination of the ar, aθ and the a5. and here, if you see this cr, cθ and the c5, then they are the projection of the unit vectors ar, aθ and the a5 in the ax direction. that means here, if you see this cr, then that is equal to this ar.ax, or in other words, that is equal to ax.ar. and as you can see, here the dot product of the unit vectors ax and ar represent the projection of the unit vector ar in the x direction. so here, since we already know this relationship, so we can easily find this ax.ar. and if we perform the dot product of this ax and ar, then we will get this first term. because the second and the third term will become zero. because as we know, this ax.ay is zero, and likewise, this ax.az will also become zero. that means this ax.ar will come out as sinθcos5. likewise, this cθ will be equal to ax.aθ, and that will come out as cosθcos5. and similarly, this c5 is equal to minus sin5. so from this, we can say that here this unit vector ax is equal to sinθcos5 times ar plus cosθcos5 times aθ, and the third term will be equal to minus sin5 times a5. so in this way, we got the expression of the unit vector ax in terms of the ar, aθ and the a5. so similarly, now lets find the unit vectors ay and the az. so similar to the unit vector ax, this ay can also be given as, this cr times ar plus cθ times aθ plus c5 times a5. and once again, here this coefficient cr represents the projection of the unit vector ar in the direction of the ay. that means here, this cr is equal to ay.ar. and here, since we already know this relationship, so we can easily find this ay.ar. that means here, this ay.ar will be equal to sinθsin5. likewise, if you see the cθ, then that will be equal to cosθsin5. and similarly, this c5 will be equal to ay.a5 and that is equal to cos5. so we can say that, this ay is equal to sinθsin5 times ar plus cosθsin5 times aθ. and the third term will be equal to cos5 times a5. so similarly, now lets also find the az. so here, once again this az can be given by this expression. and here, this cr will be equal to az.ar. so here, if we perform this az.ar with this expression, then we will get this last term. that is equal to cosθ. likewise, this cθ will be equal to az.aθ. and in this case, it will come out as minus sinθ. and similarly, this c5 is equal to az.a5. so in this case, that will be equal to zero. that means here, this az will be equal to cosθ times ar minus sinθ times aθ. so in this way, we got the unit vectors ax, ay and az in terms of the ar, aθ and a5. and earlier, we already found the spherical coordinate unit vectors in terms of the cartesian coordinate unit vectors. so now, with the help of it, we can easily find the relationship between the coefficients of the cartesian coordinate and the spherical coordinates. and with the help of it, we can easily perform the vector conversion. so first, lets see the spherical to cartesian vector conversion. that means here, we already have a vector in the spherical coordinate system. so here, what we will do, we will put the values of ar, aθ and a5 in the given expression. so here, if we put the value of ar, then we will get this term. so again, if you want to follow with me, then you can pause the video and you can check it by yourself. similarly, if we put the value of aθ, then we will get this second term. and likewise, by putting the value of a5, we will get the third term. so now, in this entire expression, lets combine the terms related to the ax, ay and the az. so now, if we combine the terms related to the ax, then we will get these three terms. similarly, if we combine the terms related to the ay, then we will get these three terms. and likewise, lets also combine the terms related to the az. so now, if we compare this expression with the general expression of the cartesian coordinate vector, then here we can say that this term corresponds to ax. likewise, this ay corresponds to second term and this az corresponds to third term. so from this, we can say that here this ax is equal to ar sinθcos5 plus aθcosθcos5 and the third term will be equal to minus a5 times sin5. and likewise, we can also find the ay and the az. so in this way, we found the components ax, ay and az in terms of the components ar, aθ and the a5. so here, the same thing can also be represented in the matrix form. so this is the transformation matrix for converting any vector from the spherical coordinate system to the cartesian coordinate system. and in the last video, we have seen that if we just take the transpose of this matrix, then we can also find the conversion matrix for the cartesian to spherical vector conversion. that means here, we just need to change the rows into the column. and now, this matrix is the transformation matrix for the cartesian to spherical vector conversion. that means here, we just need to remember only one conversion matrix. and with the help of the transpose, we can find another one. so in this way, with the help of this conversion matrix, we can convert any vector from the cartesian to the spherical coordinate system as well as from the spherical to the cartesian coordinate system. but here, the only thing is that along with the vector, we also need to know its current position. because we have seen that in case of the spherical as well as the cylindrical coordinate system, these unit vectors are the function of the θ and the φ. and due to that, for the conversion, we also need to know the current position of the vector. so here, now since we know this conversion matrix, so lets see how to convert the vector from the one coordinate system into the another coordinate system. and to understand that, lets take one simple example. so earlier if you recall, then during the derivation, we took the position vector in the cartesian coordinate system, right? so now, with the help of this conversion matrix, lets find the equivalent vector in the spherical coordinate system. so in general, that can be given as, this ar times ar, plus aθ times aθ, plus a5 times a5. so basically, with the help of this conversion matrix, we will find the values of this ar, aθ and the a5. so here, as per this relationship, this ar can be given as, this axsinθcos5 plus aysinθsin5. and similarly, the third term will be equal to azcosθ. so here, since the given vector is the position vector, so these components axay and az will be same as the x, y and the z. and here, now since the x, y and z are the coordinates, so we can use the coordinate conversion. that means here, we can represent this x, y and z in terms of the ar, theta and the phi. so, as per this relationship, this x is equal to arsinθcos5. likewise, if you see the y, then that is equal to arsinθsin5 and the z is equal to arcosθ. so once again if you see, then here in the first two terms, this arsinθ is common. so if we take it outside, then this cos5 plus sin5 will become 1. and now, this arsinθ plus arcosθ will give us the r. that means here, this first term ar is same as the r, that is the radius of the sphere. so similarly, now lets also find this aθ. so as per this expression, this aθ can be given as this axcosθcos5 plus aycosθsin5 and the third term will be equal to minus azsinθ. so once again, here the value of the axay and az will be equal to x, y and the z. and once again, now here lets put the values of the x, y and the z. so if you further simplify it, then in the first two terms, this sin5 plus cos5 will become 1. that means we will have this arsinθcosθ. and if you see the second term, then that is equal to minus arsinθcosθ. that means these two terms will get cancelled out. and we can say that here this aθ is equal to 0. and similarly, lets also find the aφ. so as per this conversion matrix, this aφ can be given as minus axsin5 plus aycos5. so once again, lets put the values of the ax and the ay. so now, if we perform the coordinate conversion, then here this x is equal to arsinθcos5. and likewise, this y is equal to arsinθsin5. so if you see over here, then these two terms will get cancelled out. so we can say that here this a5 is also equal to 0. so in this way, here this ar is equal to r, while the aθ and a5 is equal to 0. that means if we see the equivalent vector in the spherical coordinate system, then that will be equal to r times ar. so in this way, with the help of this conversion matrix, we can easily convert any vector that is given to us in the cartesian coordinate system into the spherical coordinate system. and by taking the transpose of this matrix, we can also perform the other way around. so i hope in this video, you understood about the spherical coordinate system and you also understood how to perform the vector conversion between the spherical and the cartesian coordinate system. so similarly,

c_uhZ-yl-Rs,Cylindrical Coordinate System Explained | Cartesian to Cylindrical Vector Conversion Explained,2025-12-25 18:51:09+00:00,2025,12,Thursday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in the earlier videos of the electromagnetic theory, we understood about the vector algebra. So now in this video, and in the upcoming videos, we will learn about the different coordinate systems. So the first question that comes to in our mind is like, what is the point of learning these different coordinate systems in the electromagnetic theory, right? So the reason is that, if you see the real-world examples in the electromagnetics, then the different objects have the certain symmetry. For example, if you take the case of the parallel plate capacitors or the circuit board traces, then they have the planar symmetry. So while dealing with such objects, it is easy to define the electric and magnetic fields in the Cartesian coordinate. And in fact, it also becomes easy to solve the Maxwell equations as well as the boundary conditions in the Cartesian coordinate. But on the other hand, if you see the coaxial cables or the long wires, then they have the axial symmetry. So for such objects, when we are defining the electric fields or solving the Maxwell equations, then it is easy to represent them in the cylindrical coordinate system. So when we define them in their suitable coordinate system, then what happens is that many variables can get eliminated. So because of that, the representation of the vectors as well as solving the Maxwell equation becomes easy. And the same is the case when we represent the point charge or dealing with the antennas, because they have the spherical symmetry. So in such cases, it is better to represent the electric field in the spherical coordinate And suppose if the electric and magnetic fields are not known in the suitable coordinate system, then we can also convert them in the suitable coordinate system. So along with the knowledge of the coordinate system, we should also know that how to convert the field vectors, which is given in the one coordinate system into another coordinate system. So if we know that, then based on the symmetry, sometimes very complex looking equations can be simplified to the very simple form. So during this video, we will see the cylindrical coordinate system. And we will also learn that how to convert the vectors, which is given in the one coordinate system into another coordinate system. So as you are rightly imaging, this video will have a lot of mathematical expressions. But once we understand it clearly, then in the upcoming videos, it will become very easy to understand the different electromagnetic concepts. Alright, so now in the earlier videos, while discussing the vector algebra, we have already discussed the Cartesian coordinate system. So in the Cartesian coordinate system, if we have some point P in the 3D space, then it can be defined by its three coordinates x, y and z, where this x, y and z represents the distance of this point P from the origin in the respective direction. So similarly, we have also seen that, how to represent any vector in the Cartesian coordinate. So here, these ax, ay and az are the unit vectors in the direction of x, y and z. And likewise, these capital A x, ay and az are the components of the vector in the x, y and z direction respectively. Now if you see the unit vectors in the Cartesian coordinate, then that direction always remains fixed irrespective of the position of the vectors. That means even if the position of the vector changes, then also, the direction of these unit vectors in the Cartesian coordinate always remains fixed. That means here, the ax will always remain in this direction. And likewise, the ay and az will always point in respective directions. But that is not the case in case of the cylindrical as well as the spherical coordinate system. So if you see the cylindrical and the spherical coordinate system, then they are the curvilinear coordinate system. But this Cartesian coordinate system is the rectilinear. That means if we keep the two axes constant, and changes the another one, then you will move in the straight direction. For example, if we keep the x and z coordinates constant, and changes the y coordinate, then we will move in the straight line. That means in this Cartesian coordinate, the direction of the unit vectors always remains fixed. But that is not the case in case of the cylindrical as well as the spherical coordinate system. So to understand that, first in this video, let us learn about this cylindrical coordinate system. So we know that, in case of the Cartesian coordinate system, we have the three coordinates x, y and z. So similarly, in the cylindrical coordinate system, we have the rho, phi and the z. So to understand what is this rho, just imagine a cylinder that is centered around the z-axis. So this rho represents the radius of this cylinder. So in this cylindrical coordinate system, this rho can increase from 0 to infinity. So we can say that, here the range of the rho is from 0 to infinity. So similarly, this phi represents the azimuth angle. So here, this azimuth angle phi is the angle that is made by the radius with the x-axis. So here, this phi can vary from 0 to 2π. So we can say that, the range of the angle phi is from 0 to 2π. And likewise, this z is the linear distance of the point from the x-y plane. So similar to the Cartesian coordinate, this z can vary from the minus infinity to the plus infinity. That means here, the range of the z is from minus infinity to the plus infinity. So in this way, in this cylindrical coordinate system, we have the coordinates rho, phi and the z. So now let's say, there is some point P in the 3D space. And now, starting from the origin, if we draw a vector that is connecting this point P, and that will be the position vector in the 3D space. So in the cylindrical coordinate system, if we represent this vector A, then it can be represented like this. Where this small a rho, a phi and the az represents the unit vectors in the cylindrical coordinate system. And unlike the Cartesian coordinate, these unit vectors won't always point in the same direction. And rather, their direction always depends on the position of the vector. So here, first of all, for the given point, let's find out the rho. So here, if we take the projection of this vector on the x-y plane, then we will get this rho. And now, if I draw the imaginary cylinder that is passing through the z-axis, then this will be its radius. So here, this distance represents the rho. So now, let me also draw the line that is parallel to this radius. So here, if you see the direction of this unit vector a rho, then it will be in the incremental direction of the rho. So this a rho is known as the radial unit vector. So at a given point, it is pointing in this direction. But suppose if the point changes, then the direction of this a rho will also change. So similarly, now let's see the direction of the a phi. So here, this angle represents the a phi. And as you can see over here, this phi is increasing in this direction. That means here, this unit vector a phi will also point in the direction in which this phi angle is increasing. So that will be in this direction. And if you see its direction, then it is tangent to the cylinder. And therefore, sometimes this vector is also known as the tangential vector. And likewise, the direction of the unit vector az will be parallel to the z-axis. So at this point if you see, then this a rho, a phi and the az are orthogonal to each other. That means here, all the three unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. So because of that, if we take the dot product of any two unit vectors, then that will be equal to zero. Because in the earlier video of the dot product, we have seen that if the two unit vectors or in general if the two vectors are orthogonal to each other, then that dot product will remain zero. That means here, if we perform the a rho dot a phi or the a phi dot az, then that will be remain zero. And likewise, this az dot a rho will also be equal to zero. But on the other hand, if we perform the dot product with the unit vector itself, then that will be always 1. That means in this case, this a rho dot a rho will be 1. And likewise, this a phi dot a phi and the az dot az will also be equal to 1. That means the dot product of the unit vector with itself will be equal to 1. And likewise, if we perform the cross product between the two unit vectors in the cyclic order, then we will get the another unit vector. For example, if we perform the cross product between the a rho and the a phi, then we will get the az. So likewise, if we perform the a phi cross az, then we will get the a rho. And similarly, this az cross a rho will give us the a phi. So that is all about the unit vectors in the cylindrical coordinate system. So similarly, if you see this a rho, a phi and the az, then they are the components of the unit vector in the respective directions. So very soon, we shall see that how to find these components. But before that, first let us see, if we have been given one point in the cylindrical coordinate system, then how to convert it into the Cartesian coordinate system. And vice versa, we will also see that if the point is given in the Cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert it into the cylindrical coordinate system. Because this conversion will be required for finding this a rho, a phi and the az. So to find that, first let us project this point on the xy plane. So here, this distance will be the z. So in this way, we will get our z coordinate. So as you can see over here, in both coordinate systems, the z component remains the same. So now, let us connect this point with the origin. So this distance represents the rho. And now, the angle that is made by this line with the x-axis represents the azimuth angle. That is equal to 5. So if we take the projection of this rho on the x-axis, then we will get the x component. So we can say that here the x is equal to rho cos phi. And likewise, if we take the projection on the y-axis, then we will get the y component. That is equal to rho sin phi. So from this, we can say that here this x is equal to rho cos phi, while the y is equal to rho sin phi. So in this way, for any given point, if we have been given the coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system, then using this formula, we can convert it into the Cartesian coordinate system. So similarly, now let us see the other way around. And let us find out, suppose we have been given a point in the Cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert that point in the cylindrical coordinate system. So we already know this relationship, right? That means here, during the Cartesian-to-cylindrical conversion also, this z component will remain the same. So now, to find this rho, let us do the x-square plus y-square. So here, if we perform the x-square plus y-square, then we will get this rho-square cos-square phi plus rho-square sin-square phi. So if we take this rho-square outside, then we will have this sin-square phi plus cos-square phi. And that is equal to 1. So we can say that, here this x-square plus y-square is equal to rho-square. Or we can say that, this rho is equal to square root of x-square plus y-square. And similarly, from this relationship, if we take the ratio of y and x, then we will get the tan phi. So if we take the inverse, then this azimuth angle phi can be given as tan-inverse of y by x. So in this way, if we have been given a point in the 3D space in the Cartesian coordinate system, then using this relationship, we can find the corresponding cylindrical coordinates. Then other way around, suppose we have been given the coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system, then using this relationship, we can find the corresponding cartesian coordinates. So now, once we know this coordinate conversion from the cartesian to cylindrical as well as the cylindrical to cartesian coordinate, then the next important thing, which we should know is the vector conversion. That means, suppose if we have been given the vector in the cartesian coordinate, then how to convert it into the cylindrical coordinates. And vice versa, suppose we have the vector in the cylindrical coordinates, then how to convert it back into the cartesian coordinates. So here, instead of directly applying the straightforward transformation, we will derive those expressions so that you have a better understanding about the process. So as a first step, what we will do, we will find the unit vector transformation. And we will see that how to convert the unit vectors from the cartesian coordinates to the cylindrical coordinates. And then after, we will see the other way around. So once we get that relation, then we will replace these unit vectors by that newly found expression. And with the help of it, we can find the relationship between the components ax, ay, az and the a row, a phi and the az. So as a first step, let us see the unit vector conversion. And let us see how to convert the unit vectors from the cartesian coordinates to the cylindrical coordinates. So for that, first let us take some point R in the cartesian coordinate. And let's say the position vector which is connecting this point is equal to R. So this position vector can be written as this x times ax plus y times ay plus z times az. Because as you know, in the cartesian coordinates for the position vector, the components of the vector will be same as the coordinate values. So now, if you see over here, then what we need to find is, the unit vectors in the direction of the row phi and the z. And if you see this expression, then it does not contain any variables such as row phi and the z. So here, what we will do, we will replace this x, y and z with their corresponding cylindrical coordinates. And here, we can do that because this x, y and z indeed corresponds to the coordinate values. So now, if you see the expression of the position vector, then it is in the form of row phi and the z. So now, when we differentiate this vector with respect to the variable row, then we will get the vector which is incrementing in the direction of the row. And whenever we normalize it, then we will get the unit vector. So that vector is actually the a row. So if you recall, then earlier for the cylindrical coordinates, we have seen that these unit vectors a row, a phi and the az are pointing in the incremental direction of this row phi and the z. So that's why, here this term will also correspond to a row. Likewise, if we differentiate this position vector R with respect to phi and normalize it, then we will get the unit vector a phi and likewise, we can also get the az. So now, first let us find this a row. So to find this a row, first let us differentiate this position vector with respect to row. So here, if you see this del R by del Rho, then that will be equal to cos phi times ax plus sine phi times ay. And here, since this term does not contain any row variable, so that will become 0. And now, if we take its magnitude, then that will be equal to square root of cos square phi plus sine square phi and that is equal to 1. So we can say that here this unit vector a row is equal to cos phi times ax plus sine phi times ay. So in this way, here we got this unit vector a row in terms of the ax, ay and the az. So similarly, now let us find the unit vector a phi. So this a phi can be given as this del R divided by del phi divided by the magnitude of it. So here, if we differentiate this R with respect to phi, then we will get this minus rho times sine phi ax plus rho times this cos phi times ay. And once again, since the third term does not contain any variable phi, so it will become 0. So now, if we take its magnitude, then that will be equal to square root of rho square sine square phi plus rho square cos square phi. So here, if we take this rho square common, then we will have this sine square phi plus cos square phi and as you know that is equal to 1. So from this we can say that here this del R divided by del phi is equal to rho. And therefore, here this unit vector a phi is equal to minus sine phi times ax plus cos phi times ay. So similarly, now let us see the unit vector az. So once again, as per the definition, this az can be given as this del R divided by del z divided by its magnitude. So we know that in both cylindrical as well as the Cartesian coordinates, the z coordinate remains the same. So that's why this az should also remain as it is. But here, let us also prove that. So here, this del R divided by del z will be equal to az. Because if you see, then the first and the second term of this position vector does not contain any variable z. So that's why they will become 0. And for the third term, if we differentiate with respect to z, then we will get the az. And we know that the magnitude of the unit vector is same as the 1. So therefore, the az in the cylindrical coordinate system will be same as the Cartesian coordinate system. And in this way, we got the unit vectors a rho, a phi and az in terms of the ax, ay and the az. So similarly, now let us see the other way around and let us find out the unit vectors ax, ay and az in terms of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. So here, since we already know this relationship, so we will find the unit vectors ax, ay and az with the help of the projection method. And in that, first we will find the unit vector ax. So in general, this unit vector ax can be expressed as the combination of these vectors a rho, a phi and the az, where here this 0, c phi and the cz are the projection of this unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az in the direction of the ax. That means here, this 0 is equal to this ax dot a rho. And as you know, it is nothing but the projection of the vector a rho in the direction of the ax. So here, since we already know the unit vector a rho in terms of the ax and ay, so we can easily perform this ax dot a rho. So here, if we perform this ax dot a rho, then we will get only this first term. Because for the second term, this ax dot ay will become 0. That means here, this ax dot a rho is equal to cos phi. Likewise, this c phi is equal to ax dot a phi and that is equal to minus sin phi. And similarly, this cz is equal to ax dot az and that is equal to 0. So from this, we can say that this ax is equal to this cos phi times a rho minus sin phi times a phi. So in this way, we got this unit vector ax in terms of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. So similarly, now let us find the unit vector ay. So once again, this unit vector ay can be expressed as the combination of these vectors a rho, a phi and the az. So here, this c rho is equal to ay dot a rho. And in this case, that will be equal to sin phi. Likewise, if we perform this c phi, then that is equal to ay dot a phi. And in this case, that is equal to cos phi. And likewise, this cz will be equal to 0. So we can say that here this ay is equal to sin phi times a rho plus cos phi times a phi. And in this way, we also found the relationship between the unit vector ay in terms of the a rho, a phi and the az. So likewise, let us also see the az. So as we have seen, for the both coordinate system, the az remains the same. So based on this projection method also, we should get the same result. So as per this method, this az is equal to the combination of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. So here, this c rho will be equal to az dot a rho. And as you can see over here, as the a rho, a phi does not contain any z component, so it will be equal to 0. That means here, this first coefficient is equal to 0. And likewise, this c phi will also be equal to 0. And then, if we see this cz, then that is equal to az dot az. And as you know, that is equal to 1. That means in this case, this az will be equal to az. And that is the expected result, right? So in this way, we got the Cartesian unit vectors in terms of the cylindrical unit vectors. And earlier, we already found the cylindrical unit vectors in terms of the Cartesian unit vectors. So now, with the help of it, we can find the transformation between the coefficients ax, ay and az and the a rho, a phi and the az. So here, what we will do, first we will find the relationship between the components ax, ay and az in terms of the a rho, a phi and the az. So basically, here we will find the vector in the Cartesian coordinate from the cylindrical coordinates. That means here, we already know the vector in the cylindrical coordinates. So that is equal to a rho times a rho plus a phi times a phi plus az times az. So now in this expression, let us put the values of the a rho, a phi and the az. So if we put the value, then we will get this expression. So if required, then you can pause the video and check this expression. So now from this expression, let us combine the terms which contains the unit vector ax. So if we combine that, then we will get this a rho times cos phi minus a phi times sin phi. Similarly, let us combine the terms related to this ay. So if we do so, then we will get this a rho times sin phi plus a phi times cos phi. And likewise, the last term will be equal to az. So now, if we compare this expression with the Cartesian vector, then the first term corresponds to ax. Likewise, the second term corresponds to ay. And the last term will be equal to az. So from this, we can say that this ax is equal to this a rho times cos phi minus a phi times sin phi. Likewise, this ay is equal to a rho times sin phi plus a phi times cos phi. And this third term az will remain as it is. So in this way, we found the relationship between the components ax, ay and az in terms of the cylindrical components. And here, the same thing can also be written in the matrix form. So this is the transformation matrix for converting the vector that is given to us in the cylindrical coordinate to the Cartesian coordinate. So similarly, now let us see the other way around and let us find the Cartesian to cylindrical conversion. That means now, the vector that is given to us is in the Cartesian coordinate. So now in this expression, let us put the values of the ax, ay and the az. So if we put the value, then we will get this expression. So once again, if required, then you can pause the video. So now, from this expression, let us combine the terms related to a rho. So if we combine that, then we will get the term that is ax cos phi plus ay sin phi. Similarly, let us combine the terms related to a phi. So if we combine those terms, then we will get minus ax sin phi plus ay cos phi. And likewise, the third term will remain as it is. So now, let us compare this expression with the vector expression that we want to find in the cylindrical coordinate system. That means here, this term corresponds to a rho and likewise, this term corresponds to a phi. So from this, we can say that over here, this a rho is equal to ax cos phi plus ay sin phi. And likewise, this a phi is equal to minus ax sin phi plus ay cos phi. And the az will remain as it is. So in this way, we also found the cylindrical vector components a rho, a phi and az in terms of the Cartesian coordinates. And the same thing can also be written in the matrix form. So now, if you compare this matrix with the cylindrical to the Cartesian convergence matrix, then we can find that by just taking the transpose of the given matrix. And vice versa, it is also possible. That means here, we just need to remember only one transformation matrix. And from that, we can easily write another one. So with the help of this transformation matrix, we can convert the vector from the cylindrical to the Cartesian coordinates, as well as from the Cartesian to the cylindrical coordinates. So earlier if you recall, then for the simplicity of the derivation, we have assumed that the given vector is the position vector. And we have assumed that the point in the Cartesian coordinate is equal to x, y and z. So the corresponding position vector was x times ax plus y times ay plus z times az. That means in case of the Cartesian coordinate, if we have the position vector, then the components of the unit vectors are same as the coordinate values. But that is not the case in case of the cylindrical coordinate system. So now, with the help of the transformation matrix, let's see what will be the expression of the given vector in the cylindrical coordinates. So we know that the vector components in the cylindrical coordinate system can be represented like this. So here, if you see this a rho, then that is equal to ax cos5 plus ay sin5. So in this case, this ax is equal to x, while the ay is equal to y. And moreover, we also know that this x is equal to rho cos5, while the y is equal to rho sin5. So if we put the values of x and y, then we will get this rho times cos2 5 plus rho times sin2 5. And as you know, this cos2 5 plus sin2 5 is equal to 1. So we can say that this a rho is equal to rho. So similarly, let's find the a5. So as per this transformation matrix, this a5 can be given as minus ax sin5 plus ay cos5. So once again, if we put the values of the ax and ay, then this a5 expression can be written as minus x sin5 plus y cos5. So once again, we know that here this x is equal to rho cos5, while the y is equal to rho sin5. So if we put these values, then this a5 will be equal to minus rho times cos5 times sin5 plus rho times sin5 times cos5. So as you can see over here, both these terms will get cancelled out. And therefore, this a5 will come out as zero. So in this way, we also got the second term. And as you can see, this az will be same as az. So in this way, we got all the components. And from this, we can say that this vector a is equal to rho times a rho plus z times az. So in this way, with the help of this transformation matrix, we can convert any vector that is given to us in the Cartesian coordinate to the cylindrical coordinate. And if we take the transpose of this matrix, then we will get the relationship between the ax, ay and az in terms of the a rho, a5 and az. So in this way, in this video, we learned about the cylindrical coordinate system. And we understood that how to convert the point that is given to us in the Cartesian coordinate to the cylindrical coordinates. And we have also seen the other way around. And then after, we also understood the vector conversion between the two coordinate systems. So in the next video, similarly, we will learn about the spherical coordinate system. And we will also see the vector conversion between the Cartesian and the spherical coordinate system. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",cylindrical coordinate system explained cartesian to cylindrical vector conversion explained,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in the earlier videos of the electromagnetic theory, we understood about the vector algebra. so now in this video, and in the upcoming videos, we will learn about the different coordinate systems. so the first question that comes to in our mind is like, what is the point of learning these different coordinate systems in the electromagnetic theory, right? so the reason is that, if you see the real-world examples in the electromagnetics, then the different objects have the certain symmetry. for example, if you take the case of the parallel plate capacitors or the circuit board traces, then they have the planar symmetry. so while dealing with such objects, it is easy to define the electric and magnetic fields in the cartesian coordinate. and in fact, it also becomes easy to solve the maxwell equations as well as the boundary conditions in the cartesian coordinate. but on the other hand, if you see the coaxial cables or the long wires, then they have the axial symmetry. so for such objects, when we are defining the electric fields or solving the maxwell equations, then it is easy to represent them in the cylindrical coordinate system. so when we define them in their suitable coordinate system, then what happens is that many variables can get eliminated. so because of that, the representation of the vectors as well as solving the maxwell equation becomes easy. and the same is the case when we represent the point charge or dealing with the antennas, because they have the spherical symmetry. so in such cases, it is better to represent the electric field in the spherical coordinate and suppose if the electric and magnetic fields are not known in the suitable coordinate system, then we can also convert them in the suitable coordinate system. so along with the knowledge of the coordinate system, we should also know that how to convert the field vectors, which is given in the one coordinate system into another coordinate system. so if we know that, then based on the symmetry, sometimes very complex looking equations can be simplified to the very simple form. so during this video, we will see the cylindrical coordinate system. and we will also learn that how to convert the vectors, which is given in the one coordinate system into another coordinate system. so as you are rightly imaging, this video will have a lot of mathematical expressions. but once we understand it clearly, then in the upcoming videos, it will become very easy to understand the different electromagnetic concepts. alright, so now in the earlier videos, while discussing the vector algebra, we have already discussed the cartesian coordinate system. so in the cartesian coordinate system, if we have some point p in the 3d space, then it can be defined by its three coordinates x, y and z, where this x, y and z represents the distance of this point p from the origin in the respective direction. so similarly, we have also seen that, how to represent any vector in the cartesian coordinate. so here, these ax, ay and az are the unit vectors in the direction of x, y and z. and likewise, these capital a x, ay and az are the components of the vector in the x, y and z direction respectively. now if you see the unit vectors in the cartesian coordinate, then that direction always remains fixed irrespective of the position of the vectors. that means even if the position of the vector changes, then also, the direction of these unit vectors in the cartesian coordinate always remains fixed. that means here, the ax will always remain in this direction. and likewise, the ay and az will always point in respective directions. but that is not the case in case of the cylindrical as well as the spherical coordinate system. so if you see the cylindrical and the spherical coordinate system, then they are the curvilinear coordinate system. but this cartesian coordinate system is the rectilinear. that means if we keep the two axes constant, and changes the another one, then you will move in the straight direction. for example, if we keep the x and z coordinates constant, and changes the y coordinate, then we will move in the straight line. that means in this cartesian coordinate, the direction of the unit vectors always remains fixed. but that is not the case in case of the cylindrical as well as the spherical coordinate system. so to understand that, first in this video, let us learn about this cylindrical coordinate system. so we know that, in case of the cartesian coordinate system, we have the three coordinates x, y and z. so similarly, in the cylindrical coordinate system, we have the rho, phi and the z. so to understand what is this rho, just imagine a cylinder that is centered around the z-axis. so this rho represents the radius of this cylinder. so in this cylindrical coordinate system, this rho can increase from 0 to infinity. so we can say that, here the range of the rho is from 0 to infinity. so similarly, this phi represents the azimuth angle. so here, this azimuth angle phi is the angle that is made by the radius with the x-axis. so here, this phi can vary from 0 to 2π. so we can say that, the range of the angle phi is from 0 to 2π. and likewise, this z is the linear distance of the point from the x-y plane. so similar to the cartesian coordinate, this z can vary from the minus infinity to the plus infinity. that means here, the range of the z is from minus infinity to the plus infinity. so in this way, in this cylindrical coordinate system, we have the coordinates rho, phi and the z. so now lets say, there is some point p in the 3d space. and now, starting from the origin, if we draw a vector that is connecting this point p, and that will be the position vector in the 3d space. so in the cylindrical coordinate system, if we represent this vector a, then it can be represented like this. where this small a rho, a phi and the az represents the unit vectors in the cylindrical coordinate system. and unlike the cartesian coordinate, these unit vectors wont always point in the same direction. and rather, their direction always depends on the position of the vector. so here, first of all, for the given point, lets find out the rho. so here, if we take the projection of this vector on the x-y plane, then we will get this rho. and now, if i draw the imaginary cylinder that is passing through the z-axis, then this will be its radius. so here, this distance represents the rho. so now, let me also draw the line that is parallel to this radius. so here, if you see the direction of this unit vector a rho, then it will be in the incremental direction of the rho. so this a rho is known as the radial unit vector. so at a given point, it is pointing in this direction. but suppose if the point changes, then the direction of this a rho will also change. so similarly, now lets see the direction of the a phi. so here, this angle represents the a phi. and as you can see over here, this phi is increasing in this direction. that means here, this unit vector a phi will also point in the direction in which this phi angle is increasing. so that will be in this direction. and if you see its direction, then it is tangent to the cylinder. and therefore, sometimes this vector is also known as the tangential vector. and likewise, the direction of the unit vector az will be parallel to the z-axis. so at this point if you see, then this a rho, a phi and the az are orthogonal to each other. that means here, all the three unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. so because of that, if we take the dot product of any two unit vectors, then that will be equal to zero. because in the earlier video of the dot product, we have seen that if the two unit vectors or in general if the two vectors are orthogonal to each other, then that dot product will remain zero. that means here, if we perform the a rho dot a phi or the a phi dot az, then that will be remain zero. and likewise, this az dot a rho will also be equal to zero. but on the other hand, if we perform the dot product with the unit vector itself, then that will be always 1. that means in this case, this a rho dot a rho will be 1. and likewise, this a phi dot a phi and the az dot az will also be equal to 1. that means the dot product of the unit vector with itself will be equal to 1. and likewise, if we perform the cross product between the two unit vectors in the cyclic order, then we will get the another unit vector. for example, if we perform the cross product between the a rho and the a phi, then we will get the az. so likewise, if we perform the a phi cross az, then we will get the a rho. and similarly, this az cross a rho will give us the a phi. so that is all about the unit vectors in the cylindrical coordinate system. so similarly, if you see this a rho, a phi and the az, then they are the components of the unit vector in the respective directions. so very soon, we shall see that how to find these components. but before that, first let us see, if we have been given one point in the cylindrical coordinate system, then how to convert it into the cartesian coordinate system. and vice versa, we will also see that if the point is given in the cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert it into the cylindrical coordinate system. because this conversion will be required for finding this a rho, a phi and the az. so to find that, first let us project this point on the xy plane. so here, this distance will be the z. so in this way, we will get our z coordinate. so as you can see over here, in both coordinate systems, the z component remains the same. so now, let us connect this point with the origin. so this distance represents the rho. and now, the angle that is made by this line with the x-axis represents the azimuth angle. that is equal to 5. so if we take the projection of this rho on the x-axis, then we will get the x component. so we can say that here the x is equal to rho cos phi. and likewise, if we take the projection on the y-axis, then we will get the y component. that is equal to rho sin phi. so from this, we can say that here this x is equal to rho cos phi, while the y is equal to rho sin phi. so in this way, for any given point, if we have been given the coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system, then using this formula, we can convert it into the cartesian coordinate system. so similarly, now let us see the other way around. and let us find out, suppose we have been given a point in the cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert that point in the cylindrical coordinate system. so we already know this relationship, right? that means here, during the cartesian-to-cylindrical conversion also, this z component will remain the same. so now, to find this rho, let us do the x-square plus y-square. so here, if we perform the x-square plus y-square, then we will get this rho-square cos-square phi plus rho-square sin-square phi. so if we take this rho-square outside, then we will have this sin-square phi plus cos-square phi. and that is equal to 1. so we can say that, here this x-square plus y-square is equal to rho-square. or we can say that, this rho is equal to square root of x-square plus y-square. and similarly, from this relationship, if we take the ratio of y and x, then we will get the tan phi. so if we take the inverse, then this azimuth angle phi can be given as tan-inverse of y by x. so in this way, if we have been given a point in the 3d space in the cartesian coordinate system, then using this relationship, we can find the corresponding cylindrical coordinates. then other way around, suppose we have been given the coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system, then using this relationship, we can find the corresponding cartesian coordinates. so now, once we know this coordinate conversion from the cartesian to cylindrical as well as the cylindrical to cartesian coordinate, then the next important thing, which we should know is the vector conversion. that means, suppose if we have been given the vector in the cartesian coordinate, then how to convert it into the cylindrical coordinates. and vice versa, suppose we have the vector in the cylindrical coordinates, then how to convert it back into the cartesian coordinates. so here, instead of directly applying the straightforward transformation, we will derive those expressions so that you have a better understanding about the process. so as a first step, what we will do, we will find the unit vector transformation. and we will see that how to convert the unit vectors from the cartesian coordinates to the cylindrical coordinates. and then after, we will see the other way around. so once we get that relation, then we will replace these unit vectors by that newly found expression. and with the help of it, we can find the relationship between the components ax, ay, az and the a row, a phi and the az. so as a first step, let us see the unit vector conversion. and let us see how to convert the unit vectors from the cartesian coordinates to the cylindrical coordinates. so for that, first let us take some point r in the cartesian coordinate. and lets say the position vector which is connecting this point is equal to r. so this position vector can be written as this x times ax plus y times ay plus z times az. because as you know, in the cartesian coordinates for the position vector, the components of the vector will be same as the coordinate values. so now, if you see over here, then what we need to find is, the unit vectors in the direction of the row phi and the z. and if you see this expression, then it does not contain any variables such as row phi and the z. so here, what we will do, we will replace this x, y and z with their corresponding cylindrical coordinates. and here, we can do that because this x, y and z indeed corresponds to the coordinate values. so now, if you see the expression of the position vector, then it is in the form of row phi and the z. so now, when we differentiate this vector with respect to the variable row, then we will get the vector which is incrementing in the direction of the row. and whenever we normalize it, then we will get the unit vector. so that vector is actually the a row. so if you recall, then earlier for the cylindrical coordinates, we have seen that these unit vectors a row, a phi and the az are pointing in the incremental direction of this row phi and the z. so thats why, here this term will also correspond to a row. likewise, if we differentiate this position vector r with respect to phi and normalize it, then we will get the unit vector a phi and likewise, we can also get the az. so now, first let us find this a row. so to find this a row, first let us differentiate this position vector with respect to row. so here, if you see this del r by del rho, then that will be equal to cos phi times ax plus sine phi times ay. and here, since this term does not contain any row variable, so that will become 0. and now, if we take its magnitude, then that will be equal to square root of cos square phi plus sine square phi and that is equal to 1. so we can say that here this unit vector a row is equal to cos phi times ax plus sine phi times ay. so in this way, here we got this unit vector a row in terms of the ax, ay and the az. so similarly, now let us find the unit vector a phi. so this a phi can be given as this del r divided by del phi divided by the magnitude of it. so here, if we differentiate this r with respect to phi, then we will get this minus rho times sine phi ax plus rho times this cos phi times ay. and once again, since the third term does not contain any variable phi, so it will become 0. so now, if we take its magnitude, then that will be equal to square root of rho square sine square phi plus rho square cos square phi. so here, if we take this rho square common, then we will have this sine square phi plus cos square phi and as you know that is equal to 1. so from this we can say that here this del r divided by del phi is equal to rho. and therefore, here this unit vector a phi is equal to minus sine phi times ax plus cos phi times ay. so similarly, now let us see the unit vector az. so once again, as per the definition, this az can be given as this del r divided by del z divided by its magnitude. so we know that in both cylindrical as well as the cartesian coordinates, the z coordinate remains the same. so thats why this az should also remain as it is. but here, let us also prove that. so here, this del r divided by del z will be equal to az. because if you see, then the first and the second term of this position vector does not contain any variable z. so thats why they will become 0. and for the third term, if we differentiate with respect to z, then we will get the az. and we know that the magnitude of the unit vector is same as the 1. so therefore, the az in the cylindrical coordinate system will be same as the cartesian coordinate system. and in this way, we got the unit vectors a rho, a phi and az in terms of the ax, ay and the az. so similarly, now let us see the other way around and let us find out the unit vectors ax, ay and az in terms of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. so here, since we already know this relationship, so we will find the unit vectors ax, ay and az with the help of the projection method. and in that, first we will find the unit vector ax. so in general, this unit vector ax can be expressed as the combination of these vectors a rho, a phi and the az, where here this 0, c phi and the cz are the projection of this unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az in the direction of the ax. that means here, this 0 is equal to this ax dot a rho. and as you know, it is nothing but the projection of the vector a rho in the direction of the ax. so here, since we already know the unit vector a rho in terms of the ax and ay, so we can easily perform this ax dot a rho. so here, if we perform this ax dot a rho, then we will get only this first term. because for the second term, this ax dot ay will become 0. that means here, this ax dot a rho is equal to cos phi. likewise, this c phi is equal to ax dot a phi and that is equal to minus sin phi. and similarly, this cz is equal to ax dot az and that is equal to 0. so from this, we can say that this ax is equal to this cos phi times a rho minus sin phi times a phi. so in this way, we got this unit vector ax in terms of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. so similarly, now let us find the unit vector ay. so once again, this unit vector ay can be expressed as the combination of these vectors a rho, a phi and the az. so here, this c rho is equal to ay dot a rho. and in this case, that will be equal to sin phi. likewise, if we perform this c phi, then that is equal to ay dot a phi. and in this case, that is equal to cos phi. and likewise, this cz will be equal to 0. so we can say that here this ay is equal to sin phi times a rho plus cos phi times a phi. and in this way, we also found the relationship between the unit vector ay in terms of the a rho, a phi and the az. so likewise, let us also see the az. so as we have seen, for the both coordinate system, the az remains the same. so based on this projection method also, we should get the same result. so as per this method, this az is equal to the combination of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. so here, this c rho will be equal to az dot a rho. and as you can see over here, as the a rho, a phi does not contain any z component, so it will be equal to 0. that means here, this first coefficient is equal to 0. and likewise, this c phi will also be equal to 0. and then, if we see this cz, then that is equal to az dot az. and as you know, that is equal to 1. that means in this case, this az will be equal to az. and that is the expected result, right? so in this way, we got the cartesian unit vectors in terms of the cylindrical unit vectors. and earlier, we already found the cylindrical unit vectors in terms of the cartesian unit vectors. so now, with the help of it, we can find the transformation between the coefficients ax, ay and az and the a rho, a phi and the az. so here, what we will do, first we will find the relationship between the components ax, ay and az in terms of the a rho, a phi and the az. so basically, here we will find the vector in the cartesian coordinate from the cylindrical coordinates. that means here, we already know the vector in the cylindrical coordinates. so that is equal to a rho times a rho plus a phi times a phi plus az times az. so now in this expression, let us put the values of the a rho, a phi and the az. so if we put the value, then we will get this expression. so if required, then you can pause the video and check this expression. so now from this expression, let us combine the terms which contains the unit vector ax. so if we combine that, then we will get this a rho times cos phi minus a phi times sin phi. similarly, let us combine the terms related to this ay. so if we do so, then we will get this a rho times sin phi plus a phi times cos phi. and likewise, the last term will be equal to az. so now, if we compare this expression with the cartesian vector, then the first term corresponds to ax. likewise, the second term corresponds to ay. and the last term will be equal to az. so from this, we can say that this ax is equal to this a rho times cos phi minus a phi times sin phi. likewise, this ay is equal to a rho times sin phi plus a phi times cos phi. and this third term az will remain as it is. so in this way, we found the relationship between the components ax, ay and az in terms of the cylindrical components. and here, the same thing can also be written in the matrix form. so this is the transformation matrix for converting the vector that is given to us in the cylindrical coordinate to the cartesian coordinate. so similarly, now let us see the other way around and let us find the cartesian to cylindrical conversion. that means now, the vector that is given to us is in the cartesian coordinate. so now in this expression, let us put the values of the ax, ay and the az. so if we put the value, then we will get this expression. so once again, if required, then you can pause the video. so now, from this expression, let us combine the terms related to a rho. so if we combine that, then we will get the term that is ax cos phi plus ay sin phi. similarly, let us combine the terms related to a phi. so if we combine those terms, then we will get minus ax sin phi plus ay cos phi. and likewise, the third term will remain as it is. so now, let us compare this expression with the vector expression that we want to find in the cylindrical coordinate system. that means here, this term corresponds to a rho and likewise, this term corresponds to a phi. so from this, we can say that over here, this a rho is equal to ax cos phi plus ay sin phi. and likewise, this a phi is equal to minus ax sin phi plus ay cos phi. and the az will remain as it is. so in this way, we also found the cylindrical vector components a rho, a phi and az in terms of the cartesian coordinates. and the same thing can also be written in the matrix form. so now, if you compare this matrix with the cylindrical to the cartesian convergence matrix, then we can find that by just taking the transpose of the given matrix. and vice versa, it is also possible. that means here, we just need to remember only one transformation matrix. and from that, we can easily write another one. so with the help of this transformation matrix, we can convert the vector from the cylindrical to the cartesian coordinates, as well as from the cartesian to the cylindrical coordinates. so earlier if you recall, then for the simplicity of the derivation, we have assumed that the given vector is the position vector. and we have assumed that the point in the cartesian coordinate is equal to x, y and z. so the corresponding position vector was x times ax plus y times ay plus z times az. that means in case of the cartesian coordinate, if we have the position vector, then the components of the unit vectors are same as the coordinate values. but that is not the case in case of the cylindrical coordinate system. so now, with the help of the transformation matrix, lets see what will be the expression of the given vector in the cylindrical coordinates. so we know that the vector components in the cylindrical coordinate system can be represented like this. so here, if you see this a rho, then that is equal to ax cos5 plus ay sin5. so in this case, this ax is equal to x, while the ay is equal to y. and moreover, we also know that this x is equal to rho cos5, while the y is equal to rho sin5. so if we put the values of x and y, then we will get this rho times cos2 5 plus rho times sin2 5. and as you know, this cos2 5 plus sin2 5 is equal to 1. so we can say that this a rho is equal to rho. so similarly, lets find the a5. so as per this transformation matrix, this a5 can be given as minus ax sin5 plus ay cos5. so once again, if we put the values of the ax and ay, then this a5 expression can be written as minus x sin5 plus y cos5. so once again, we know that here this x is equal to rho cos5, while the y is equal to rho sin5. so if we put these values, then this a5 will be equal to minus rho times cos5 times sin5 plus rho times sin5 times cos5. so as you can see over here, both these terms will get cancelled out. and therefore, this a5 will come out as zero. so in this way, we also got the second term. and as you can see, this az will be same as az. so in this way, we got all the components. and from this, we can say that this vector a is equal to rho times a rho plus z times az. so in this way, with the help of this transformation matrix, we can convert any vector that is given to us in the cartesian coordinate to the cylindrical coordinate. and if we take the transpose of this matrix, then we will get the relationship between the ax, ay and az in terms of the a rho, a5 and az. so in this way, in this video, we learned about the cylindrical coordinate system. and we understood that how to convert the point that is given to us in the cartesian coordinate to the cylindrical coordinates. and we have also seen the other way around. and then after, we also understood the vector conversion between the two coordinate systems. so in the next video, similarly, we will learn about the spherical coordinate system. and we will also see the vector conversion between the cartesian and the spherical coordinate system. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the

the earlier videos of the electromagnetic theory, we understood about the vector algebra. so now in this video, and in the upcoming videos, we will learn about the different coordinate systems. so the first question that comes to in our mind is like, what is the point of learning these different coordinate systems in the electromagnetic theory, right? so the reason is that, if you see the real-world examples in the electromagnetics, then the different objects have the certain symmetry. for example, if you take the case of the parallel plate capacitors or the circuit board traces, then they have the planar symmetry. so while dealing with such objects, it is easy to define the electric and magnetic fields in the cartesian coordinate. and in fact, it also becomes easy to solve the maxwell equations as well as the boundary conditions in the cartesian coordinate. but on the other hand, if you see the coaxial cables or the long wires, then they have the axial symmetry. so for such objects, when we are defining the electric fields or solving the maxwell equations, then it is easy to represent them in the cylindrical coordinate system. so when we define them in their suitable coordinate system, then what happens is that many variables can get eliminated. so because of that, the representation of the vectors as well as solving the maxwell equation becomes easy. and the same is the case when we represent the point charge or dealing with the antennas, because they have the spherical symmetry. so in such cases, it is better to represent the electric field in the spherical coordinate and suppose if the electric and magnetic fields are not known in the suitable coordinate system, then we can also convert them in the suitable coordinate system. so along with the knowledge of the coordinate system, we should also know that how to convert the field vectors, which is given in the one coordinate system into another coordinate system. so if we know that, then based on the symmetry, sometimes very complex looking equations can be simplified to the very simple form. so during this video, we will see the cylindrical coordinate system. and we will also learn that how to convert the vectors, which is given in the one coordinate system into another coordinate system. so as you are rightly imaging, this video will have a lot of mathematical expressions. but once we understand it clearly, then in the upcoming videos, it will become very easy to understand the different electromagnetic concepts. alright, so now in the earlier videos, while discussing the vector algebra, we have already discussed the cartesian coordinate system. so in the cartesian coordinate system, if we have some point p in the 3d space, then it can be defined by its three coordinates x, y and z, where this x, y and z represents the distance of this point p from the origin in the respective direction. so similarly, we have also seen that, how to represent any vector in the cartesian coordinate. so here, these ax, ay and az are the unit vectors in the direction of x, y and z. and likewise, these capital a x, ay and az are the components of the vector in the x, y and z direction respectively. now if you see the unit vectors in the cartesian coordinate, then that direction always remains fixed irrespective of the position of the vectors. that means even if the position of the vector changes, then also, the direction of these unit vectors in the cartesian coordinate always remains fixed. that means here, the ax will always remain in this direction. and likewise, the ay and az will always point in respective directions. but that is not the case in case of the cylindrical as well as the spherical coordinate system. so if you see the cylindrical and the spherical coordinate system, then they are the curvilinear coordinate system. but this cartesian coordinate system is the rectilinear. that means if we keep the two axes constant, and changes the another one, then you will move in the straight direction. for example, if we keep the x and z coordinates constant, and changes the y coordinate, then we will move in the straight line. that means in this cartesian coordinate, the direction of the unit vectors always remains fixed. but that is not the case in case of the cylindrical as well as the spherical coordinate system. so to understand that, first in this video, let us learn about this cylindrical coordinate system. so we know that, in case of the cartesian coordinate system, we have the three coordinates x, y and z. so similarly, in the cylindrical coordinate system, we have the rho, phi and the z. so to understand what is this rho, just imagine a cylinder that is centered around the z-axis. so this rho represents the radius of this cylinder. so in this cylindrical coordinate system, this rho can increase from 0 to infinity. so we can say that, here the range of the rho is from 0 to infinity. so similarly, this phi represents the azimuth angle. so here, this azimuth angle phi is the angle that is made by the radius with the x-axis. so here, this phi can vary from 0 to 2π. so we can say that, the range of the angle phi is from 0 to 2π. and likewise, this z is the linear distance of the point from the x-y plane. so similar to the cartesian coordinate, this z can vary from the minus infinity to the plus infinity. that means here, the range of the z is from minus infinity to the plus infinity. so in this way, in this cylindrical coordinate system, we have the coordinates rho, phi and the z. so now lets say, there is some point p in the 3d space. and now, starting from the origin, if we draw a vector that is connecting this point p, and that will be the position vector in the 3d space. so in the cylindrical coordinate system, if we represent this vector a, then it can be represented like this. where this small a rho, a phi and the az represents the unit vectors in the cylindrical coordinate system. and unlike the cartesian coordinate, these unit vectors wont always point in the same direction. and rather, their direction always depends on the position of the vector. so here, first of all, for the given point, lets find out the rho. so here, if we take the projection of this vector on the x-y plane, then we will get this rho. and now, if i draw the imaginary cylinder that is passing through the z-axis, then this will be its radius. so here, this distance represents the rho. so now, let me also draw the line that is parallel to this radius. so here, if you see the direction of this unit vector a rho, then it will be in the incremental direction of the rho. so this a rho is known as the radial unit vector. so at a given point, it is pointing in this direction. but suppose if the point changes, then the direction of this a rho will also change. so similarly, now lets see the direction of the a phi. so here, this angle represents the a phi. and as you can see over here, this phi is increasing in this direction. that means here, this unit vector a phi will also point in the direction in which this phi angle is increasing. so that will be in this direction. and if you see its direction, then it is tangent to the cylinder. and therefore, sometimes this vector is also known as the tangential vector. and likewise, the direction of the unit vector az will be parallel to the z-axis. so at this point if you see, then this a rho, a phi and the az are orthogonal to each other. that means here, all the three unit vectors are perpendicular to each other. so because of that, if we take the dot product of any two unit vectors, then that will be equal to zero. because in the earlier video of the dot product, we have seen that if the two unit vectors or in general if the two vectors are orthogonal to each other, then that dot product will remain zero. that means here, if we perform the a rho dot a phi or the a phi dot az, then that will be remain zero. and likewise, this az dot a rho will also be equal to zero. but on the other hand, if we perform the dot product with the unit vector itself, then that will be always 1. that means in this case, this a rho dot a rho will be 1. and likewise, this a phi dot a phi and the az dot az will also be equal to 1. that means the dot product of the unit vector with itself will be equal to 1. and likewise, if we perform the cross product between the two unit vectors in the cyclic order, then we will get the another unit vector. for example, if we perform the cross product between the a rho and the a phi, then we will get the az. so likewise, if we perform the a phi cross az, then we will get the a rho. and similarly, this az cross a rho will give us the a phi. so that is all about the unit vectors in the cylindrical coordinate system. so similarly, if you see this a rho, a phi and the az, then they are the components of the unit vector in the respective directions. so very soon, we shall see that how to find these components. but before that, first let us see, if we have been given one point in the cylindrical coordinate system, then how to convert it into the cartesian coordinate system. and vice versa, we will also see that if the point is given in the cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert it into the cylindrical coordinate system. because this conversion will be required for finding this a rho, a phi and the az. so to find that, first let us project this point on the xy plane. so here, this distance will be the z. so in this way, we will get our z coordinate. so as you can see over here, in both coordinate systems, the z component remains the same. so now, let us connect this point with the origin. so this distance represents the rho. and now, the angle that is made by this line with the x-axis represents the azimuth angle. that is equal to 5. so if we take the projection of this rho on the x-axis, then we will get the x component. so we can say that here the x is equal to rho cos phi. and likewise, if we take the projection on the y-axis, then we will get the y component. that is equal to rho sin phi. so from this, we can say that here this x is equal to rho cos phi, while the y is equal to rho sin phi. so in this way, for any given point, if we have been given the coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system, then using this formula, we can convert it into the cartesian coordinate system. so similarly, now let us see the other way around. and let us find out, suppose we have been given a point in the cartesian coordinate system, then how to convert that point in the cylindrical coordinate system. so we already know this relationship, right? that means here, during the cartesian-to-cylindrical conversion also, this z component will remain the same. so now, to find this rho, let us do the x-square plus y-square. so here, if we perform the x-square plus y-square, then we will get this rho-square cos-square phi plus rho-square sin-square phi. so if we take this rho-square outside, then we will have this sin-square phi plus cos-square phi. and that is equal to 1. so we can say that, here this x-square plus y-square is equal to rho-square. or we can say that, this rho is equal to square root of x-square plus y-square. and similarly, from this relationship, if we take the ratio of y and x, then we will get the tan phi. so if we take the inverse, then this azimuth angle phi can be given as tan-inverse of y by x. so in this way, if we have been given a point in the 3d space in the cartesian coordinate system, then using this relationship, we can find the corresponding cylindrical coordinates. then other way around, suppose we have been given the coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system, then using this relationship, we can find the corresponding cartesian coordinates. so now, once we know this coordinate conversion from the cartesian to cylindrical as well as the cylindrical to cartesian coordinate, then the next important thing, which we should know is the vector conversion. that means, suppose if we have been given the vector in the cartesian coordinate, then how to convert it into the cylindrical coordinates. and vice versa, suppose we have the vector in the cylindrical coordinates, then how to convert it back into the cartesian coordinates. so here, instead of directly applying the straightforward transformation, we will derive those expressions so that you have a better understanding about the process. so as a first step, what we will do, we will find the unit vector transformation. and we will see that how to convert the unit vectors from the cartesian coordinates to the cylindrical coordinates. and then after, we will see the other way around. so once we get that relation, then we will replace these unit vectors by that newly found expression. and with the help of it, we can find the relationship between the components ax, ay, az and the a row, a phi and the az. so as a first step, let us see the unit vector conversion. and let us see how to convert the unit vectors from the cartesian coordinates to the cylindrical coordinates. so for that, first let us take some point r in the cartesian coordinate. and lets say the position vector which is connecting this point is equal to r. so this position vector can be written as this x times ax plus y times ay plus z times az. because as you know, in the cartesian coordinates for the position vector, the components of the vector will be same as the coordinate values. so now, if you see over here, then what we need to find is, the unit vectors in the direction of the row phi and the z. and if you see this expression, then it does not contain any variables such as row phi and the z. so here, what we will do, we will replace this x, y and z with their corresponding cylindrical coordinates. and here, we can do that because this x, y and z indeed corresponds to the coordinate values. so now, if you see the expression of the position vector, then it is in the form of row phi and the z. so now, when we differentiate this vector with respect to the variable row, then we will get the vector which is incrementing in the direction of the row. and whenever we normalize it, then we will get the unit vector. so that vector is actually the a row. so if you recall, then earlier for the cylindrical coordinates, we have seen that these unit vectors a row, a phi and the az are pointing in the incremental direction of this row phi and the z. so thats why, here this term will also correspond to a row. likewise, if we differentiate this position vector r with respect to phi and normalize it, then we will get the unit vector a phi and likewise, we can also get the az. so now, first let us find this a row. so to find this a row, first let us differentiate this position vector with respect to row. so here, if you see this del r by del rho, then that will be equal to cos phi times ax plus sine phi times ay. and here, since this term does not contain any row variable, so that will become 0. and now, if we take its magnitude, then that will be equal to square root of cos square phi plus sine square phi and that is equal to 1. so we can say that here this unit vector a row is equal to cos phi times ax plus sine phi times ay. so in this way, here we got this unit vector a row in terms of the ax, ay and the az. so similarly, now let us find the unit vector a phi. so this a phi can be given as this del r divided by del phi divided by the magnitude of it. so here, if we differentiate this r with respect to phi, then we will get this minus rho times sine phi ax plus rho times this cos phi times ay. and once again, since the third term does not contain any variable phi, so it will become 0. so now, if we take its magnitude, then that will be equal to square root of rho square sine square phi plus rho square cos square phi. so here, if we take this rho square common, then we will have this sine square phi plus cos square phi and as you know that is equal to 1. so from this we can say that here this del r divided by del phi is equal to rho. and therefore, here this unit vector a phi is equal to minus sine phi times ax plus cos phi times ay. so similarly, now let us see the unit vector az. so once again, as per the definition, this az can be given as this del r divided by del z divided by its magnitude. so we know that in both cylindrical as well as the cartesian coordinates, the z coordinate remains the same. so thats why this az should also remain as it is. but here, let us also prove that. so here, this del r divided by del z will be equal to az. because if you see, then the first and the second term of this position vector does not contain any variable z. so thats why they will become 0. and for the third term, if we differentiate with respect to z, then we will get the az. and we know that the magnitude of the unit vector is same as the 1. so therefore, the az in the cylindrical coordinate system will be same as the cartesian coordinate system. and in this way, we got the unit vectors a rho, a phi and az in terms of the ax, ay and the az. so similarly, now let us see the other way around and let us find out the unit vectors ax, ay and az in terms of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. so here, since we already know this relationship, so we will find the unit vectors ax, ay and az with the help of the projection method. and in that, first we will find the unit vector ax. so in general, this unit vector ax can be expressed as the combination of these vectors a rho, a phi and the az, where here this 0, c phi and the cz are the projection of this unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az in the direction of the ax. that means here, this 0 is equal to this ax dot a rho. and as you know, it is nothing but the projection of the vector a rho in the direction of the ax. so here, since we already know the unit vector a rho in terms of the ax and ay, so we can easily perform this ax dot a rho. so here, if we perform this ax dot a rho, then we will get only this first term. because for the second term, this ax dot ay will become 0. that means here, this ax dot a rho is equal to cos phi. likewise, this c phi is equal to ax dot a phi and that is equal to minus sin phi. and similarly, this cz is equal to ax dot az and that is equal to 0. so from this, we can say that this ax is equal to this cos phi times a rho minus sin phi times a phi. so in this way, we got this unit vector ax in terms of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. so similarly, now let us find the unit vector ay. so once again, this unit vector ay can be expressed as the combination of these vectors a rho, a phi and the az. so here, this c rho is equal to ay dot a rho. and in this case, that will be equal to sin phi. likewise, if we perform this c phi, then that is equal to ay dot a phi. and in this case, that is equal to cos phi. and likewise, this cz will be equal to 0. so we can say that here this ay is equal to sin phi times a rho plus cos phi times a phi. and in this way, we also found the relationship between the unit vector ay in terms of the a rho, a phi and the az. so likewise, let us also see the az. so as we have seen, for the both coordinate system, the az remains the same. so based on this projection method also, we should get the same result. so as per this method, this az is equal to the combination of the unit vectors a rho, a phi and the az. so here, this c rho will be equal to az dot a rho. and as you can see over here, as the a rho, a phi does not contain any z component, so it will be equal to 0. that means here, this first coefficient is equal to 0. and likewise, this c phi will also be equal to 0. and then, if we see this cz, then that is equal to az dot az. and as you know, that is equal to 1. that means in this case, this az will be equal to az. and that is the expected result, right? so in this way, we got the cartesian unit vectors in terms of the cylindrical unit vectors. and earlier, we already found the cylindrical unit vectors in terms of the cartesian unit vectors. so now, with the help of it, we can find the transformation between the coefficients ax, ay and az and the a rho, a phi and the az. so here, what we will do, first we will find the relationship between the components ax, ay and az in terms of the a rho, a phi and the az. so basically, here we will find the vector in the cartesian coordinate from the cylindrical coordinates. that means here, we already know the vector in the cylindrical coordinates. so that is equal to a rho times a rho plus a phi times a phi plus az times az. so now in this expression, let us put the values of the a rho, a phi and the az. so if we put the value, then we will get this expression. so if required, then you can pause the video and check this expression. so now from this expression, let us combine the terms which contains the unit vector ax. so if we combine that, then we will get this a rho times cos phi minus a phi times sin phi. similarly, let us combine the terms related to this ay. so if we do so, then we will get this a rho times sin phi plus a phi times cos phi. and likewise, the last term will be equal to az. so now, if we compare this expression with the cartesian vector, then the first term corresponds to ax. likewise, the second term corresponds to ay. and the last term will be equal to az. so from this, we can say that this ax is equal to this a rho times cos phi minus a phi times sin phi. likewise, this ay is equal to a rho times sin phi plus a phi times cos phi. and this third term az will remain as it is. so in this way, we found the relationship between the components ax, ay and az in terms of the cylindrical components. and here, the same thing can also be written in the matrix form. so this is the transformation matrix for converting the vector that is given to us in the cylindrical coordinate to the cartesian coordinate. so similarly, now let us see the other way around and let us find the cartesian to cylindrical conversion. that means now, the vector that is given to us is in the cartesian coordinate. so now in this expression, let us put the values of the ax, ay and the az. so if we put the value, then we will get this expression. so once again, if required, then you can pause the video. so now, from this expression, let us combine the terms related to a rho. so if we combine that, then we will get the term that is ax cos phi plus ay sin phi. similarly, let us combine the terms related to a phi. so if we combine those terms, then we will get minus ax sin phi plus ay cos phi. and likewise, the third term will remain as it is. so now, let us compare this expression with the vector expression that we want to find in the cylindrical coordinate system. that means here, this term corresponds to a rho and likewise, this term corresponds to a phi. so from this, we can say that over here, this a rho is equal to ax cos phi plus ay sin phi. and likewise, this a phi is equal to minus ax sin phi plus ay cos phi. and the az will remain as it is. so in this way, we also found the cylindrical vector components a rho, a phi and az in terms of the cartesian coordinates. and the same thing can also be written in the matrix form. so now, if you compare this matrix with the cylindrical to the cartesian convergence matrix, then we can find that by just taking the transpose of the given matrix. and vice versa, it is also possible. that means here, we just need to remember only one transformation matrix. and from that, we can easily write another one. so with the help of this transformation matrix, we can convert the vector from the cylindrical to the cartesian coordinates, as well as from the cartesian to the cylindrical coordinates. so earlier if you recall, then for the simplicity of the derivation, we have assumed that the given vector is the position vector. and we have assumed that the point in the cartesian coordinate is equal to x, y and z. so the corresponding position vector was x times ax plus y times ay plus z times az. that means in case of the cartesian coordinate, if we have the position vector, then the components of the unit vectors are same as the coordinate values. but that is not the case in case of the cylindrical coordinate system. so now, with the help of the transformation matrix, lets see what will be the expression of the given vector in the cylindrical coordinates. so we know that the vector components in the cylindrical coordinate system can be represented like this. so here, if you see this a rho, then that is equal to ax cos5 plus ay sin5. so in this case, this ax is equal to x, while the ay is equal to y. and moreover, we also know that this x is equal to rho cos5, while the y is equal to rho sin5. so if we put the values of x and y, then we will get this rho times cos2 5 plus rho times sin2 5. and as you know, this cos2 5 plus sin2 5 is equal to 1. so we can say that this a rho is equal to rho. so similarly, lets find the a5. so as per this transformation matrix, this a5 can be given as minus ax sin5 plus ay cos5. so once again, if we put the values of the ax and ay, then this a5 expression can be written as minus x sin5 plus y cos5. so once again, we know that here this x is equal to rho cos5, while the y is equal to rho sin5. so if we put these values, then this a5 will be equal to minus rho times cos5 times sin5 plus rho times sin5 times cos5. so as you can see over here, both these terms will get cancelled out. and therefore, this a5 will come out as zero. so in this way, we also got the second term. and as you can see, this az will be same as az. so in this way, we got all the components. and from this, we can say that this vector a is equal to rho times a rho plus z times az. so in this way, with the help of this transformation matrix, we can convert any vector that is given to us in the cartesian coordinate to the cylindrical coordinate. and if we take the transpose of this matrix, then we will get the relationship between the ax, ay and az in terms of the a rho, a5 and az. so in this way, in this video, we learned about the cylindrical coordinate system. and we understood that how to convert the point that is given to us in the cartesian coordinate to the cylindrical coordinates. and we have also seen the other way around. and then after, we also understood the vector conversion between the two coordinate systems. so in the

QiJYv4hHcLY,What is Virtual Ground in Op-Amp ? Why Virtual Ground Concept exist in Op-Amp?,2025-12-09 17:52:45+00:00,2025,12,Tuesday,"In this short video, let us understand what  is the virtual ground concept in the op-amp and   why this concept exist. And let us also learn under  what conditions this concept is not applicable. So   in the Op-amp, this virtual ground means, at a specific  node of the Op-amp circuit the voltage is equal to 0   volt despite it is not directly connected to the  ground potential. And this concept is applicable   when the op-amp has a very high open-loop gain and  it is used with the negative feedback. So as   per this concept, when the non-inverting terminal  of the op-amp is connected to the ground potential   then because of the very high gain of the op-amp,  the voltage at the inverting terminal will also   get forced to the same voltage level. So now let  us understand why it happens. So as you know in   general for the op-amp, its output voltage is equal to  its open-loop gain times the difference between the   two input terminals. Where this AOL is the open-loop  gain. So for the ideal op-amp, this open-loop gain is   infinite but for the actual op-amp it will be in  the range of 10 ^ 5 to the 10 ^ 6. Likewise,   this V+ is the voltage at the non-inverting  terminal. And similarly, this V- is the   voltage at the inverting terminal. So from  this, we can say that the difference between   the two input terminals is equal to Vout divided by AOL. And since the open loop gain is very high,   so this term will be close to zero. So we can  say that this V+ is equal to V-. So   if the non-inverting terminal is connected to the  ground potential then the voltage at the inverting   terminal will be also forced to the 0 volt,  despite it is not directly connected to the ground   potential. And that is why this concept is known as  the virtual ground concept. So for the ideal op-amp,   since it has the infinite open-loop gain so this  concept is applicable whenever it is used with the   negative feedback. But for the actual op-amp, as I  said this concept is applicable when the open-loop   gain of the op-amp is very high and it is used with  the negative feedback. But along with that the   Op-amp should be also used in the linear region. So  if all these three condition get satisfied then   only this concept is applicable in the practical  Op-amps. So this is the transfer characteristic or   the input output characteristic of the op-amp.  So whenever the op-amp is used with the feedback   then depending on the closed loop gain, this slope  will change but as you know for the actual Op-amps   the output cannot increase indefinitely and it  will get restricted by its biasing voltage. So   typically for the Op-amps, its output voltage will get  saturated before its biasing voltage. That means   in this transfer characteristic, on the either side  we will have the saturation voltage. So even with   the negative feedback, if the output of the op-amp  gets saturated then this virtual ground concept   is not applicable. So let us see that with one  example. So let's say we have one op-amp which is   used in the inverting configuration. So for this  configuration this virtual ground concept is   applicable whenever its closed loop gain times the  input voltage is less than the saturation voltage. Or   in this case, that is equal to this (- RF / R1) times   Vin is less than the saturation voltage. So if this   condition gets satisfied then only the virtual  ground concept is applicable. So for example   let's say the saturation voltage of the given op-amp  is equal to ± 5 volt and let's say this feedback   resistor is equal to 10 kilo-ohm while the value  of the R1 is equal to 1 kilo-ohm and moreover   let's say its input wtage is equal to 2 volt. So  here as per this equation the output voltage will   become - 20 volt and clearly as you can see,  it is beyond the saturation voltage. So therefore   here the output will get capped to the -15 volt. And in this case now the voltage at the inverting terminal will not be same as the 0 volt. So it can be easily found by applying the KCL at this   inverting node. And if you further simplify it  then this will be the expression for the V-.   So now in this expression if you put the value of  the Rf, Vin as well as the Vout, then this V-  will come out as 0.45 volt. So as you can see here  this virtual ground concept is not applicable and   as I said before, this concept is applicable  when these three condition gets satisfied.",what is virtual ground in op-amp ?

satisfied.",-0.0044746073,-0.007004246,0.02454954,0.038828336,-0.009227731,-0.046435203,0.0059609027,0.031402472,0.14312501,-0.01136314,0.009286391,0.019097136,0.014675804,-0.06627783,-0.0003150337,0.03969923,0.037455507,0.03553144,0.04640091,0.03527742,0.06664232,-0.018886324,0.03297591,-0.074251354,-0.020891597,0.0017003163,-0.16219324,0.020728033,0.00687022,-0.060144253,-0.009011164,0.026129708,0.116166994,0.02407904,-0.015879678,0.037950147,0.014009462,0.009865081,0.03929326,0.11099492,-0.00014311174,0.022963133,0.04608697,-0.03322398,-0.027231053,-0.020416705,0.019334825,-0.08253167,-0.047563907,-0.014634378,0.035362374,-0.022149561,-0.07128965,0.025727069,-0.030137502,0.051656816,0.03622819,0.047248073,-0.05294823,-0.012890684,0.0670872,0.059288498,-0.060592923,-0.028617354,0.016958717,-0.1092825,0.06607769,0.0012740662,-0.020681938,-0.07470071,-0.054585367,0.05160225,-0.001861969,-0.0965932,0.009867183,0.024133567,-0.089364775,0.032950714,0.017500712,0.067555845,0.13625975,0.054251444,-0.035823837,-0.08880044,-0.0842449,0.0257137,0.018522762,-0.016807465,0.08188943,0.0058556073,-0.035764866,-0.021369195,-0.09020927,0.05029644,0.07912922,-6.515179e-05,0.0023180433,-0.024035003,0.019427061,0.08209514,0.046799112,-0.040693697,0.027558357,-0.029625969,0.047505517,0.039000455,-0.010650156,-0.006990843,-0.03573202,-0.02101425,-0.008884607,-0.06096188,0.10714906,-0.04503658,-0.056053117,0.057112742,0.026345985,0.014323391,0.024978805,-0.10919046,-0.041475225,-0.024154413,0.013434387,0.033822786,0.011865879,-0.09424764,0.0049391557,7.6799353e-34,-0.00030586388,-0.022427326,0.11856883,-0.0725847,-0.0010855224,-0.09760742,-0.051851973,-0.042147044,-0.046156265,0.0048786164,0.018779153,0.0009681086,0.08072935,0.07422132,0.0014367257,0.07974476,-0.058990076,-0.0038242657,0.019774856,0.030206334,0.11467083,-0.028809264,-0.029146658,0.06366036,-0.012806326,-0.019166254,0.002498877,0.023819868,-0.106967464,-0.016511511,-0.059289616,0.103680305,0.058175292,0.0014698256,-0.0052520907,0.044995673,0.09920823,-0.05634805,0.0014434917,0.044241767,-0.008464925,-0.03151449,-0.0060138684,0.08267053,0.015716685,-0.02390557,-0.00036782818,-0.019150054,-0.062068034,0.035908535,-0.043343466,-0.045389455,-0.06822674,0.0013802694,-0.06630161,-0.00011513254,0.0018256544,0.10310351,-0.004518201,0.111892976,-0.0037966473,-0.022202635,-0.010843868,-0.0153656425,-0.10532393,0.003065295,0.008461044,-0.15886225,0.057164952,0.015140943,-0.008913877,0.080119394,-0.039607927,-0.08180749,0.0076372474,-0.018792018,-0.03641751,-0.0146363685,0.034945946,0.04182718,0.044930235,-0.043422192,-0.065845564,-0.030868445,-0.028831176,-0.04428941,0.035214122,-0.022467334,0.025421528,-0.037003234,-0.016074933,0.011728438,-0.0057215365,-0.023792658,0.09970542,-1.7628369e-33,0.049320627,0.029558929,-0.10537112,-0.012397999,0.022894109,0.045041773,-0.02851084,-0.027107583,-0.085559085,-0.049036898,-0.12579581,0.051670372,0.05134591,0.14900477,-0.03242408,-0.06644806,-0.017070567,-0.017316908,-0.031346172,0.054695122,0.06646865,0.11446924,-0.021602318,0.04325139,0.027242016,-0.047143713,-0.039946992,0.043589972,-0.049969673,0.051629245,0.03942798,0.056192912,-0.014690448,-0.040247533,-0.02519427,0.10802365,-0.048366934,-0.06443327,0.032094326,0.03839429,-0.032202426,-0.07288223,0.07244086,-0.06607974,-0.02234544,-0.037747063,-0.0021909946,0.08409463,0.049944002,-0.09964517,-0.02073855,-0.0033130061,-0.033160303,-0.008372923,-6.983214e-05,0.006434643,-0.04910383,0.03749354,0.015873063,0.029080553,-0.010191724,0.055018388,-0.013792051,0.029362079,-0.032555208,0.044355586,-0.018970711,-0.035748,0.018505717,-0.01464367,-0.04319546,-0.0015173762,-0.0072417306,-0.022121973,0.017444152,-0.0070064804,-0.0002659484,0.019519102,-0.0536247,0.03373596,-0.039282605,0.057010237,0.05865036,0.05495337,-0.061495144,0.031576008,-0.07367057,0.05868806,-0.052477725,0.052384805,0.034167692,-0.024744494,-0.08137008,0.03025918,-0.002709705,-4.6747708e-08,0.011363513,0.030040555,-0.032339554,0.048809007,0.036268603,0.033861794,0.09674292,-0.058798816,0.04149763,0.027620664,-0.023187961,-0.015554436,-0.06395976,-0.033801302,0.06640826,0.09987487,-0.054870706,0.061687328,-0.007674152,0.07825079,-0.008853405,-0.004098765,-0.00021708816,-0.04021896,0.054875545,0.00452596,0.02421018,0.007404084,-0.012411532,0.052445285,0.09234414,0.031311397,-0.10153377,0.01585993,-0.030939933,0.015721275,-0.007059828,0.03166231,-0.050943393,-0.10738653,-0.04543971,-0.050866745,0.050584804,-0.0621847,-0.060807656,0.10991011,-0.02744185,-0.0034464537,0.02771714,-0.04456289,-0.037218925,0.012587795,-0.08543198,0.042842053,-0.050358187,-0.009682557,-0.014643021,-0.015731156,0.0288283,0.035622686,-0.050781153,0.010313745,0.06320872,0.015653081
Fk49H5xS_h0,Interesting thing about XOR and XNOR gates you should know !! #digitalelectronics,2025-11-30 16:38:52+00:00,2025,11,Sunday,"In this short video, let us learn one interesting thing about the X or gate and the XNOR gates. So we know that in the two input X or gate, the output is high when both inputs are different. And based on that, this is the expression of the two input X or gate and it is represented as a X or B. Similarly, if you see the two input X or gate, then its output is high when both inputs are same. And accordingly this is the expression of the two input XNOR gate and it can be represented as this a X nor B. So looking at the truth table of these two input X or gate and the XNOR gate clearly we can say that this A X nor B is equal to A X or B whole bar. But the same relation does not hold true for the three inputs. So let us understand that. So for the three input X or gate its output is high when the odd number of inputs are high and this output can be expressed as this A X or B X or C. On the other end the output of the three input XOR get will be high when the even number of inputs are high. So obviously it can be expressed as this a X or B X or C whole bar and that is also evident from the root table. But now the interesting thing is that we cannot revision this X nor get output as this A X nor B X nor C. So let us also prove that. So here this A X nor B X nor C can also be implemented using the two input XNOR gates. Right? So based on this let us evaluate the truth table of this A X or B XR C. So once again as I said let's say the output of the first XNOR gate is equal to P. So this P output will be high when both inputs A and B are same. And now this output will be the one of the input to the second XNOR gate. So now the output of the second XNOR gate will be high and both inputs P and C are same. That means now if we compare this to truth table with the truth table of the three input XNOR gate then clearly as you can see they are not equal and in fact they are complement to each other. So if you closely observe then the truth table of this a x nor bx nor c is same as the truth table of the ax or bx or c. That means we can say that the output of the three input XNOR gate is not same as the A X nor B X nor C. But further if we go for the four input XNOR gate then once again that holds true. So in short from all this we can say that for this XNOR gate and the number of inputs are even then this relation holds true and whenever the number of inputs are odd then this relation does not hold. So that is the interesting thing about the hexorg gate.",interesting thing about xor and xnor gates you should know !! digitalelectronics,"in this short video, let us learn one interesting thing about

tWyPuCbYLUg,"Solved Problems on Vectors, Vector Algebra and Vector Fields | Electromagnetic Theory",2025-11-06 15:10:54+00:00,2025,11,Thursday,"[music] Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel All About Electronics. So in the previous video we understood that what is vectors and then after we understood that how the vector addition and the subtraction can be done and then after we also understood the concept of the vector fields. So in this video let us see some solve problems based on the concepts that we learned in the previous video. So here the first example is based on the vectors. So here in the first example we have been given the three points that is mn and the p in the cartisian coordinate. So here first we have been asked to find the addition of the vector rn plus rmpp. So in the cartisian coordinate system let's say there is some point m and there is a some point n. So from the origin if you draw a vector towards the point m then that will be a position vector rm. Similarly if you draw a vector from the origin towards the point n then that will be a position vector rn. So here if you see this vector RMN then that is basically a position vector that is the vector that is drawn from the point M towards the point N and mathematically it can be represented as this vector RMN that is equal to this RN minus RM and in the previous video we already understood that how to represent this displacement vector right so Here this vector Rn can be represented as this 3 ax minus 3 a y + 0 az and similarly this vector rm can be given as - ax + 2 a y + a z. So now this vector RMN is equal to this Rn minus RM. So here we will do this subtraction component wise. So we can say that this RN - RM is equal to 3 - -1 * a X + - - 3 - 2 * A Y + 0 - 1 * A Z. That means here this vector rmn is equal to this 4 ax minus 5 a y minus a z. So in this way we got this vector rmn. So similarly let us find this vector rmp. So for that we also need the position vector rp. So here this position vector RP can be given as - 2 ax - 3 a y - 4 az and here this vector rmp can be given as this vector rp minus rm and once again that can be found by doing the subtraction of this vector rp and the rm component wise. So we can say that that is equal to - 2 - -1 * a x + -3 - 2 * a y + -4 -1 * a z. So that is equal to - a x - 5 a y - 5 az. So in this way we got this vector RMP and here as you can see we have been asked to find the addition of this vector RMP and the RMN. That means here this RMP plus RMN is equal to the addition of these two vectors. So once again we can find that by doing the component wise addition. That means here for these two vectors we will add their x, y and the z components respectively. That means here this rmp + rmn is equal to this 4 -1 * a x + - 5 - 5 * a y + - -1 - 5 * a z. So that is equal to 3 a x - 10 a y - 6 a z. So in this way we got the addition of these two distance vector. So apart from that here we have been also asked to find the magnitude of this 2 rp minus 3 rn. So let us find that. So here we know that this RP is equal to - 2 A X - 3 A Y - 4 A Z and similarly we know that this RN can be given as this 3 X - 3 A Y that means here this 2 RP minus 3 RN is equal to these two times - 2 a x - 3 a y - 4 a zus 3 * these 3 ax - 3 a y. So here let us add the x y and the z components separately. That means here if you further simplify it then we will get - 4 - 9 * a x + - - 6 + 9 * a y + - - 8 * a z. So that is equal to -3 * a x + 3 a y - 8 a z. So in this way we got this vector 2 RP minus 3 Rn. So now we need to find the magnitude of this vector. So in general we know that the magnitude of any vector a can be given as the square root of the ax² plus a y² + az² where the ax a y and the az are the x y and the z component of the given vector. So in this case the magnitude of this 2 RP minus 3 RN is equal to the square root of - 13² + 3² + - 8 square. So that is equal to square root of 169 + 9 + 64. And if you further simplify it then that will come out as 15.556. So in this way we got the magnitude of this vector 2 RP minus 3 Rn where both RP and the RN are the position vectors. So similarly now let us see the next example. So in this example we've been given that this vector A extends from the origin to the point 1 2 3 and similarly the another vector B extends from the origin to this point that is 2 3 - 2. So here first we have been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of a minus b and then after we have been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of the line that is extending from the origin to the midpoint of the line that is joining the points a and the b. So first of all let us see the first part and let us find the unit vector in the direction of a minus b. So here as per the given data we can say that this vector a is equal to ax + 2 a y + 3 a z and similarly this vector b is equal to 2 a x + 3 a y - 2 a z because both this vector a and b are starting from the origin and they are directed towards these two points. That means here these are the representation of the vector a and the b. So here to find the unit vector in the direction of the a minus b first we need to find this vector a minus b. So it can be found by doing the subtraction of these two vectors component wise. That means this a - b is equal to 1 - 2 * a x + 2 - 3 * a y + 3 - - 2 * a z. So that is equal to - a x - a y + 5 a z. So in this way we got this vector a minus b. So now in general we know that the unit vector in the direction of sub vector a can be given as the vector a itself divided by the magnitude of that vector. So similarly here the unit vector in the direction of this a minus b can be given as this vector a minus b divided by the magnitude of this vector a minus b. So for that first we need to find the magnitude of this vector a minus b. So it can be given as square root of a x² that is -1 square + a y square that is -1 square + az square that is equal to 5 square. And if you calculate the value then it will come out as 27. That means here the unit vector in the direction of the a minus b is equal to 1x 27 * this - a x - a y + 5 a z and in this way we got our unit vector in the direction of the a minus b. So similarly now let us see the second part of the question. So in the second part we've been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of the line that is extending from the origin towards the midpoint of the line that is joining the point A and the B. So first of all let us understand what it means and what we have been asked to find in the question. So here there are two points A and B in the cartisian form. Let's say this is point A and this is point B. So first of all let us draw a line that is joining the point A and the B. And now let's say the midpoint of this line is equal to M. So here we've been asked to find the unit vector that is starting from the origin and joining this point M. So basically here we've been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of this vector M. And for that first of all we need to find this vector RM. And of course to find that first let us find this point M. So here since M is the midpoint so we can say that this M is equal to A + the half of the distance between the point A and the B. Let's say the distance between the two points is equal to small D. That means here this M is equal to A + D / 2. And we know that this distance d can be given as a + this b minus a / 2. So in this way we can find this distance d. So based on this if you see the x component of this point m then that is equal to this a x + this bx minus a x / 2. So that is equal to 1 + this 2 - 1 / 2 and that is equal to 1.5. That means here this mx is equal to 1.5. Similarly this myy is equal to this a y + b yus a y / 2. So here this a y is equal to 2 and this b y - a y is equal to 3 - 2 / 2. That means here this my is equal to 2.5. So in this way we also got the second coordinate of this point m that is equal to 2.5 and likewise this mz is equal to this a z + bz minus a z divid by 2. So here the z component of this a vector is equal to 3. That means here this mz is equal to 3 + -2 - 3 / 2. That means here this -2 - 3 is equal to -5 and - 5 / 2 is equal to -2.5. That means this mz is equal to 3 - 2.5 that is equal to.5. So in this way we got all the three coordinates of this m point. And from this we can say that this vector m is equal to 1.5 ax plus 2.5 a y plus.5 az. And now we need to find the unit vector in this direction. So let us find that. So here the unit vector in the direction of the m can be given as this vector m divid by the magnitude of this vector m. So that is equal to 1.5 ax + 2.5 a y +.5 az divided by the square root of this mx² + m y square + mz². So in this case that is equal to 1.5 squared + 2.5 squared +.5². So if you just see the denominator then it will come out as 2.95. So we can say that the unit vector in the direction of the m is equal to 1 divid by 2.95 * this 1.5 ax plus 2.5 a y +.5 a z and if you want then you can also further simplify it will come out as 5 ax plus847 a y plus.169 a Z. So in this way we got the unit vector in the direction of the M. So so far we have seen the examples based on the position vector, distance vector and the unit vector. So now let us see the next example based on the vector field. So in this question we've been given the two vector fields G and the H. So here first we have been asked to find the magnitude of this vector field G and the H at this point P and then after we have been asked to find the unit vector at the point P. So first of all let us find the magnitude of this vector field G and the H. So to find that first of all let us find the respective vectors for this vector field G and the H at this point P. So let's say for this vector field G the vector at the point P is equal to GP and it can be found by putting the value of X Y and Z as 1 - 2 and the 3 respectively. That means here this vector GP is equal to 1 square A X minus - 2 * A Y + 2 * 3 * A Z. So that is equal to ax + 2 a y + 6 a z. So for this vector if you see its magnitude then that is equal to square root of 1 square + 2² + 6² and that is equal to square root of 41 that is roughly equal to 6.4. So similarly for this vector field H let let us find the vector at the point P and let's call it as HP and to find that once again in this expression let us put the value of X Y and Z as 1 - 2 and the 3 that means here this vector HP is equal to - 2 * 3 * A X + 3 A Y - 1 * 3 * a Z. That means this HP is equal to - 6 A X + 3 A Y - 3 A Z. And now if you see its magnitude then that is equal to square root of - 6² + 3² + - 3 square. So that is equal to square roo of 36 + 9 + 9 and that is equal to square root of 54. So if you further simplify it then that is roughly equal to 7.348. So in this way we found the magnitude of this vector field G and the H at this point P. So similarly for this vector field G let us find the unit vector at the point P. So we already know that this vector GP is equal to ax + 2 a y + 6 a z and we also know the magnitude of this gp that is equal to square root of 41. That means now the unit vector in the direction of the vector gp is equal to the vector gp divided by the magnitude of this vector gp. So that is equal to ax + 2 a y + 6 a z / root of 41. And if you further simplify it then it will come out as.156 * a x plus 312 * a y plus 937 * a z. So in this way for this vector field g we also found the unit vector at this point p. So I hope through these examples you understood if you have been given some points in the cartisian coordinate then from that how we can find the position vector distance vector as well as the unit vectors and moreover you also understood that if we have been given some vector field then how we can find the unit vector at the specific location. So now in the next video we will learn about the dot product and the cross productduct. So if you have any question or suggestion then do let me know here in the comment section below.

that will be a position vector rm. similarly if you draw a vector from the origin towards the point n then that will be a position vector rn. so here if you see this vector rmn then that is basically a position vector that is the vector that is drawn from the point m towards the point n and mathematically it can be represented as this vector rmn that is equal to this rn minus rm and in the previous video we already understood that how to represent this displacement vector right so here this vector rn can be represented as this 3 ax minus 3 a y 0 az and similarly this vector rm can be given as - ax 2 a y a z. so now this vector rmn is equal to this rn minus rm. so here we will do this subtraction component wise. so we can say that this rn - rm is equal to 3 - -1 a x - - 3 - 2 a y 0 - 1 a z. that means here this vector rmn is equal to this 4 ax minus 5 a y minus a z. so in this way we got this vector rmn. so similarly let us find this vector rmp. so for that we also need the position vector rp. so here this position vector rp can be given as - 2 ax - 3 a y - 4 az and here this vector rmp can be given as this vector rp minus rm and once again that can be found by doing the subtraction of this vector rp and the rm component wise. so we can say that that is equal to - 2 - -1 a x -3 - 2 a y -4 -1 a z. so that is equal to - a x - 5 a y - 5 az. so in this way we got this vector rmp and here as you can see we have been asked to find the addition of this vector rmp and the rmn. that means here this rmp plus rmn is equal to the addition of these two vectors. so once again we can find that by doing the component wise addition. that means here for these two vectors we will add their x, y and the z components respectively. that means here this rmp rmn is equal to this 4 -1 a x - 5 - 5 a y - -1 - 5 a z. so that is equal to 3 a x - 10 a y - 6 a z. so in this way we got the addition of these two distance vector. so apart from that here we have been also asked to find the magnitude of this 2 rp minus 3 rn. so let us find that. so here we know that this rp is equal to - 2 a x - 3 a y - 4 a z and similarly we know that this rn can be given as this 3 x - 3 a y that means here this 2 rp minus 3 rn is equal to these two times - 2 a x - 3 a y - 4 a zus 3 these 3 ax - 3 a y. so here let us add the x y and the z components separately. that means here if you further simplify it then we will get - 4 - 9 a x - - 6 9 a y - - 8 a z. so that is equal to -3 a x 3 a y - 8 a z. so in this way we got this vector 2 rp minus 3 rn. so now we need to find the magnitude of this vector. so in general we know that the magnitude of any vector a can be given as the square root of the ax² plus a y² az² where the ax a y and the az are the x y and the z component of the given vector. so in this case the magnitude of this 2 rp minus 3 rn is equal to the square root of - 13² 3² - 8 square. so that is equal to square root of 169 9 64. and if you further simplify it then that will come out as 15.556. so in this way we got the magnitude of this vector 2 rp minus 3 rn where both rp and the rn are the position vectors. so similarly now let us see the next example. so in this example weve been given that this vector a extends from the origin to the point 1 2 3 and similarly the another vector b extends from the origin to this point that is 2 3 - 2. so here first we have been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of a minus b and then after we have been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of the line that is extending from the origin to the midpoint of the line that is joining the points a and the b. so first of all let us see the first part and let us find the unit vector in the direction of a minus b. so here as per the given data we can say that this vector a is equal to ax 2 a y 3 a z and similarly this vector b is equal to 2 a x 3 a y - 2 a z because both this vector a and b are starting from the origin and they are directed towards these two points. that means here these are the representation of the vector a and the b. so here to find the unit vector in the direction of the a minus b first we need to find this vector a minus b. so it can be found by doing the subtraction of these two vectors component wise. that means this a - b is equal to 1 - 2 a x 2 - 3 a y 3 - - 2 a z. so that is equal to - a x - a y 5 a z. so in this way we got this vector a minus b. so now in general we know that the unit vector in the direction of sub vector a can be given as the vector a itself divided by the magnitude of that vector. so similarly here the unit vector in the direction of this a minus b can be given as this vector a minus b divided by the magnitude of this vector a minus b. so for that first we need to find the magnitude of this vector a minus b. so it can be given as square root of a x² that is -1 square a y square that is -1 square az square that is equal to 5 square. and if you calculate the value then it will come out as 27. that means here the unit vector in the direction of the a minus b is equal to 1x 27 this - a x - a y 5 a z and in this way we got our unit vector in the direction of the a minus b. so similarly now let us see the second part of the question. so in the second part weve been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of the line that is extending from the origin towards the midpoint of the line that is joining the point a and the b. so first of all let us understand what it means and what we have been asked to find in the question. so here there are two points a and b in the cartisian form. lets say this is point a and this is point b. so first of all let us draw a line that is joining the point a and the b. and now lets say the midpoint of this line is equal to m. so here weve been asked to find the unit vector that is starting from the origin and joining this point m. so basically here weve been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of this vector m. and for that first of all we need to find this vector rm. and of course to find that first let us find this point m. so here since m is the midpoint so we can say that this m is equal to a the half of the distance between the point a and the b. lets say the distance between the two points is equal to small d. that means here this m is equal to a d 2. and we know that this distance d can be given as a this b minus a 2. so in this way we can find this distance d. so based on this if you see the x component of this point m then that is equal to this a x this bx minus a x 2. so that is equal to 1 this 2 - 1 2 and that is equal to 1.5. that means here this mx is equal to 1.5. similarly this myy is equal to this a y b yus a y 2. so here this a y is equal to 2 and this b y - a y is equal to 3 - 2 2. that means here this my is equal to 2.5. so in this way we also got the second coordinate of this point m that is equal to 2.5 and likewise this mz is equal to this a z bz minus a z divid by 2. so here the z component of this a vector is equal to 3. that means here this mz is equal to 3 -2 - 3 2. that means here this -2 - 3 is equal to -5 and - 5 2 is equal to -2.5. that means this mz is equal to 3 - 2.5 that is equal to.5. so in this way we got all the three coordinates of this m point. and from this we can say that this vector m is equal to 1.5 ax plus 2.5 a y plus.5 az. and now we need to find the unit vector in this direction. so let us find that. so here the unit vector in the direction of the m can be given as this vector m divid by the magnitude of this vector m. so that is equal to 1.5 ax 2.5 a y .5 az divided by the square root of this mx² m y square mz². so in this case that is equal to 1.5 squared 2.5 squared .5². so if you just see the denominator then it will come out as 2.95. so we can say that the unit vector in the direction of the m is equal to 1 divid by 2.95 this 1.5 ax plus 2.5 a y .5 a z and if you want then you can also further simplify it will come out as 5 ax plus847 a y plus.169 a z. so in this way we got the unit vector in the direction of the m. so so far we have seen the examples based on the position vector, distance vector and the unit vector. so now let us see the next example based on the vector field. so in this question weve been given the two vector fields g and the h. so here first we have been asked to find the magnitude of this vector field g and the h at this point p and then after we have been asked to find the unit vector at the point p. so first of all let us find the magnitude of this vector field g and the h. so to find that first of all let us find the respective vectors for this vector field g and the h at this point p. so lets say for this vector field g the vector at the point p is equal to gp and it can be found by putting the value of x y and z as 1 - 2 and the 3 respectively. that means here this vector gp is equal to 1 square a x minus - 2 a y 2 3 a z. so that is equal to ax 2 a y 6 a z. so for this vector if you see its magnitude then that is equal to square root of 1 square 2² 6² and that is equal to square root of 41 that is roughly equal to 6.4. so similarly for this vector field h let let us find the vector at the point p and lets call it as hp and to find that once again in this expression let us put the value of x y and z as 1 - 2 and the 3 that means here this vector hp is equal to - 2 3 a x 3 a y - 1 3 a z. that means this hp is equal to - 6 a x 3 a y - 3 a z. and now if you see its magnitude then that is equal to square root of - 6² 3² - 3 square. so that is equal to square roo of 36 9 9 and that is equal to square root of 54. so if you further simplify it then that is roughly equal to 7.348. so in this way we found the magnitude of this vector field g and the h at this point p. so similarly for this vector field g let us find the unit vector at the point p. so we already know that this vector gp is equal to ax 2 a y 6 a z and we also know the magnitude of this gp that is equal to square root of 41. that means now the unit vector in the direction of the vector gp is equal to the vector gp divided by the magnitude of this vector gp. so that is equal to ax 2 a y 6 a z root of 41. and if you further simplify it then it will come out as.156 a x plus 312 a y plus 937 a z. so in this way for this vector field g we also found the unit vector at this point p. so i hope through these examples you understood if you have been given some points in the cartisian coordinate then from that how we can find the position vector distance vector as well as the unit vectors and moreover you also understood that if we have been given some vector field then how we can find the unit vector at the specific location. so now in the next video we will learn about the dot product and the cross productduct. so if you have any question or suggestion then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video hit the like

electronics. so in the previous video we understood that what is vectors and then after we understood that how the vector addition and the subtraction can be done and then after we also understood the concept of the vector fields. so in this video let us see some solve problems based on the concepts that we learned in the previous video. so here the first example is based on the vectors. so here in the first example we have been given the three points that is mn and the p in the cartisian coordinate. so here first we have been asked to find the addition of the vector rn plus rmpp. so in the cartisian coordinate system lets say there is some point m and there is a some point n. so from the origin if you draw a vector towards the point m then that will be a position vector rm. similarly if you draw a vector from the origin towards the point n then that will be a position vector rn. so here if you see this vector rmn then that is basically a position vector that is the vector that is drawn from the point m towards the point n and mathematically it can be represented as this vector rmn that is equal to this rn minus rm and in the previous video we already understood that how to represent this displacement vector right so here this vector rn can be represented as this 3 ax minus 3 a y 0 az and similarly this vector rm can be given as - ax 2 a y a z. so now this vector rmn is equal to this rn minus rm. so here we will do this subtraction component wise. so we can say that this rn - rm is equal to 3 - -1 a x - - 3 - 2 a y 0 - 1 a z. that means here this vector rmn is equal to this 4 ax minus 5 a y minus a z. so in this way we got this vector rmn. so similarly let us find this vector rmp. so for that we also need the position vector rp. so here this position vector rp can be given as - 2 ax - 3 a y - 4 az and here this vector rmp can be given as this vector rp minus rm and once again that can be found by doing the subtraction of this vector rp and the rm component wise. so we can say that that is equal to - 2 - -1 a x -3 - 2 a y -4 -1 a z. so that is equal to - a x - 5 a y - 5 az. so in this way we got this vector rmp and here as you can see we have been asked to find the addition of this vector rmp and the rmn. that means here this rmp plus rmn is equal to the addition of these two vectors. so once again we can find that by doing the component wise addition. that means here for these two vectors we will add their x, y and the z components respectively. that means here this rmp rmn is equal to this 4 -1 a x - 5 - 5 a y - -1 - 5 a z. so that is equal to 3 a x - 10 a y - 6 a z. so in this way we got the addition of these two distance vector. so apart from that here we have been also asked to find the magnitude of this 2 rp minus 3 rn. so let us find that. so here we know that this rp is equal to - 2 a x - 3 a y - 4 a z and similarly we know that this rn can be given as this 3 x - 3 a y that means here this 2 rp minus 3 rn is equal to these two times - 2 a x - 3 a y - 4 a zus 3 these 3 ax - 3 a y. so here let us add the x y and the z components separately. that means here if you further simplify it then we will get - 4 - 9 a x - - 6 9 a y - - 8 a z. so that is equal to -3 a x 3 a y - 8 a z. so in this way we got this vector 2 rp minus 3 rn. so now we need to find the magnitude of this vector. so in general we know that the magnitude of any vector a can be given as the square root of the ax² plus a y² az² where the ax a y and the az are the x y and the z component of the given vector. so in this case the magnitude of this 2 rp minus 3 rn is equal to the square root of - 13² 3² - 8 square. so that is equal to square root of 169 9 64. and if you further simplify it then that will come out as 15.556. so in this way we got the magnitude of this vector 2 rp minus 3 rn where both rp and the rn are the position vectors. so similarly now let us see the next example. so in this example weve been given that this vector a extends from the origin to the point 1 2 3 and similarly the another vector b extends from the origin to this point that is 2 3 - 2. so here first we have been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of a minus b and then after we have been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of the line that is extending from the origin to the midpoint of the line that is joining the points a and the b. so first of all let us see the first part and let us find the unit vector in the direction of a minus b. so here as per the given data we can say that this vector a is equal to ax 2 a y 3 a z and similarly this vector b is equal to 2 a x 3 a y - 2 a z because both this vector a and b are starting from the origin and they are directed towards these two points. that means here these are the representation of the vector a and the b. so here to find the unit vector in the direction of the a minus b first we need to find this vector a minus b. so it can be found by doing the subtraction of these two vectors component wise. that means this a - b is equal to 1 - 2 a x 2 - 3 a y 3 - - 2 a z. so that is equal to - a x - a y 5 a z. so in this way we got this vector a minus b. so now in general we know that the unit vector in the direction of sub vector a can be given as the vector a itself divided by the magnitude of that vector. so similarly here the unit vector in the direction of this a minus b can be given as this vector a minus b divided by the magnitude of this vector a minus b. so for that first we need to find the magnitude of this vector a minus b. so it can be given as square root of a x² that is -1 square a y square that is -1 square az square that is equal to 5 square. and if you calculate the value then it will come out as 27. that means here the unit vector in the direction of the a minus b is equal to 1x 27 this - a x - a y 5 a z and in this way we got our unit vector in the direction of the a minus b. so similarly now let us see the second part of the question. so in the second part weve been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of the line that is extending from the origin towards the midpoint of the line that is joining the point a and the b. so first of all let us understand what it means and what we have been asked to find in the question. so here there are two points a and b in the cartisian form. lets say this is point a and this is point b. so first of all let us draw a line that is joining the point a and the b. and now lets say the midpoint of this line is equal to m. so here weve been asked to find the unit vector that is starting from the origin and joining this point m. so basically here weve been asked to find the unit vector in the direction of this vector m. and for that first of all we need to find this vector rm. and of course to find that first let us find this point m. so here since m is the midpoint so we can say that this m is equal to a the half of the distance between the point a and the b. lets say the distance between the two points is equal to small d. that means here this m is equal to a d 2. and we know that this distance d can be given as a this b minus a 2. so in this way we can find this distance d. so based on this if you see the x component of this point m then that is equal to this a x this bx minus a x 2. so that is equal to 1 this 2 - 1 2 and that is equal to 1.5. that means here this mx is equal to 1.5. similarly this myy is equal to this a y b yus a y 2. so here this a y is equal to 2 and this b y - a y is equal to 3 - 2 2. that means here this my is equal to 2.5. so in this way we also got the second coordinate of this point m that is equal to 2.5 and likewise this mz is equal to this a z bz minus a z divid by 2. so here the z component of this a vector is equal to 3. that means here this mz is equal to 3 -2 - 3 2. that means here this -2 - 3 is equal to -5 and - 5 2 is equal to -2.5. that means this mz is equal to 3 - 2.5 that is equal to.5. so in this way we got all the three coordinates of this m point. and from this we can say that this vector m is equal to 1.5 ax plus 2.5 a y plus.5 az. and now we need to find the unit vector in this direction. so let us find that. so here the unit vector in the direction of the m can be given as this vector m divid by the magnitude of this vector m. so that is equal to 1.5 ax 2.5 a y .5 az divided by the square root of this mx² m y square mz². so in this case that is equal to 1.5 squared 2.5 squared .5². so if you just see the denominator then it will come out as 2.95. so we can say that the unit vector in the direction of the m is equal to 1 divid by 2.95 this 1.5 ax plus 2.5 a y .5 a z and if you want then you can also further simplify it will come out as 5 ax plus847 a y plus.169 a z. so in this way we got the unit vector in the direction of the m. so so far we have seen the examples based on the position vector, distance vector and the unit vector. so now let us see the next example based on the vector field. so in this question weve been given the two vector fields g and the h. so here first we have been asked to find the magnitude of this vector field g and the h at this point p and then after we have been asked to find the unit vector at the point p. so first of all let us find the magnitude of this vector field g and the h. so to find that first of all let us find the respective vectors for this vector field g and the h at this point p. so lets say for this vector field g the vector at the point p is equal to gp and it can be found by putting the value of x y and z as 1 - 2 and the 3 respectively. that means here this vector gp is equal to 1 square a x minus - 2 a y 2 3 a z. so that is equal to ax 2 a y 6 a z. so for this vector if you see its magnitude then that is equal to square root of 1 square 2² 6² and that is equal to square root of 41 that is roughly equal to 6.4. so similarly for this vector field h let let us find the vector at the point p and lets call it as hp and to find that once again in this expression let us put the value of x y and z as 1 - 2 and the 3 that means here this vector hp is equal to - 2 3 a x 3 a y - 1 3 a z. that means this hp is equal to - 6 a x 3 a y - 3 a z. and now if you see its magnitude then that is equal to square root of - 6² 3² - 3 square. so that is equal to square roo of 36 9 9 and that is equal to square root of 54. so if you further simplify it then that is roughly equal to 7.348. so in this way we found the magnitude of this vector field g and the h at this point p. so similarly for this vector field g let us find the unit vector at the point p. so we already know that this vector gp is equal to ax 2 a y 6 a z and we also know the magnitude of this gp that is equal to square root of 41. that means now the unit vector in the direction of the vector gp is equal to the vector gp divided by the magnitude of this vector gp. so that is equal to ax 2 a y 6 a z root of 41. and if you further simplify it then it will come out as.156 a x plus 312 a y plus 937 a z. so in this way for this vector field g we also found the unit vector at this point p. so i hope through these examples you understood if you have been given some points in the cartisian coordinate then from that how we can find the position vector distance vector as well as the unit vectors and moreover you also

jGoVQ6tDE3M,Vector Algebra | Vector Addition and Subtraction | Concept of Vector Fields,2025-11-01 05:30:07+00:00,2025,11,Saturday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the vector algebra. So first, we will understand that what is scalar and the vector. And then, we will learn about the vector addition and the subtraction. And then after, we will also learn about the scalar field and the vector fields. So in the introductory video of the electromagnetics, we have seen that this electromagnetic theory can be better understood with the help of the Maxwell equations. And to understand these Maxwell equations, we should know  the vector algebra and the vector analysis. And for that, first let us understand the concept of the scalar and the vector. So these scalar quantities can be expressed just using their magnitude. For example, this temperature, time, population, mass and the electric potential are the example of the scalar quantity. Because these quantities can be expressed just using the magnitude. For example, if we want to represent the temperature of some city, then we can say  that  the temperature of the city is equal to 35°C. Or if we want to represent the mass of some object, then we can say that  that is equal to 60 kg. And likewise, if we want to represent the electric potential or the voltage between the two nodes in the circuit, then we can say that that voltage is equal to 13 V. That means these scalar quantities can be represented just using their magnitude. On the other hand, if we see any vector, then it has both magnitude as well as the direction. So this velocity, force and the acceleration as well as the displacement  are the example of the vectors. Because these quantities have both magnitude as well as the direction. For example, if we want to represent the displacement, then it is important to mention the amount of the displacement as well as the direction in which this displacement is made. Similarly, from the electromagnetic perspective,  this electric field intensity is the example of the vector. So since the vectors have both magnitude as well as the direction, so typically, they are represented by the arrow on top of the symbol. So for example, the velocity is represented by the symbol V with the arrow on top of it. Likewise, the force F and the electric field intensity E can be represented like this. Now in the 3-dimensional space, if we have some vector A, then this is how it can be represented. And mathematically, this A can be represented as, this Ax times ax plus Ay times ay plus Az times az, where this Ax, Ay and Az are the components of this vector A in the direction of x, y and z. Then if we see this small ax, ay and az, then they are the unit vectors in the direction of x, y and z. That means if we see the vector ax, then it is a vector of magnitude 1 in the x direction. Similarly, this ay and az are also vectors of the magnitude 1 in the y and z direction. That means if we see the magnitude of all these vectors, then that is equal to 1. And that is why they are called the unit vectors. So when this unit vector ax is multiplied by the component Ax, then the magnitude of the unit vector will also get multiplied by the same amount. So it shows that this vector A has the component Ax in the x direction. Likewise, this Ay times ay represents that this vector A has the component Ay in the y direction. And likewise, we can say that the vector A has the component Az in the z direction. And when we add all these vector components together, then we will get this vector A. So basically, when we add all these vectors together, then it will lead us to the some point P in the 3D space. And from the origin, when we draw a vector towards this point P, then we will get this our vector A. So whenever we are representing this vector A mathematically or in the 3D space,  then its x, y, and z components are already representing its direction. But now let's see how to find its magnitude. So the magnitude of this vector A can be given as the square root of this (Ax)² plus (Ay)² plus (Az) ². And that is how we can find the magnitude of this vector A. So now, we know that this Ax, Ay and Az represent the unit vectors in the direction of  x, y and z respectively. So similarly, let's see how to find the unit vector in the direction of the A. And let's call it as aₐ. So this unit vector in the direction of A can be represented as this vector A divided by the magnitude of this vector A. So as you can see, if we try to find the magnitude of this unit vector, then it will come out as 1. Because that will be equal to |A| divided by |A|. And that is equal to 1. That means this expression represents the unit vector in the direction of the A. So for example, let's say we have some vector A that is equal to 3ax -5ay + 4az. So its magnitude can be given as the square root of this 3² + (-5)²  + 4² So that is basically equal to square root of (Ax)² plus (Ay)²  plus (Az)² . And in this case, that is equal to square root of 9 plus 25 plus 16. That is equal to square root of 50. So now, if we see the unit vector in the direction of the A, then that is equal to this vector A divided by the magnitude of the vector A. So that is equal to 3ax minus 5ay plus 4az, divided by the square root of 50. And if we further simplify it, then this unit vector aₐ is equal to 0.424 times ax minus 0.707 times ay plus 0.565 times az. So in this way, we can find the unit vector in the direction of the given vector. And of course, its magnitude will be equal to 1. So now, let's see the vector algebra and let's see the vector addition and the vector subtraction. So first, let's start with the vector addition. So this vector addition is similar to the normal algebraic addition in many aspects. So let's say, we have two vectors A and B in the Cartesian form. So now when we do the addition of these two vectors, then it will be done component wise. That means during the addition, the x, y and z components of each vector will be added. So in this case, if we do the addition, then this A +B will be equal to 7ax- 2ay + 6az And let's say, this A + B is equal to C. So similarly, this vector addition can also be done graphically. And to understand that, let's take two simple vectors, which have components only in the one direction. So let's say, this A is equal to 3ax and the B is equal to 4ay. So in the Cartesian coordinates, this vector A and B can be represented like this. That means here, this is the vector A, while this is the vector B. So now, while performing the addition of these two vectors, what we will do, we will place the tail of the second vector to the head of the first vector. And of course, we will keep its direction as it is. That means now during our addition, this is our vector A and this is our vector B. And now, the resultant vector is drawn from the tail of the first vector towards the  head of the first vector. And that is how we will get our A plus B. So this graphical method of the addition of the two vectors  is known as the head-to-tail method. So if you want to see the same thing in the 2D space,  then you can check the given link in the description. So here, you can give the x and y components of the two vectors. And once you provide that, then it will give you both addition and subtraction of these two vectors using the same method. So similar to the head-to-tail method, the same addition can also be done graphically using the parallelogram method. So to understand that, once again let's take the same vectors. So first, let's draw both vectors from the origin. That means here, this is the vector A, while this is the vector B. So here, now we will complete the parallelogram by drawing the remaining lines. So here, this line is parallel to the vector A and it is of the same length as the vector A Similarly, this line is parallel to the vector B, And also, it is of the same length as the vector B. So here, since both vectors A and B are originating from the same origin point,  so these vectors A and B are the two adjacent sides of the parallelogram. And now, the diagonal of this parallelogram that is drawn from the same origin represents the addition of these two vectors. That means here, this vector represents the A plus B. So this is another graphical method for the vector addition. So now, similar to the vector addition, let's see the vector subtraction. So let's say, this is the vector A, while this is the vector B. So mathematically, here this vector subtraction is similar to the vector addition. That means here, the subtraction of the two vectors is performed component-wise. That means here, during this A minus B, the x, y and z components of both vectors  are subtracted from each other. So for the given two vectors, if this A minus B is carried out, then it will come out as - 2ax + 2ay + 3az. And let's call this resultant vector as the vector C. So as you can see, this vector subtraction is very similar to the vector addition. So similar to the vector addition, this subtraction can also be carried out graphically. So once again, to understand that, let's take the vectors A and B, which has only one component. Let's say, this A is equal to 3ax, while the B is equal to 4ay. So first of all, let's represent these vectors graphically. So here, this vector will be the vector A, while this vector will be the vector B. Because as you can see, this vector A has the component only in the x direction,  while the vector B has the component only in the y direction. Now here, since we are performing the A minus B, so we also need the  (-B) vector. Because this A minus B is similar to A plus (-B). So here, we can get this (-B) vector by reversing the direction of this B vector. So now, this will be the (-B) vector. And now, to get this A plus (-B), we will follow the same procedure that we have followed earlier. That means here, we will align the tail of this (-B) vector to the head of the A vector. And now, the resultant vector is drawn from the tail of the vector A towards the head of the vector -B. And this vector represents A minus B. So the method which we have used over here is same as the head-to-tail method. And here, the same resultant vector A minus B can also be found  using the parallelogram method. So let me also show you that. So once again, we will take the same example. So first, let us represent this vector A and B in the 3D space. So once again, here both vectors A and B are starting from the same origin. But here, since we are performing the subtraction, so instead of the vector B,  we will require the vector -B. So for that, just let us reverse the direction of this vector B. So here, this -B vector has the same magnitude as the vector B,  but its direction is opposite. So here, this vector A and the vector -B are the two sides of the parallelogram. So now, let us complete this parallelogram by drawing the remaining two sides. So this side is parallel to the vector A and it is of the same length. And likewise, this line is parallel to the vector -B. And now, the diagonal of this parallelogram that is drawn from the same origin  represents the addition of the vector A and the -B. Or in other words, it represents the A minus B. So that is how the addition of the subtraction of the two vectors can be done graphically. So if you want to practice more and see that graphically, then you can visit the given link in the description and check the addition and subtraction of the 2D vectors. And if you want to see the same thing for the 3D vectors or the vector which has the three components, then for that also, the link is provided in the description. So please check those links, so that you can have a better idea about the vectors. So these vectors also follow some basic laws of the algebra. So let's say, we have three vectors that is A, B and the C. So for these three vectors, these are the commutative Law,  Associative Law and the Distributive Law. So as you can see, the basic laws of the algebra are also followed by these vectors. But similar to the algebra, among these laws, the Communitive and  the Associative laws are applicable only to the vector addition. But as you know, the vector subtraction does not follow these two laws. So in this way, the addition and subtraction is performed on the vectors. So all the vectors that we have seen so far are the position vectors. Because all these vectors are originating from some reference point O, and they are directed towards some point P in the 3D space. So basically, they are representing the position of some point P in the 3D space. And that is why they are called the position vectors. So let's say, the reference point for the origin is equal to O, and let's say, some point P in the Cartesian coordinate is equal to (4, 5, 7). So this position vector that is directed from the origin O to the P, or this Rp  can be given as 4ax + 5ay + 7az. So that is how all the vectors that we have seen so far are represented. Now similar to the position vector, we also have this displacement vector,  which is sometimes also known as the distance vector. So this distance vector shows the displacement from one point to another point. So in the Cartesian coordinate system, let's say, the one point is equal to point P,  while the another point is equal to Q. So this displacement vector Rpq shows the displacement from the point P to the point Q. So now let's see how to represent it. So for some point P, its position vector will be Rp, right? And similarly for the point Q, its position vector will be equal to RQ. And we know that, as per the vector addition rules, this Rp + Rpq is equal to RQ. Now from this we can say that this Rpq is equal to RQ - RP. So let's say, the Rp is equal to 4ax + 5ay + 7az. And the RQ is equal to 7ax + 8ay + 10az. That means here, this point P is (4, 5, 7), while this point Q is (7, 8, 10). So here, for the given two points, this displacement vector Rpq is equal to RQ minus RP. And that is equal to (7-4), that is 3ax + 3ay + 3az. So that is how we can find this displacement vector and in this way, we can represent  any vector in the 3D space that is not originating from the origin. So so far, we understood what is scalar and the vector. So similarly, now let's understand the concept of the scalar field and the vector field. Because during our discussion of the electromagnetic theory, we will come across many vector fields. And to understand that, first let's start with the scalar field. So if we see the scalar field, then it is the collection of the scalars. So in the scalar field, each point in the space has some magnitude. And mathematically, it can be represented as the function of x, y and z. So as we move around the space, then the value of the function  or the magnitude of the function will change. And the value at the specific location will depend on the expression of the given function. So the simple example of the scalar field is the temperature in the room. So as we move from one point to another point in the room, then the value of the temperature will change. Of course, this change will be very subtle, but there will be a definite change in the temperature as we move from one point to another point. Similarly, the pressure in the atmosphere is also another example of the scalar field. And from the electromagnetic perspective, the electric potential or the charge density are also examples of the scalar field. So in electromagnetics, apart from the scalar field,  we will also come across the vector fields. So in the scalar field, we have seen that each point in the space has the magnitude. So similarly in the vector field, each point in the space has its own vector. That means each point in the space has magnitude as well as the direction. So in case of the vector, we have seen that it has a component ax, ay and az in the respective direction. And for the given vector, they are the constant. On the other hand, in the vector field, the components ax, ay and az are functions of the x, y and z. So as we move around the space, then the value of this component ax, ay and az will change. And accordingly, the vector at the specific location will also change. So let's take one simple example. And through that, let's understand the concept of the vector field. So let's say, we want to find the vectors at the following location. So first, let's find the vector at this position. And let's call it as Ha. So here, to find this vector Ha, we will put these values of the x, y and the z. So if we put these values, then this Ha will come out as this (2)x(1)x(3) times ax,  minus  (1+ 5) times ay, plus (5)²  times az. And that is equal to 6 ax - 6 ay + 25 az. So this will be the vector at the position 1,3 and the 5. Similarly, let's find another vector at this position. And let's call it as the vector Hb. So here, to find this vector, we will put the value of the x, y and z as 4,1 and 6 respectively. That means here, the first component will be equal to 2 times, this 4 times 1. And similarly, the second component will be equal to 4 plus 6. And likewise, the third component will be equal to (6)². That means this vector Hb is equal to 8ax - 10ay + 36az. So in this way, as we move around the space, then we will get the different vectors at the different locations. So in electromagnetics, the electric field intensity and magnetic field intensity are some of the examples of the vector field. So later on, we will see them in detail. But I hope in this video, you understood what is scalar and the vector,  and how we can perform the vector addition and the subtraction. So in the next video, we will learn about the vector multiplication, and we will see the two types of vector multiplication. That is the dot product and the cross product of the vectors. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",vector algebra vector addition and subtraction concept of vector fields,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the vector algebra. so first, we will understand that what is scalar and the vector. and then, we will learn about the vector addition and the subtraction. and then after, we will also learn about the scalar field and the vector fields. so in the introductory video of the electromagnetics, we have seen that this electromagnetic theory can be better understood with the help of the maxwell equations. and to understand these maxwell equations, we should know the vector algebra and the vector analysis. and for that, first let us understand the concept of the scalar and the vector. so these scalar quantities can be expressed just using their magnitude. for example, this temperature, time, population, mass and the electric potential are the example of the scalar quantity. because these quantities can be expressed just using the magnitude. for example, if we want to represent the temperature of some city, then we can say that the temperature of the city is equal to 35c. or if we want to represent the mass of some object, then we can say that that is equal to 60 kg. and likewise, if we want to represent the electric potential or the voltage between the two nodes in the circuit, then we can say that that voltage is equal to 13 v. that means these scalar quantities can be represented just using their magnitude. on the other hand, if we see any vector, then it has both magnitude as well as the direction. so this velocity, force and the acceleration as well as the displacement are the example of the vectors. because these quantities have both magnitude as well as the direction. for example, if we want to represent the displacement, then it is important to mention the amount of the displacement as well as the direction in which this displacement is made. similarly, from the electromagnetic perspective, this electric field intensity is the example of the vector. so since the vectors have both magnitude as well as the direction, so typically, they are represented by the arrow on top of the symbol. so for example, the velocity is represented by the symbol v with the arrow on top of it. likewise, the force f and the electric field intensity e can be represented like this. now in the 3-dimensional space, if we have some vector a, then this is how it can be represented. and mathematically, this a can be represented as, this ax times ax plus ay times ay plus az times az, where this ax, ay and az are the components of this vector a in the direction of x, y and z. then if we see this small ax, ay and az, then they are the unit vectors in the direction of x, y and z. that means if we see the vector ax, then it is a vector of magnitude 1 in the x direction. similarly, this ay and az are also vectors of the magnitude 1 in the y and z direction. that means if we see the magnitude of all these vectors, then that is equal to 1. and that is why they are called the unit vectors. so when this unit vector ax is multiplied by the component ax, then the magnitude of the unit vector will also get multiplied by the same amount. so it shows that this vector a has the component ax in the x direction. likewise, this ay times ay represents that this vector a has the component ay in the y direction. and likewise, we can say that the vector a has the component az in the z direction. and when we add all these vector components together, then we will get this vector a. so basically, when we add all these vectors together, then it will lead us to the some point p in the 3d space. and from the origin, when we draw a vector towards this point p, then we will get this our vector a. so whenever we are representing this vector a mathematically or in the 3d space, then its x, y, and z components are already representing its direction. but now lets see how to find its magnitude. so the magnitude of this vector a can be given as the square root of this ax² plus ay² plus az ². and that is how we can find the magnitude of this vector a. so now, we know that this ax, ay and az represent the unit vectors in the direction of x, y and z respectively. so similarly, lets see how to find the unit vector in the direction of the a. and lets call it as aₐ. so this unit vector in the direction of a can be represented as this vector a divided by the magnitude of this vector a. so as you can see, if we try to find the magnitude of this unit vector, then it will come out as 1. because that will be equal to a divided by a. and that is equal to 1. that means this expression represents the unit vector in the direction of the a. so for example, lets say we have some vector a that is equal to 3ax -5ay 4az. so its magnitude can be given as the square root of this 3² -5² 4² so that is basically equal to square root of ax² plus ay² plus az² . and in this case, that is equal to square root of 9 plus 25 plus 16. that is equal to square root of 50. so now, if we see the unit vector in the direction of the a, then that is equal to this vector a divided by the magnitude of the vector a. so that is equal to 3ax minus 5ay plus 4az, divided by the square root of 50. and if we further simplify it, then this unit vector aₐ is equal to 0.424 times ax minus 0.707 times ay plus 0.565 times az. so in this way, we can find the unit vector in the direction of the given vector. and of course, its magnitude will be equal to 1. so now, lets see the vector algebra and lets see the vector addition and the vector subtraction. so first, lets start with the vector addition. so this vector addition is similar to the normal algebraic addition in many aspects. so lets say, we have two vectors a and b in the cartesian form. so now when we do the addition of these two vectors, then it will be done component wise. that means during the addition, the x, y and z components of each vector will be added. so in this case, if we do the addition, then this a b will be equal to 7ax- 2ay 6az and lets say, this a b is equal to c. so similarly, this vector addition can also be done graphically. and to understand that, lets take two simple vectors, which have components only in the one direction. so lets say, this a is equal to 3ax and the b is equal to 4ay. so in the cartesian coordinates, this vector a and b can be represented like this. that means here, this is the vector a, while this is the vector b. so now, while performing the addition of these two vectors, what we will do, we will place the tail of the second vector to the head of the first vector. and of course, we will keep its direction as it is. that means now during our addition, this is our vector a and this is our vector b. and now, the resultant vector is drawn from the tail of the first vector towards the head of the first vector. and that is how we will get our a plus b. so this graphical method of the addition of the two vectors is known as the head-to-tail method. so if you want to see the same thing in the 2d space, then you can check the given link in the description. so here, you can give the x and y components of the two vectors. and once you provide that, then it will give you both addition and subtraction of these two vectors using the same method. so similar to the head-to-tail method, the same addition can also be done graphically using the parallelogram method. so to understand that, once again lets take the same vectors. so first, lets draw both vectors from the origin. that means here, this is the vector a, while this is the vector b. so here, now we will complete the parallelogram by drawing the remaining lines. so here, this line is parallel to the vector a and it is of the same length as the vector a similarly, this line is parallel to the vector b, and also, it is of the same length as the vector b. so here, since both vectors a and b are originating from the same origin point, so these vectors a and b are the two adjacent sides of the parallelogram. and now, the diagonal of this parallelogram that is drawn from the same origin represents the addition of these two vectors. that means here, this vector represents the a plus b. so this is another graphical method for the vector addition. so now, similar to the vector addition, lets see the vector subtraction. so lets say, this is the vector a, while this is the vector b. so mathematically, here this vector subtraction is similar to the vector addition. that means here, the subtraction of the two vectors is performed component-wise. that means here, during this a minus b, the x, y and z components of both vectors are subtracted from each other. so for the given two vectors, if this a minus b is carried out, then it will come out as - 2ax 2ay 3az. and lets call this resultant vector as the vector c. so as you can see, this vector subtraction is very similar to the vector addition. so similar to the vector addition, this subtraction can also be carried out graphically. so once again, to understand that, lets take the vectors a and b, which has only one component. lets say, this a is equal to 3ax, while the b is equal to 4ay. so first of all, lets represent these vectors graphically. so here, this vector will be the vector a, while this vector will be the vector b. because as you can see, this vector a has the component only in the x direction, while the vector b has the component only in the y direction. now here, since we are performing the a minus b, so we also need the -b vector. because this a minus b is similar to a plus -b. so here, we can get this -b vector by reversing the direction of this b vector. so now, this will be the -b vector. and now, to get this a plus -b, we will follow the same procedure that we have followed earlier. that means here, we will align the tail of this -b vector to the head of the a vector. and now, the resultant vector is drawn from the tail of the vector a towards the head of the vector -b. and this vector represents a minus b. so the method which we have used over here is same as the head-to-tail method. and here, the same resultant vector a minus b can also be found using the parallelogram method. so let me also show you that. so once again, we will take the same example. so first, let us represent this vector a and b in the 3d space. so once again, here both vectors a and b are starting from the same origin. but here, since we are performing the subtraction, so instead of the vector b, we will require the vector -b. so for that, just let us reverse the direction of this vector b. so here, this -b vector has the same magnitude as the vector b, but its direction is opposite. so here, this vector a and the vector -b are the two sides of the parallelogram. so now, let us complete this parallelogram by drawing the remaining two sides. so this side is parallel to the vector a and it is of the same length. and likewise, this line is parallel to the vector -b. and now, the diagonal of this parallelogram that is drawn from the same origin represents the addition of the vector a and the -b. or in other words, it represents the a minus b. so that is how the addition of the subtraction of the two vectors can be done graphically. so if you want to practice more and see that graphically, then you can visit the given link in the description and check the addition and subtraction of the 2d vectors. and if you want to see the same thing for the 3d vectors or the vector which has the three components, then for that also, the link is provided in the description. so please check those links, so that you can have a better idea about the vectors. so these vectors also follow some basic laws of the algebra. so lets say, we have three vectors that is a, b and the c. so for these three vectors, these are the commutative law, associative law and the distributive law. so as you can see, the basic laws of the algebra are also followed by these vectors. but similar to the algebra, among these laws, the communitive and the associative laws are applicable only to the vector addition. but as you know, the vector subtraction does not follow these two laws. so in this way, the addition and subtraction is performed on the vectors. so all the vectors that we have seen so far are the position vectors. because all these vectors are originating from some reference point o, and they are directed towards some point p in the 3d space. so basically, they are representing the position of some point p in the 3d space. and that is why they are called the position vectors. so lets say, the reference point for the origin is equal to o, and lets say, some point p in the cartesian coordinate is equal to 4, 5, 7. so this position vector that is directed from the origin o to the p, or this rp can be given as 4ax 5ay 7az. so that is how all the vectors that we have seen so far are represented. now similar to the position vector, we also have this displacement vector, which is sometimes also known as the distance vector. so this distance vector shows the displacement from one point to another point. so in the cartesian coordinate system, lets say, the one point is equal to point p, while the another point is equal to q. so this displacement vector rpq shows the displacement from the point p to the point q. so now lets see how to represent it. so for some point p, its position vector will be rp, right? and similarly for the point q, its position vector will be equal to rq. and we know that, as per the vector addition rules, this rp rpq is equal to rq. now from this we can say that this rpq is equal to rq - rp. so lets say, the rp is equal to 4ax 5ay 7az. and the rq is equal to 7ax 8ay 10az. that means here, this point p is 4, 5, 7, while this point q is 7, 8, 10. so here, for the given two points, this displacement vector rpq is equal to rq minus rp. and that is equal to 7-4, that is 3ax 3ay 3az. so that is how we can find this displacement vector and in this way, we can represent any vector in the 3d space that is not originating from the origin. so so far, we understood what is scalar and the vector. so similarly, now lets understand the concept of the scalar field and the vector field. because during our discussion of the electromagnetic theory, we will come across many vector fields. and to

lets call it as ha. so here, to find this vector ha, we will put these values of the x, y and the z. so if we put these values, then this ha will come out as this 2x1x3 times ax, minus 1 5 times ay, plus 5² times az. and that is equal to 6 ax - 6 ay 25 az. so this will be the vector at the position 1,3 and the 5. similarly, lets find another vector at this position. and lets call it as the vector hb. so here, to find this vector, we will put the value of the x, y and z as 4,1 and 6 respectively. that means here, the first component will be equal to 2 times, this 4 times 1. and similarly, the second component will be equal to 4 plus 6. and likewise, the third component will be equal to 6². that means this vector hb is equal to 8ax - 10ay 36az. so in this way, as we move around the space, then we will get the different vectors at the different locations. so in electromagnetics, the electric field intensity and magnetic field intensity are some of the examples of the vector field. so later on, we will see them in detail. but i hope in this video, you understood what is scalar and the vector, and how we can perform the vector addition and the subtraction. so in the next video, we

by a. and that is equal to 1. that means this expression represents the unit vector in the direction of the a. so for example, lets say we have some vector a that is equal to 3ax -5ay 4az. so its magnitude can be given as the square root of this 3² -5² 4² so that is basically equal to square root of ax² plus ay² plus az² . and in this case, that is equal to square root of 9 plus 25 plus 16. that is equal to square root of 50. so now, if we see the unit vector in the direction of the a, then that is equal to this vector a divided by the magnitude of the vector a. so that is equal to 3ax minus 5ay plus 4az, divided by the square root of 50. and if we further simplify it, then this unit vector aₐ is equal to 0.424 times ax minus 0.707 times ay plus 0.565 times az. so in this way, we

subtraction does not follow these two laws. so in this way, the addition and subtraction is performed on the vectors. so all the vectors that we have seen so far are the position vectors. because all these vectors are originating from some reference point o, and they are directed towards some point p in the 3d space. so basically, they are representing the position of some point p in the 3d space. and that is why they are called the position vectors. so lets say, the reference point for the origin is equal to o, and lets say, some point p in the cartesian coordinate is equal to 4, 5, 7. so this position vector that is directed from the origin o to the p, or this rp can be given as 4ax 5ay 7az. so that is how all the vectors that we have seen so far are represented. now similar to the position vector, we also have this displacement vector, which is sometimes also known as the distance vector. so this distance vector shows the displacement from one point to another point. so in the cartesian coordinate system, lets say, the one point is equal to point p, while the another point is equal to q. so this displacement vector rpq shows the displacement from the point p to the point q. so now lets see how to represent it. so for some point p, its position vector will be rp, right? and similarly for the point q, its position vector will be equal to rq. and we know that, as per the vector addition rules, this rp rpq is equal to rq. now from this we can say that this rpq is equal to rq - rp. so lets say, the rp is equal to 4ax 5ay 7az. and the rq is equal to 7ax 8ay 10az. that means here, this point p is 4, 5, 7, while this point q is 7, 8, 10. so here, for the given two points, this displacement vector rpq is equal to rq minus rp. and that is equal to 7-4, that is 3ax 3ay 3az. so that is how we can find this displacement vector and in this way, we can represent any vector in the 3d space that is not originating from the origin. so so far, we understood what is scalar and the vector. so similarly, now lets understand the concept of the scalar field and the vector field. because during our discussion of the electromagnetic theory, we will come across many vector fields. and to understand that, first lets start with the scalar field. so if we see the scalar field, then it is the collection of the scalars. so in the scalar field, each point in the space has some magnitude. and mathematically, it can be represented as the function of x, y and z. so as we move around the space, then the value of the function or the magnitude of the function will change. and the value at the specific location will depend on the expression of the given function. so the simple example of the scalar field is the temperature in the room. so as we move from one point to another point in the room, then the value of the temperature will change. of course, this change will be very subtle, but there will be a definite change in the temperature as we move from one point to another point. similarly, the pressure in the atmosphere is also another example of the scalar field. and from the electromagnetic perspective, the electric potential or the charge density are also examples of the scalar field. so in electromagnetics, apart from the scalar field, we will also come across the vector fields. so in the scalar field, we have seen that each point in the space has the magnitude. so similarly in the vector field, each point in the space has its own vector. that means each point in the space has magnitude as well as the direction. so in case of the vector, we have seen that it has a component ax, ay and az in the respective direction. and for the given vector, they are the constant. on the other hand, in the vector field, the components ax, ay and az are functions of the x, y and z. so as we move around the space, then the value of this component ax, ay and az will change. and accordingly, the vector at the specific location will also change. so lets take one simple example. and through that, lets understand the concept of the vector field. so lets say, we want to find the vectors at the following location. so first, lets find the vector at this position. and lets call it as ha. so here, to find this vector ha, we will put these values of the x, y and the z. so if we put these values, then this ha will come out as this 2x1x3 times ax, minus 1 5 times ay, plus 5² times az. and that is equal to 6 ax - 6 ay 25 az. so this will be the vector at the position 1,3 and the 5. similarly, lets find another vector at this position. and lets call it as the vector hb. so here, to find this vector, we will put the value of the x, y and z as 4,1 and 6 respectively. that means here, the first component will be equal to 2 times, this 4 times 1. and similarly, the second component will be equal to 4 plus 6. and likewise, the third component will be equal to 6². that means this vector hb is equal to 8ax - 10ay 36az. so in this way, as we move around the space, then we will get the different vectors at the different locations. so in electromagnetics, the electric field intensity and magnetic field intensity are some of the examples of the vector field. so later on, we will see them in detail. but i hope in this video, you understood what is scalar and the vector, and how we can perform the vector addition and the subtraction. so in the next video, we will learn about the vector multiplication, and we will see the two types of vector multiplication. that is the dot product and the cross product of the vectors. so if you have any

FsS-FUdS4J4,Introduction to Electromagnetic Theory,2025-10-12 14:46:29+00:00,2025,10,Sunday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, and in the upcoming series of videos, we will learn about the electromagnetic theory. So, many technologies which we are using in our day-to-day life, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the 5G networks, as well as the fiber-optic communication, works on the principle of the electromagnetics. So these technologies rely on the behavior of the electromagnetic waves to transmit the information quickly and efficiently over the short and long distances. Beyond that, if you see the satellite communication, deep-space communication, as well as the radar systems, then they also operate on the same fundamental electromagnetic principle. In fact, the electromagnetics is the backbone of all modern communication and the sensing system which we are using today. So not only in the communication, but even in the devices like the printers, electric motors, as well as the generators and the power systems, the underlying principle of the operation is the electromagnetics. And that is why it is important to understand and learn the theory of the electromagnetics, because it helps us in learning, analyzing and designing all these technologies. So if you see the term Electromagnetics, then it is made up of the two terms, that is electric and magnetic. So basically, this electromagnetics is a physical phenomenon which involves the electric charge, field and the magnetic field, as well as the interaction between all of them. So in this electromagnetic theory, we will learn that how the electric charge, such as the charge of the electron, generates the electric field. Then after, we will see that how the magnetic field arises due to the moving charge. So basically, the change in the electric field generates the magnetic field. And similarly, the change in the magnetic field also generates the electric field. And whenever this electric and magnetic field interact with each other, then that generates the electromagnetic field. And this electromagnetic field propagates through the space like a wave. So during the course, we will learn all of that. But all this phenomenon can be best described by these four Maxwell equations. But as you can see, to understand them properly, we should have the knowledge of these mathematical operators or the vector operators beforehand. For example, in the first two equations, this term or in general, this del.A represents the divergence. Likewise, in the next two equations, this term or this del cross A represents the curl. So if we know that, then we can understand these equations properly and we can understand the electromagnetic theory in a better way. So in this course, first we will start with the vector algebra and the vector analysis. So after that, we will see the electrostatic module. And we will see that how the electric field is generated due to the static charge. And after that, we will learn the Coulomb's law and the Gauss law. And we will also understand the concept of the potential. And after that, we will see the same electric field in the materials. So after this electrostatic module, we will see the magnetostatic module. And we will learn that how the DC current generates the magnetic field. And then we will see the Biot-Savart's law and the Ampere's law. So after that, we will see the Maxwell equations, both in the integral and the differential form. And after that, we will learn the Faraday's law and the Ampere's Maxwell law. And also, we will understand the concept of the displacement current. And through all these, we will learn that how the electric and the magnetic fields are connected with each other and how they enable the wave propagation. So once we understand the Maxwell equation, then we will see the properties of the electromagnetic wave. So in that, we will understand the concept of the polarization and the reflection. And we will see that how the electromagnetic wave propagates through the different media. And then we will understand the pointing theorem and the pointing vector. So basically, in this module, we will understand the different properties of the electromagnetic wave and we will understand its behavior in the different media. And after that, we will see that how these electromagnetic waves can be guided using the transmission line and the waveguides. So through that, we will get to know that how the actual electromagnetic signal is guided using the coaxial cable and the fiber-optic cables in the real world. And then we will see the basics of the antenna and we will understand that how the electromagnetic wave is radiated using the antennas. And that will be useful in understanding how the wireless systems, radar and satellite communication happens in the real world. And during our discussion, to understand all these concepts more clearly, we will also take some solved examples. And during all this discussion, we will follow the following books. So you can find the link of these books in the description. So that is the overview of what we are going to learn in this course. So I hope in this video, you understood why the study of these electromagnetic theories is important. So from the next video, we will start with the vector algebra.

the upcoming series of videos, we will learn about the electromagnetic theory. so, many technologies which we are using in our day-to-day life, such as wi-fi, bluetooth and the 5g networks, as well as the fiber-optic communication, works on the principle of the electromagnetics. so these technologies rely on the behavior of the electromagnetic waves to transmit the information quickly and efficiently over the short and long distances. beyond that, if you see the satellite communication, deep-space communication, as well as the radar systems, then they also operate on the same fundamental electromagnetic principle. in fact, the electromagnetics is the backbone of all modern communication and the sensing system which we are using today. so not only in the communication, but even in the devices like the printers, electric motors, as well as the generators and the power systems, the underlying principle of the operation is the electromagnetics. and that is why it is important to understand and learn the theory of the electromagnetics, because it helps us in learning, analyzing and designing all these technologies. so if you see the term electromagnetics, then it is made up of the two terms, that is electric and magnetic. so basically, this electromagnetics is a physical phenomenon which involves the electric charge, field and the magnetic field, as well as the interaction between all of them. so in this electromagnetic theory, we will learn that how the electric charge, such as the charge of the electron, generates the electric field. then after, we will see that how the magnetic field arises due to the moving charge. so basically, the change in the electric field generates the magnetic field. and similarly, the change in the magnetic field also generates the electric field. and whenever this electric and magnetic field interact with each other, then that generates the electromagnetic field. and this electromagnetic field propagates through the space like a wave. so during the course, we will learn all of that. but all this phenomenon can be best described by these four maxwell equations. but as you can see, to understand them properly, we should have the knowledge of these mathematical operators or the vector operators beforehand. for example, in the first two equations, this term or in general, this del.a represents the divergence. likewise, in the next two equations, this term or this del cross a represents the curl. so if we know that, then we can understand these equations properly and we can understand the electromagnetic theory in a better way. so in this course, first we will start with the vector algebra and the vector analysis. so after that, we will see the electrostatic module. and we will see that how the electric field is generated due to the static charge. and after that, we will learn the coulombs law and the gauss law. and we will also understand the concept of the potential. and after that, we will see the same electric field in the materials. so after this electrostatic module, we will see the magnetostatic module. and we will learn that how the dc current generates the magnetic field. and then we will see the biot-savarts law and the amperes law. so after that, we will see the maxwell equations, both in the integral and the differential form. and after that, we will learn the faradays law and the amperes maxwell law. and also, we will understand the concept of the displacement current. and through all these, we will learn that how the electric and the magnetic fields are connected with each other and how they enable the wave propagation. so once we understand the maxwell equation, then we will see the properties of the electromagnetic wave. so in that, we will understand the concept of the polarization and the reflection. and we will see that how the electromagnetic wave propagates through the different media. and then we will understand the pointing theorem and the pointing vector. so basically, in this module, we will understand the different properties of the electromagnetic wave and we will understand its behavior in the different media. and after that, we will see that how these electromagnetic waves can be guided using the transmission line and the waveguides. so through that, we will get to know that how the actual electromagnetic signal is guided using the coaxial cable and the fiber-optic cables in the real world. and then we will see the basics of the antenna and we will understand that how the electromagnetic wave is radiated using the antennas. and that will be useful in understanding how the wireless systems, radar and satellite communication happens in the real world. and during our discussion, to understand all these concepts more clearly, we will also take some solved examples. and during all this discussion, we will follow the following books. so you can find the link of these books in the description. so that is the overview of what we are going to learn in this course. so i hope in this video, you understood why the study of these electromagnetic theories is important. so from the next video, we will start with the vector algebra. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more

Types of Vias in PCB. #pcb #allaboutelectronics,2025-10-04 18:06:26+00:00,2025,10,Saturday,"In this short video, let us understand what is the PCB wires and let us see the different types of wires in the PCB. So you must have seen the tiny copper holes in the PCB. So these holes are known as the vas. So these vas carries the electrical signal between the different layers of the PCB. So if you see these vas then it is the copper plated hole which creates the electrical connection between the different layers of the PCB. So in a way these wires enables the multi-layer PCB design and it contributes in the space saving in the PCB. So now let us see the different types of wires in the PCB. So the most common one is the through hole wire. So this through hole wire goes all the way from the top to bottom layer of the PCB and it connects all the layers along the way in the PCB but they take up the more space on the all layers. So in a very complex and the dense routings where even a millimeter space matters in those cases to connect the different layers either blind or the buried wires are used. So this blind via connects an outer layer to one or more internal layers but it does not go through the entire board and these vas are perfect for space saving in the dense PCB boards. Then if you see the buried wires then it lives completely inside the PCB and it connects only internal layers of the board without even reaching the outer surface. So if you see these vas then they are invisible from the outer side. But these vas are very useful in the high density designs. Now if you see the process of creating these buried wires or the blind wires then it requires the additional fabrication steps and these steps are known as the sequential lamination. So in this sequential lamination each PCB layer is first laminated and then after it is drilled. So because of that this process is more complex and the costly and that is why for making this buried and the blind wire require many steps. So an alternative to this in the highspeed PCB design is the back drilled via. So in this back drilled via instead of using the complex blind or the bured wires first a standard through hole wire is drilled. So here let's say we want to connect only the first three layers. So in this case the remaining unused and the unwanted part of this through hole is known as the stubs. So this tub acts as an antenna and it can cause the signal reflections impedance mismatch as well as the noise at the high frequencies. So to avoid that this unused stub is removed with the help of the back drilling. So such vas is known as the backd. So these are the different types of VAS that is used in the modern multi-layer PCB",what is pcb vias ? types of vias in pcb. pcb allaboutelectronics,"in this short video, let us understand what is the

Gu9M1auKVsk,Different Operating Regions of BJT #allaboutelectronics #bjt,2025-10-02 16:06:43+00:00,2025,10,Thursday,"In this short video we will learn about the  different operating regions of the BJT. So BJTs   are typically operated in the three regions. That  is active, cut-off and the saturation. But apart from   that there is also another region which is known  as the reverse active region. But typically BJTs   are not operated in this region. So one by one  let us see each of them. So in the active region   the base emitter junction is forward biased while  the collector base junction of the BJT is reverse   biased. So here since the base emitter junction is  forward biased and the collector base junction is   reverse biased, so this region defines the active  region of operation. So in this active region the   BJT is used as a amplifier. So of course to use  the BJT in the active region, first BJT needs to   be biased properly. So that the base-emitter junction gets  forward biased and the collector base junction   gets reversed biased. And after the proper biasing  when the AC input signal is applied to this BJT   then it will amplify that input signal. Then  if you see the next region then that is the   cut-off region. So in this region of operation  both base-emitter junction and the collector-base  junctions are reverse biased. And here since  both junctions are reversed biased. So this   region defines the cut-off region of operation.  So in this region of operation the collector   current is almost zero. And here as there is a no  flow of current from the collector to emitter.   So in this region, the BJT act as a open switch.  Then after the third region in which the BJT is   typically operated is the saturation region. So  in this region both base-emitter junction and the   collector-base junctions are forward biased. And  here since both junctions are forward biased. So   this region of operation defines the saturation  region. So to operate the BJT in the saturation,   it is biased in a such a way that a large  base current gets applied to the transistor.   And this base current is enough to drive  the collector current to its maximum value.   And whenever this maximum collector current  flows through the transistor then the value   of the VCE is very low. So in this region,  the transistor act as a closed switch.   So by operating the transistor in this cut-off and  the saturation, it can be used as a switch and it   can be used with the digital circuits. So these  are the different region of operation of the BJT.",different operating regions of bjt allaboutelectronics bjt,"in this short video we will learn about the different operating regions of the

XeZtJwiF4Oc,PCB Explained | What is PCB ? Types of PCB | Fabrication process of PCB Explained,2025-09-22 10:41:15+00:00,2025,9,Monday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the PCB. So we will see that what is PCB, why they are used, and thereafter, we will also see the different types of PCBs. And after that, we will see that how these PCBs are manufactured. So these PCBs are essential part of all modern gadgets and equipment that we are using. And it is called the printed circuit board, because here, the conductive paths or the copper traces of the electrical circuit pattern are created by printing and etching process on the insulating base. So let me quickly explain how the circuit pattern is printed on the insulating board. So here, for making the PCB, typically, this FR4 board is used as the base material. And this board consists of several layers. So in the center, it consists of the woven fiberglass, which is bonded with the epoxy resin. And if you see, then this is how it will look like. So this substrate gives the core support and the mechanical strength to the board, and it also provides the insulation. Now on both sides of this substrate, the thin copper film is laminated. And after the lamination, this is how the board will look like. And on this board, the circuit pattern is created. So to make the circuit pattern, a thin sheet of photoresist is applied on this FR4 board. So this photoresist is basically a light-sensitive polymer. So typically in the manufacturing, a negative photoresist is used. That means whenever this photoresist is exposed to the UV light, then it will get hardened. And the part of the photoresist, which is not exposed to the UV light, will remain soluble. So here, to create the circuit pattern on this copper layer, first the photomask is applied on this photoresist. So in this photomask, the area where we want to create the copper tracks is kept transparent. And other areas are kept opaque. And now, this photomask is applied on this photoresist material. So now, the areas which get exposed to the UV light, in those areas, the photoresist material will get hardened. While the other areas of the photoresist material, where the UV light is not exposed, those areas will remain soluble. So using the developer solution, it is easy to remove this unexposed photoresist. And now, using the etching process, the unwanted copper in this copper foil is removed. And after that, this photoresist is also stripped off. And in this way, the copper tracks are created on this insulating base. So in the later part of the video, you will see all the steps of the PCB fabrication. But in this way, through the printing and the etching process, the circuit pattern is printed on the insulating base. And that is why it is called the printed circuit board. So now, let's see why these PCBs are used. So before the PCBs, the electronic circuit used point-to-point construction, where the components were connected directly by the individual wires. So of course, as you guess, this method was time-consuming, prone to errors, and it was difficult to repair and maintain the circuit. So this photograph shows the internals of the 1948 Motorola TV, where the components were interconnected directly with the individual wires. So as you can see, in such a case, the repair is also very difficult. On the other hand, when we use the PCB, then the design becomes quite compact and it is also space-efficient. Moreover, the use of the PCB provides enhanced reliability and durability. Because on the PCB, as the components are securely mounted via a soldering, so they remain there even under stress. Moreover, here as the PCB tracks are bonded on the board, so it always provides a stable and reliable connection. Not only that, the use of the PCB also reduces the fabrication time and cost, specifically in the case of mass production. Because due to the standard manufacturing process, once the design is finalized, then the mass production becomes cost-effective. Moreover, these PCBs also provide superior electrical performance and it also reduces the electrical noise significantly compared to the point-to-point connections of the components. And these are the reasons why the PCBs are the essential part of any electrical or electronic system. So now let's see the different types of PCBs. So these PCBs are categorized in several ways. The one of them is based on the number of layers. So if you see the simplest one, then that is the single-layer PCB, where we have a copper layer only on the one side. So we have seen that, typically, this FR4 board has a layer of the fiberglass and this layer acts as an insulating layer. And on both sides of this insulating material, the thin copper layer is laminated. But in the case of the single-sided PCB, the copper layer is only on the one side. So here, the components are mounted on the insulating side, while the electrical connections are routed through the copper traces on the other side of the PCB. So these single-sided PCBs are easy to design and manufacture. Now since these boards have only one conductive layer, so these conductive paths or the copper traces cannot cross or overlap. And due to that, such PCBs are ideal only for the low-density design requirement. So these single-sided PCBs are used for the low-cost and simple electronic devices, such as the calculators, the LED lighting board, the power supplies and some timing circuits. Similarly, we also have the two-sided PCBs, or it is also known as the two-layer PCB. So in this case, we have two copper layers, both on the top and bottom side of the substrate. So in this two-sided PCB, as both sides can be used for the signal routing, so it can accommodate more components. So similarly, the third type of PCB is the multi-layer PCB, where we have more than two conductive layers. So here, since the internal layers do not occupy any component space, so these internal layers are only used for the signal routing. And that is why these PCBs provide much more component density. So these type of PCBs are preferred where we require the miniaturization or in the applications where we require the good signal integrity and reliability, such as in the high-speed and the high-frequency applications. So this classification of the PCBs is based on the number of layers. Similarly, the PCBs are also classified based on their flexibility. So based on the flexibility, the one type of the PCB is the rigid PCB. So all the PCBs that we have discussed so far were the case of the rigid PCB. So as we have seen, these PCBs are built on the solid non-flexible substrate such as the FR4. So as it is the rigid PCB, so it retains its shape, and it also provides the good mechanical stability. Then based on the flexibility, if we see the next type, then that is the flex PCB, or it is also known as the flexible PCB. So these PCBs can bend and fold in the compact spaces. So as we have seen, the base material in the rigid PCBs is the fiber-reinforced epoxy resin, and because of which, it remains sturdy. Similarly in the flex PCBs, to get the required flexibility, the polyamide is used as the base material. So these PCBs are ultra-thin, lightweight, and they are adaptable to the complex geometries. And as they are flexible, so they provide the greater resistance to the vibration and the mechanical stress. So they are used in the applications where we require the flexibility, such as the display hinges in smartphones as well as in the fitness trackers. So so far, in terms of the flexibility, we have the two types of PCBs. That is the rigid PCB and the flex PCB. Apart from that, we also have the rigid flex PCBs. So these PCBs combine both the rigid and the flexible sections in the single board layout. So these type of PCBs are used in the foldable devices, in high-end cameras, as well as they are also used in the aerospace and the defense applications. Apart from that, they are also used in some implantable medical devices. So this is the classification of the PCBs based on their flexibility. So so far, we understood that what is PCB, why they are used, and what are the different types of PCBs. So now, let's understand how these PCBs are manufactured. So partly, we have seen that how the copper tracks of the electrical circuit are printed and etched on the insulating board. But now, let's understand the full process. And first, we will understand this process for the two-layer PCB. So for the two-layer PCB, first the FR4 board, which is laminated with the copper foils on both sides is taken. And then, the required drilling is carried out. So this drilling includes the drilling for the mounting holes, the through holes for the ICs and other components, as well as the through holes to connect the copper traces on both sides. Now as you can see, by default, these holes do not connect the two layers directly. So to make them conductive, and to establish the connection between the two layers, first the electroless copper plating is carried out. So this process is the chemical process, and it does not require any external power supply. So this process deposits a thin uniform copper layer on the non-conductive surface of the PCBs, including the through holes. And through this process, an electrical connection is established between the two layers. So this process makes the non-conductive surface conductive, and it creates the conductive seed layer for the next electroplating process, which further thickens the copper layers. But before this electroplating process, a thin layer of the photoresist is applied on this copper clad. And after that, a photomask is aligned on this photoresist material. So here we are assuming that the given photoresist is the negative photoresist. So here on this photomask, every one of the copper tracks will be kept opaque. And the rest of the area will be kept transparent. So now, after applying the photomask, when the photoresist is exposed to the UV light, then the photoresist area which is transparent to the UV light gets hardened. And the areas which are not exposed to the UV light will remain soluble. So on those parts, once the photoresist is removed, then the copper tracks will be visible. Now to make these required tracks thicker, the electroplating process is carried out. So in this process, these PCBs are immersed in the electroplating bath, where the PCB acts as a cathode and the copper rod acts as anode. And now, the current is passed through this solution. So by controlling the current and the duration of the current, a uniform copper layer is deposited on the inner walls of the through hole as well as on the areas where we need the copper tracks. So now, to protect these copper tracks, a thin layer of the tin is coated using the electroplating process. So this process is similar to the electroplating process of the copper, but in this case, instead of the copper ions, now the tin ions will get deposited on the exposed area. And the area which is protected by the photoresist will remain as it is. So once the copper tracks are protected by this thin layer, then to remove this unwanted copper, first the photoresist material is stripped off. And it is stripped off using the chemical process. So then after, the PCB is submerged in the alkaline etching solution, which removes all the unwanted copper that is not protected by the tin plating. And now, the insulating layer of the substrate is visible from where the copper is removed. So this process of removing the unwanted copper is known as the etching process. And after the etching process, the protective tin layer on the copper tracks is also stripped off. So now, these copper tracks are also visible. So now, to protect these copper traces from the oxidation and environmental damage, a thin polymer coating is applied on the surface of the PCB. So this coating is known as the solder mask. So this solder mask can be of any color, but predominantly, the green color solder mask is used. Because this green color is optimal for the manual as well as the automated visual inspection of the PCBs. So because of this solder mask, the PCBs which we are using and seeing are getting their green color. So after the application of this solder mask, a photo mask is applied and aligned to the PCB to cover all the solder pads, which will be later used for the soldering. And once all the solder pads are covered, then the solder mask is exposed to the UV light. So the transparent areas which are exposed to the UV light will get hardened. And the areas which are UV protected from those areas, the solder mask is then washed away. And now, the copper pads are visible once again. So now, on these exposed copper pads, a thin protective coating is applied to prevent the oxidation of the copper. So this process is known as the surface finish. So the surface finish not only protects the copper pads from the oxidation, but it also provides the good solder ability. So the different types of surface finish methods are used for the PCBs. But the most common one is the HASL, that is the Hot Air Solder Leveling. So in this process, a thin layer of the tin is coated on the copper pads. And after the surface finish, a silkscreen layer is applied. So in this silkscreening process, using the white epoxy ink, the component outlines, text and the logos are printed on the PCB. So through the silkscreening layer, anyone who is assembling the PCB can know that in which orientation the component should be mounted. So here on the PCB, the component outlines that is shown in the white colour represents the silkscreen layer. And after that, if the PCB is manufactured in the automated assembly, then the flying probe test is carried out to check the continuity of the electrical connections and to find out any open or shorts in the circuit. And after that, the final inspection is carried out. So this inspection can be either a manual visual inspection or it can be an automated optical inspection. And that is how the two-layer PCB is manufactured. Now if you see the multi-layer PCB fabrication technique, then most of the steps remains the same. But this multi-layer PCB also involves few more fabrication steps for making the inner layers. But the fabrication steps for the outer layer are almost identical to the two-layer PCB fabrication. So here, let us understand the fabrication process of the multi-layer PCB and let us take the example of the four-layer PCB. So as we have seen, the four-layer PCB consists of the four conductive layers of the copper that are separated by the insulating layer. So in the four-layer PCB, or in general in the multi-layer PCB, the first thing that we have is the core, that is the central part of the PCB and it provides the mechanical strength and the support to the PCB. And around this core, the different copper layers are added. So here, this prepreg acts as an insulating layer and it isolates the different additional layers that are added around the core. So first, let us see the core. So this core structure is very similar to the FR4 structure, where in the center, we have a fiber-reinforced epoxy resin layer and around that we have the two copper layers. So in the multi-layer PCB design, first this core is prepared and once it is ready, then with the help of the prepreg, the other copper layers are bonded with the core. So here, this prepreg is a fiberglass cloth that is pre-impregnated with partially cured resin. So here, this prepreg acts as an adhesive layer and it also acts as an insulating layer between the core and the copper foils. So with the help of this prepreg, the other copper layers are bonded with the core and once all the layers are stacked up, then this assembled stack of the copper layers is placed in a vacuum heat press machine for a lamination under the high temperature and the pressure. So at this high temperature and the pressure, the resin inside the prepreg melts and it bonds all the layers together. And in this way, we have a single board, which consists of multiple layers of the copper. So this PCB manufacturing starts with the design of the Gerber file. So here, the Gerber files are standard digital files that defines every geometric detail of the PCB's layer, such as copper traces, solder mask openings, silkscreen graphics, drill locations, and the board outline. So for a specific circuit design, first these Gerber files are created. And based on this created Gerber file, the DFM check is run. So here, this DFM check evaluates this Gerber and the other production files to confirm that the board can indeed be reliably fabricated and assembled with the given tolerance. And once the DFM check is alright, then first the inner layer imaging is carried out. That is creating the circuit pattern on the core. So first on the inner layer, a thin sheet of the photoresist is applied. And typically as we have seen, a negative photoresist material is used. That means when a part of the photoresist that is exposed to the UV gets hardened, while the other part remains soluble. So after the UV exposure, the softer part is removed. Before that, first the photo mask is applied on the photoresist. Now in case of the inner layer imaging, if you see the photo mask, then that is exactly opposite to the outer layer imaging mask. So here, where we want the copper tracks, those parts are kept transparent. So after the UV exposure, those parts will get hardened. So nowadays, in many multilayer PCB fabrication facilities, instead of using the photo mask, a laser direct imaging technique is used. So here, this LDI is the advanced technique in the PCB manufacturing, where a computer controlled laser is used to create the circuit pattern on the photoresist material without using the traditional photo mask. So in this case, the PCB areas where we want the copper track is exposed using the laser. And those parts will get hardened after the UV exposure. So this softer photoresist is first removed, and then through the etching process, the unwanted copper is removed. And after the removal of the copper, the hardened photoresist material is stripped off using the alkaline chemical solution. So from the top side, before the etching and stripping steps, this is how the PCB will look like. And once the unwanted copper is removed, and the photoresist material is stripped off, then this is how the PCB will look like. So of course, here only the top side is shown, but the same process also happens for the bottom side. And in this way, the inner layer imaging is carried out in the multilayer PCB. So once the inner layers are ready, then the other layers are added using the lamination process. So here, first prepreg is applied both on the top and the bottom side of the core. That acts as an insulating layer, and it also acts as an adhesive. And after that, as you have seen earlier, this assembled stack is placed in a vacuum heat press machine for the lamination under the high temperature and the high pressure. So once the lamination process is complete, then the processing for the outer layer is carried out. And as you have seen, this process is very similar to the procedure that we have seen for the two-sided PCB. So we have already seen those steps, but here let me just cover them for the continuity of the process. So here, once all the layers are stacked up and laminated, then first the drilling is carried out. So this drilling is carried out for the mounting holes as well as for the components and for all the through holes, which goes through all the layers of the PCB. So here, just for the representation purpose, only the top layer is shown in the 3D view. So after the drilling, the next step is the desmearing, which is the cleaning process that removes the resin smear and the drilling debris from the walls of the drilled hole. And after that, this electroless copper deposition is carried out to make the non-conductive inner walls of the drilled holes conductive. So this process forms the conductive seed layer on the inner walls of the drilled holes. And after this process, a thin photoresist layer is applied. So here, in this outer layer imaging, all the tracks and the copper pads where we want to do the copper plating, those regions are kept opaque in the photo mask. And the rest of the area is exposed to the UV light. So the areas that are exposed to the UV light gets hardened and those areas where the UV light is not falling will remain soft. So from those areas, the photoresist can be removed easily. And in this way, all the copper tracks and the holes where we want to do the copper plating will be visible. So many times, instead of using the photo mask, this step is directly done using the laser direct imaging. And after that, in the exposed area, the copper plating is carried out. So after this electroplating, to protect the plated copper tracks and the copper pads, a protective tin coating is applied using the electroplating method. And this method is similar to the electroplating method of the copper. So once this protective tin layer is applied, then after that, this hardened photoresist layer is stripped off using the alkaline chemical. So now, this unwanted copper is removed using the etching process. And after that, a protective tin layer on the tracks and the holes is also removed. And now, our required copper tracks and the copper pads are visible. So after this step, the solder mask is applied and using the photo mask, the required holes for the soldering are covered. So now, whenever this solder mask is exposed to the UV light, then due to the exposure of the UV light, the solder mask will get hardened. And the part of the solder mask, which is unexposed to the UV light is removed. Or in a way, the solder mask from the copper pad is removed. So this step protects the copper tracks from the accidental solder bridges and the oxidation. And after this step, the surface finish is carried out on the copper pads for the better solderability of the components. And then comes the silkscreen step, where a white polymer ink is applied at the required locations on the PCB for the naming of the components as well as for the orientation and the polarity of the components. And after that, the final finishing and the visual inspection of the PCB is carried out. So these are the steps that are involved in the fabrication of the multi-layer PCB. So typically in the fabrication of the 4-layer PCB, to connect these 4 connecting layers, we have the through holes. And through these through holes, the different layers are electrically connected with each other. But many times, when we go for the 6-layer or even higher layer PCBs that are commonly used in the high-density circuits and in the high-speed applications in those PCBs, many times these different layers are connected through the different wires. So regarding that, we will cover it in the separate video. But I hope in this video, you understood what is PCB, why it is called the printed circuit board and you also understood why these PCBs are used. Then after, we also understood that what are the different types of PCBs and how the 2-layer and the 4-layer PCBs are fabricated. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",pcb explained what is pcb ? types of pcb fabrication process of pcb explained,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the pcb. so we will see that what is pcb, why they are used, and thereafter, we will also see the different types of pcbs. and after that, we will see that how these pcbs are manufactured. so these pcbs are essential part of all modern gadgets and equipment that we are using. and it is called the printed circuit board, because here, the conductive paths or the copper traces of the electrical circuit pattern are created by printing and etching process on the insulating base. so let me quickly explain how the circuit pattern is printed on the insulating board. so here, for making the pcb, typically, this fr4 board is used as the base material. and this board consists of several layers. so in the center, it consists of the woven fiberglass, which is bonded with the epoxy resin. and if you see, then this is how it will look like. so this substrate gives the core support and the mechanical strength to the board, and it also provides the insulation. now on both sides of this substrate, the thin copper film is laminated. and after the lamination, this is how the board will look like. and on this board, the circuit pattern is created. so to make the circuit pattern, a thin sheet of photoresist is applied on this fr4 board. so this photoresist is basically a light-sensitive polymer. so typically in the manufacturing, a negative photoresist is used. that means whenever this photoresist is exposed to the uv light, then it will get hardened. and the part of the photoresist, which is not exposed to the uv light, will remain soluble. so here, to create the circuit pattern on this copper layer, first the photomask is applied on this photoresist. so in this photomask, the area where we want to create the copper tracks is kept transparent. and other areas are kept opaque. and now, this photomask is applied on this photoresist material. so now, the areas which get exposed to the uv light, in those areas, the photoresist material will get hardened. while the other areas of the photoresist material, where the uv light is not exposed, those areas will remain soluble. so using the developer solution, it is easy to remove this unexposed photoresist. and now, using the etching process, the unwanted copper in this copper foil is removed. and after that, this photoresist is also stripped off. and in this way, the copper tracks are created on this insulating base. so in the later part of the video, you will see all the steps of the pcb fabrication. but in this way, through the printing and the etching process, the circuit pattern is printed on the insulating base. and that is why it is called the printed circuit board. so now, lets see why these pcbs are used. so before the pcbs, the electronic circuit used point-to-point construction, where the components were connected directly by the individual wires. so of course, as you guess, this method was time-consuming, prone to errors, and it was difficult to repair and maintain the circuit. so this photograph shows the internals of the 1948 motorola tv, where the components were interconnected directly with the individual wires. so as you can see, in such a case, the repair is also very difficult. on the other hand, when we use the pcb, then the design becomes quite compact and it is also space-efficient. moreover, the use of the pcb provides enhanced reliability and durability. because on the pcb, as the components are securely mounted via a soldering, so they remain there even under stress. moreover, here as the pcb tracks are bonded on the board, so it always provides a stable and reliable connection. not only that, the use of the pcb also reduces the fabrication time and cost, specifically in the case of mass production. because due to the standard manufacturing process, once the design is finalized, then the mass production becomes cost-effective. moreover, these pcbs also provide superior electrical performance and it also reduces the electrical noise significantly compared to the point-to-point connections of the components. and these are the reasons why the pcbs are the essential part of any electrical or electronic system. so now lets see the different types of pcbs. so these pcbs are categorized in several ways. the one of them is based on the number of layers. so if you see the simplest one, then that is the single-layer pcb, where we have a copper layer only on the one side. so we have seen that, typically, this fr4 board has a layer of the fiberglass and this layer acts as an insulating layer. and on both sides of this insulating material, the thin copper layer is laminated. but in the case of the single-sided pcb, the copper layer is only on the one side. so here, the components are mounted on the insulating side, while the electrical connections are routed through the copper traces on the other side of the pcb. so these single-sided pcbs are easy to design and manufacture. now since these boards have only one conductive layer, so these conductive paths or the copper traces cannot cross or overlap. and due to that, such pcbs are ideal only for the low-density design requirement. so these single-sided pcbs are used for the low-cost and simple electronic devices, such as the calculators, the led lighting board, the power supplies and some timing circuits. similarly, we also have the two-sided pcbs, or it is also known as the two-layer pcb. so in this case, we have two copper layers, both on the top and bottom side of the substrate. so in this two-sided pcb, as both sides can be used for the signal routing, so it can accommodate more components. so similarly, the third type of pcb is the multi-layer pcb, where we have more than two conductive layers. so here, since the internal layers do not occupy any component space, so these internal layers are only used for the signal routing. and that is why these pcbs provide much more component density. so these type of pcbs are preferred where we require the miniaturization or in the applications where we require the good signal integrity and reliability, such as in the high-speed and the high-frequency applications. so this classification of the pcbs is based on the number of layers. similarly, the pcbs are also classified based on their flexibility. so based on the flexibility, the one type of the pcb is the rigid pcb. so all the pcbs that we have discussed so far were the case of the rigid pcb. so as we have seen, these pcbs are built on the solid non-flexible substrate such as the fr4. so as it is the rigid pcb, so it retains its shape, and it also provides the good mechanical stability. then based on the flexibility, if we see the next type, then that is the flex pcb, or it is also known as the flexible pcb. so these pcbs can bend and fold in the compact spaces. so as we have seen, the base material in the rigid pcbs is the fiber-reinforced epoxy resin, and because of which, it remains sturdy. similarly in the flex pcbs, to get the required flexibility, the polyamide is used as the base material. so these pcbs are ultra-thin, lightweight, and they are adaptable to the complex geometries. and as they are flexible, so they provide the greater resistance to the vibration and the mechanical stress. so they are used in the applications where we require the flexibility, such as the display hinges in smartphones as well as in the fitness trackers. so so far, in terms of the flexibility, we have the two types of pcbs. that is the rigid pcb and the flex pcb. apart from that, we also have the rigid flex pcbs. so these pcbs combine both the rigid and the flexible sections in the single board layout. so these type of pcbs are used in the foldable devices, in high-end cameras, as well as they are also used in the aerospace and the defense applications. apart from that, they are also used in some implantable medical devices. so this is the classification of the pcbs based on their flexibility. so so far, we understood that what is pcb, why they are used, and what are the different types of pcbs. so now, lets understand how these pcbs are manufactured. so partly, we have seen that how the copper tracks of the electrical circuit are printed and etched on the insulating board. but now, lets understand the full process. and first, we will understand this process for the two-layer pcb. so for the two-layer pcb, first the fr4 board, which is laminated with the copper foils on both sides is taken. and then, the required drilling is carried out. so this drilling includes the drilling for the mounting holes, the through holes for the ics and other components, as well as the through holes to connect the copper traces on both sides. now as you can see, by default, these holes do not connect the two layers directly. so to make them conductive, and to establish the connection between the two layers, first the electroless copper plating is carried out. so this process is the chemical process, and it does not require any external power supply. so this process deposits a thin uniform copper layer on the non-conductive surface of the pcbs, including the through holes. and through this process, an electrical connection is established between the two layers. so this process makes the non-conductive surface conductive, and it creates the conductive seed layer for the next electroplating process, which further thickens the copper layers. but before this electroplating process, a thin layer of the photoresist is applied on this copper clad. and after that, a photomask is aligned on this photoresist material. so here we are assuming that the given photoresist is the negative photoresist. so here on this photomask, every one of the copper tracks will be kept opaque. and the rest of the area will be kept transparent. so now, after applying the photomask, when the photoresist is exposed to the uv light, then the photoresist area which is transparent to the uv light gets hardened. and the areas which are not exposed to the uv light will remain soluble. so on those parts, once the photoresist is removed, then the copper tracks will be visible. now to make these required tracks thicker, the electroplating process is carried out. so in this process, these pcbs are immersed in the electroplating bath, where the pcb acts as a cathode and the copper rod acts as anode. and now, the current is passed through this solution. so by controlling the current and the duration of the current, a uniform copper layer is deposited on the inner walls of the through hole as well as on the areas where we need the copper tracks. so now, to protect these copper tracks, a thin layer of the tin is coated using the electroplating process. so this process is similar to the electroplating process of the copper, but in this case, instead of the copper ions, now the tin ions will get deposited on the exposed area. and the area which is protected by the photoresist will remain as it is. so once the copper tracks are protected by this thin layer, then to remove this unwanted copper, first the photoresist material is stripped off. and it is stripped off using the chemical process. so then after, the pcb is submerged in the alkaline etching solution, which removes all the unwanted copper that is not protected by the tin plating. and now, the insulating layer of the substrate is visible from where the copper is removed. so this process of removing the unwanted copper is known as the etching process. and after the etching process, the protective tin layer on the copper tracks is also stripped off. so now, these copper tracks are also visible. so now, to protect these copper traces from the oxidation and environmental damage, a thin polymer coating is applied on the surface of the pcb. so this coating is known as the solder mask. so this solder mask can be of any color, but predominantly, the green color solder mask is used. because this green color is optimal for the manual as well as the automated visual inspection of the pcbs. so because of this solder mask, the pcbs which we are using and seeing are getting their green color. so after the application of this solder mask, a photo mask is applied and aligned to the pcb to cover all the solder pads, which will be later used for the soldering. and once all the solder pads are covered, then the solder mask is exposed to the uv light. so the transparent areas which are exposed to the uv light will get hardened. and the areas which are uv protected from those areas, the solder mask is then washed away. and now, the copper pads are visible once again. so now, on these exposed copper pads, a thin protective coating is applied to prevent the oxidation of the copper. so this process is known as the surface finish. so the surface finish not only protects the copper pads from the oxidation, but it also provides the good solder ability. so the different types of surface finish methods are used for the pcbs. but the most common one is the hasl, that is the hot air solder leveling. so in this process, a thin layer of the tin is coated on the copper pads. and after the surface finish, a silkscreen layer is applied. so in this silkscreening process, using the white epoxy ink, the component outlines, text and the logos are printed on the pcb. so through the silkscreening layer, anyone who is assembling the pcb can know that in which orientation the component should be mounted. so here on the pcb, the component outlines that is shown in the white colour represents the silkscreen layer. and after that, if the pcb is manufactured in the automated assembly, then the flying probe test is carried out to check the continuity of the electrical connections and to find out any open or shorts in the circuit. and after that, the final inspection is carried out. so this inspection can be either a manual visual inspection or it can be an automated optical inspection. and that is how the two-layer pcb is manufactured. now if you see the multi-layer pcb fabrication technique, then most of the steps remains the same. but this multi-layer pcb also involves few more fabrication steps for making the inner layers. but the fabrication steps for the outer layer are almost identical to the two-layer pcb fabrication. so here, let us understand the fabrication process of the multi-layer pcb and let us take the example of the four-layer pcb. so as we have seen, the four-layer pcb consists of the four conductive layers of the copper that are separated by the insulating layer. so in the four-layer pcb, or in general in the multi-layer pcb, the first thing that we have is the core, that is the central part of the pcb and it provides the mechanical strength and the support to the pcb. and around this core, the different copper layers are added. so here, this prepreg acts as an insulating layer and it isolates the different additional layers that are added around the core. so first, let us see the core. so this core structure is very similar to the fr4 structure, where in the center, we have a fiber-reinforced epoxy resin layer and around that we have the two copper layers. so in the multi-layer pcb design, first this core is prepared and once it is ready, then with the help of the prepreg, the other copper layers are bonded with the core. so here, this prepreg is a fiberglass cloth that is pre-impregnated with partially cured resin. so here, this prepreg acts as an adhesive layer and it also acts as an insulating layer between the core and the copper foils. so with the help of this prepreg, the other copper layers are bonded with the core and once all the layers are stacked up, then this assembled stack of the copper layers is placed in a vacuum heat press machine for a lamination under the high temperature and the pressure. so at this high temperature and the pressure, the resin inside the prepreg melts and it bonds all the layers together. and in this way, we have a single board, which consists of multiple layers of the copper. so this pcb manufacturing starts with the design of the gerber file. so here, the gerber files are standard digital files that defines every geometric detail of the pcbs layer, such as copper traces, solder mask openings, silkscreen graphics, drill locations, and the board outline. so for a specific circuit design, first these gerber files are created. and based on this created gerber file, the dfm check is run. so here, this dfm check evaluates this gerber and the other production files to confirm that the board can indeed be reliably fabricated and assembled with the given tolerance. and once the dfm check is alright, then first the inner layer imaging is carried out. that is creating the circuit pattern on the core. so first on the inner layer, a thin sheet of the photoresist is applied. and typically as we have seen, a negative photoresist material is used. that means when a part of the photoresist that is exposed to the uv gets hardened, while the other part remains soluble. so after the uv exposure, the softer part is removed. before that, first the photo mask is applied on the photoresist. now in case of the inner layer imaging, if you see the photo mask, then that is exactly opposite to the outer layer imaging mask. so here, where we want the copper tracks, those parts are kept transparent. so after the uv exposure, those parts will get hardened. so nowadays, in many multilayer pcb fabrication facilities, instead of using the photo mask, a laser direct imaging technique is used. so here, this ldi is the advanced technique in the pcb manufacturing, where a computer controlled laser is used to create the circuit pattern on the photoresist material without using the traditional photo mask. so in this case, the pcb areas where we want the copper track is exposed using the laser. and those parts will get hardened after the uv exposure. so this softer photoresist is first removed, and then through the etching process, the unwanted copper is removed. and after the removal of the copper, the hardened photoresist material is stripped off using the alkaline chemical solution. so from the top side, before the etching and stripping steps, this is how the pcb will look like. and once the unwanted copper is removed, and the photoresist material is stripped off, then this is how the pcb will look like. so of course, here only the top side is shown, but the same process also happens for the bottom side. and in this way, the inner layer imaging is carried out in the multilayer pcb. so once the inner layers are ready, then the other layers are added using the lamination process. so here, first prepreg is applied both on the top and the bottom side of the core. that acts as an insulating layer, and it also acts as an adhesive. and after that, as you have seen earlier, this assembled stack is placed in a vacuum heat press machine for the lamination under the high temperature and the high pressure. so once the lamination process is complete, then the processing for the outer layer is carried out. and as you have seen, this process is very similar to the procedure that we have seen for the two-sided pcb. so we have already seen those steps, but here let me just cover them for the continuity of the process. so here, once all the layers are stacked up and laminated, then first the drilling is carried out. so this drilling is carried out for the mounting holes as well as for the components and for all the through holes, which goes through all the layers of the pcb. so here, just for the representation purpose, only the top layer is shown

the drilled holes. and after this process, a thin photoresist layer is applied. so here, in this outer layer imaging, all the tracks and the copper pads where we want to do the copper plating, those regions are kept opaque in the photo mask. and the rest of the area is exposed to the uv light. so the areas that are exposed to the uv light gets hardened and those areas where the uv light is not falling will remain soft. so from those areas, the photoresist can be removed easily. and in this way, all the copper tracks and the holes where we want to do the copper plating will be visible. so many times, instead of using the photo mask, this step is directly done using the laser direct imaging. and after that, in the exposed area, the copper plating is carried out. so after this electroplating, to protect the plated copper tracks and the copper pads, a protective tin coating is applied using the electroplating method. and this method is similar to the electroplating method of the copper. so once this protective tin layer is applied, then after that, this hardened photoresist layer is stripped off using the alkaline chemical. so now, this unwanted copper is removed using the etching process. and after that, a protective tin layer on the tracks and the holes is also removed. and now, our required copper tracks and the copper pads are visible. so after this step, the solder mask is applied and using the photo mask, the required holes for the soldering are covered. so now, whenever this solder mask is exposed to the uv light, then due to the exposure of the uv light, the solder mask will get hardened. and the part of the solder mask, which is unexposed to the uv light is removed. or in a way, the solder mask from the copper pad is removed. so this step protects the copper tracks from the accidental solder bridges and the oxidation. and after this step, the surface finish is carried out on the copper pads for the better solderability of the components. and then comes the silkscreen step, where a white polymer ink is applied at the required locations on the pcb for the naming of the components as well as for the orientation and the polarity of the components. and after that, the final finishing and the visual inspection of the pcb is carried out. so these are the steps that are involved in the fabrication of the multi-layer pcb. so typically in the fabrication of the 4-layer pcb, to connect these 4 connecting layers, we have the through holes. and through these through holes, the different layers are electrically connected

components. so similarly, the third type of pcb is the multi-layer pcb, where we have more than two conductive layers. so here, since the internal layers do not occupy any component space, so these internal layers are only used for the signal routing. and that is why these pcbs provide much more component density. so these type of pcbs are preferred where we require the miniaturization or in the applications where we require the good signal integrity and reliability, such as in the high-speed and the high-frequency applications. so this classification of the pcbs is based on the number of layers. similarly, the pcbs are also classified based on their flexibility. so based on the flexibility, the one type of the pcb is the rigid pcb. so all the pcbs that we have discussed so far were the case of the rigid pcb. so as we have seen, these pcbs are built on the solid non-flexible substrate such as the fr4. so as it is the rigid pcb, so it retains its shape, and it also provides the good mechanical stability. then based on the flexibility, if we see the next type, then that is the flex pcb, or it is also known as the flexible pcb. so these pcbs can bend and fold in the compact spaces. so as we have seen, the base material in the rigid pcbs is the fiber-reinforced epoxy resin, and because of which, it remains sturdy. similarly in the flex pcbs, to get the required flexibility, the polyamide is used as the base material. so these pcbs are ultra-thin, lightweight, and they are adaptable to the complex geometries. and as they are flexible, so they provide the greater resistance to the vibration and the mechanical stress. so they are used in the applications where we require the flexibility, such as the display hinges in smartphones as well as in the fitness trackers. so so far, in terms of the flexibility, we have the two types of pcbs. that is the rigid pcb and the flex pcb. apart from that, we also have the rigid flex pcbs. so these pcbs combine both the rigid and the flexible sections in the single board layout. so these type of pcbs are used in the foldable devices, in high-end cameras, as well as they are also used in the aerospace and the defense applications. apart from that, they are also used in some implantable medical devices. so this is the classification of the pcbs based on their flexibility. so so far, we understood that what is pcb, why they are used, and what are the different types of pcbs. so now, lets understand how these pcbs are manufactured. so partly, we have seen that how the copper tracks of the electrical circuit are printed and etched on the insulating board. but now, lets understand the full process. and first, we will understand this process for the two-layer pcb. so for the two-layer pcb, first the fr4 board, which is laminated with the copper foils on both sides is taken. and then, the required drilling is carried out. so this drilling includes the drilling for the mounting holes, the through holes for the ics and other components, as well as the through holes to connect the copper traces on both sides. now as you can see, by default, these holes do not connect the two layers directly. so to make them conductive, and to establish the connection between the two layers, first the electroless copper plating is carried out. so this process is the chemical process, and it does not require any external power supply. so this process deposits a thin uniform copper layer on the non-conductive surface of the pcbs, including the through holes. and through this process, an electrical connection is established between the two layers. so this process makes the non-conductive surface conductive, and it creates the conductive seed layer for the next electroplating process, which further thickens the copper layers. but before this electroplating process, a thin layer of the photoresist is applied on this copper clad. and after that, a photomask is aligned on this photoresist material. so here we are assuming that the given photoresist is the negative photoresist. so here on this photomask, every one of the copper tracks will be kept opaque. and the rest of the area will be kept transparent. so now, after applying the photomask, when the photoresist is exposed to the uv light, then the photoresist area which is transparent to the uv light gets hardened. and the areas which are not exposed to the uv light will remain soluble. so on those parts, once the photoresist is removed, then the copper tracks will be visible. now to make these required tracks thicker, the electroplating process is carried out. so in this process, these pcbs are immersed in the electroplating bath, where the pcb acts as a cathode and the copper rod acts as anode. and now, the current is passed through this solution. so by controlling the current and the duration of the current, a uniform copper layer is deposited on the inner walls of the through hole as well as on the areas where we need the copper tracks. so now, to protect these copper tracks, a thin layer of the tin is coated using the electroplating process. so this process is similar to the electroplating process of the copper, but in this case, instead of the copper ions, now the tin ions will get deposited on the exposed area. and the area which is protected by the photoresist will remain as it is. so once the copper tracks are protected by this thin layer, then to remove this unwanted copper, first the photoresist material is stripped off. and it is stripped off using the chemical process. so then after, the pcb is submerged in the alkaline etching solution, which removes all the unwanted copper that is not protected by the tin plating. and now, the insulating layer of the substrate is visible from where the copper is removed. so this process of removing the unwanted copper is known as the etching process. and after the etching process, the protective tin layer on the copper tracks is also stripped off. so now, these copper tracks are also visible. so now, to protect these copper traces from the oxidation and environmental damage, a thin polymer coating is applied on the surface of the pcb. so this coating is known as the solder mask. so this solder mask can be of any color, but predominantly, the green color solder mask is used. because this green color is optimal for the manual as well as the automated visual inspection of the pcbs. so because of this solder mask, the pcbs which we are using and seeing are getting their green color. so after the application of this solder mask, a photo mask is applied and aligned to the pcb to cover all the solder pads, which will be later used for the soldering. and once all the solder pads are covered, then the solder mask is exposed to the uv light. so the transparent areas which are exposed to the uv light will get hardened. and the areas which are uv protected from those areas, the solder mask is then washed away. and now, the copper pads are visible once again. so now, on these exposed copper pads, a thin protective coating is applied to prevent the oxidation of the copper. so this process is known as the surface finish. so the surface finish not only protects the copper pads from the oxidation, but it also provides the good solder ability. so the different types of surface finish methods are used for the pcbs. but the most common one is the hasl, that is the hot air solder leveling. so in this process, a thin layer of the tin is coated on the copper pads. and after the surface finish, a silkscreen layer is applied. so in this silkscreening process, using the white epoxy ink, the component outlines, text and the logos are printed on the pcb. so through the silkscreening layer, anyone who is assembling the pcb can know that in which orientation the component should be mounted. so here on the pcb, the component outlines that is shown in the white colour represents the silkscreen layer. and after that, if the pcb is manufactured in the automated assembly, then the flying probe test is carried out to check the continuity of the electrical connections and to find out any open or shorts in the circuit. and after that, the final inspection is carried out. so this inspection can be either a manual visual inspection or it can be an automated optical inspection. and that is how the two-layer pcb is manufactured. now if you see the multi-layer pcb fabrication technique, then most of the steps remains the same. but this multi-layer pcb also involves few more fabrication steps for making the inner layers. but the fabrication steps for the outer layer are almost identical to the two-layer pcb fabrication. so here, let us understand the fabrication process of the multi-layer pcb and let us take the example of the four-layer pcb. so as we have seen, the four-layer pcb consists of the four conductive layers of the copper that are separated by the insulating layer. so in the four-layer pcb, or in general in the multi-layer pcb, the first thing that we have is the core, that is the central part of the pcb and it provides the mechanical strength and the support to the pcb. and around this core, the different copper layers are added. so here, this prepreg acts as an insulating layer and it isolates the different additional layers that are added around the core. so first, let us see the core. so this core structure is very similar to the fr4 structure, where in the center, we have a fiber-reinforced epoxy resin layer and around that we have the two copper layers. so in the multi-layer pcb design, first this core is prepared and once it is ready, then with the help of the prepreg, the other copper layers are bonded with the core. so here, this prepreg is a fiberglass cloth that is pre-impregnated with partially cured resin. so here, this prepreg acts as an adhesive layer and it also acts as an insulating layer between the core and the copper foils. so with the help of this prepreg, the other copper layers are bonded with the core and once all the layers are stacked up, then this assembled stack of the copper layers is placed in a vacuum heat press machine for a lamination under the high temperature and the pressure. so at this high temperature and the pressure, the resin inside the prepreg melts and it bonds all the layers together. and in this way, we have a single board, which consists of multiple layers of the copper. so this pcb manufacturing starts with the design of the gerber file. so here, the gerber files are standard digital files that defines every geometric detail of the pcbs layer, such as copper traces, solder mask openings, silkscreen graphics, drill locations, and the board outline. so for a specific circuit design, first these gerber files are created. and based on this created gerber file, the dfm check is run. so here, this dfm check evaluates this gerber and the other production files to confirm that the board can indeed be reliably fabricated and assembled with the given tolerance. and once the dfm check is alright, then first the inner layer imaging is carried out. that is creating the circuit pattern on the core. so first on the inner layer, a thin sheet of the photoresist is applied. and typically as we have seen, a negative photoresist material is used. that means when a part of the photoresist that is exposed to the uv gets hardened, while the other part remains soluble. so after the uv exposure, the softer part is removed. before that, first the photo mask is applied on the photoresist. now in case of the inner layer imaging, if you see the photo mask, then that is exactly opposite to the outer layer imaging mask. so here, where we want the copper tracks, those parts are kept transparent. so after the uv exposure, those parts will get hardened. so nowadays, in many multilayer pcb fabrication facilities, instead of using the photo mask, a laser direct imaging technique is used. so here, this ldi is the advanced technique in the pcb manufacturing, where a computer controlled laser is used to create the circuit pattern on the photoresist material without using the traditional photo mask. so in this case, the pcb areas where we want the copper track is exposed using the laser. and those parts will get hardened after the uv exposure. so this softer photoresist is first removed, and then through the etching process, the unwanted copper is removed. and after the removal of the copper, the hardened photoresist material is stripped off using the alkaline chemical solution. so from the top side, before the etching and stripping steps, this is how the pcb will look like. and once the unwanted copper is removed, and the photoresist material is stripped off, then this is how the pcb will look like. so of course, here only the top side is shown, but the same process also happens for the bottom side. and in this way, the inner layer imaging is carried out in the multilayer pcb. so once the inner layers are ready, then the other layers are added using the lamination process. so here, first prepreg is applied both on the top and the bottom side of the core. that acts as an insulating layer, and it also acts as an adhesive. and after that, as you have seen earlier, this assembled stack is placed in a vacuum heat press machine for the lamination under the high temperature and the high pressure. so once the lamination process is complete, then the processing for the outer layer is carried out. and as you have seen, this process is very similar to the procedure that we have seen for the two-sided pcb. so we have already seen those steps, but here let me just cover them for the continuity of the process. so here, once all the layers are stacked up and laminated, then first the drilling is carried out. so this drilling is carried out for the mounting holes as well as for the components and for all the through holes, which goes through all the layers of the pcb. so here, just for the representation purpose, only the top layer is shown in the 3d view. so after the drilling, the next step is the desmearing, which is the cleaning process that removes the resin smear and the drilling debris from the walls of the drilled hole. and after that, this electroless copper deposition is carried out to make the non-conductive inner walls of the drilled holes conductive. so this process forms the conductive seed layer on the inner walls of the drilled holes. and after this process, a thin photoresist layer is applied. so here, in this outer layer imaging, all the tracks and the copper pads where we want to do the copper plating, those regions are kept opaque in the photo mask. and the rest of the area is exposed to the uv light. so the areas that are exposed to the uv light gets hardened and those areas where the uv light is not falling will remain soft. so from those areas, the photoresist can be removed easily. and in this way, all the copper tracks and the holes where we want to do the copper plating will be visible. so many times, instead of using the photo mask, this step is directly done using the laser direct imaging. and after that, in the exposed area, the copper plating is carried out. so after this electroplating, to protect the plated copper tracks and the copper pads, a protective tin coating is applied using the electroplating method. and this method is similar to the electroplating method of the copper. so once this protective tin layer is applied, then after that, this hardened photoresist layer is stripped off using the alkaline chemical. so now, this unwanted copper is removed using the etching process. and after that, a protective tin layer on the tracks and the holes is also removed. and now, our required copper tracks and the copper pads are visible. so after this step, the solder mask is applied and using the photo mask, the required holes for the soldering are covered. so now, whenever this solder mask is exposed to the uv light, then due to the exposure of the uv light, the solder mask will get hardened. and the part of the solder mask, which is unexposed to the uv light is removed. or in a way, the solder mask from the copper pad is removed. so this step protects the copper tracks from the accidental solder bridges and the oxidation. and after this step, the surface finish is carried out on the copper pads for the better solderability of the components. and then comes the silkscreen step, where a white polymer ink is applied at the required locations on the pcb for the naming of the components as well as for the orientation and the polarity of the components. and after that, the final finishing and the visual inspection of the pcb is carried out. so these are the steps that are involved in the fabrication of the multi-layer pcb. so typically in the fabrication of the 4-layer pcb, to connect these 4 connecting layers, we have the through holes. and through these through holes, the different layers are electrically connected with each other. but many times, when we go for the 6-layer or even higher layer pcbs that are commonly used in the high-density circuits and in the high-speed applications in those pcbs, many times these different layers are connected through the different wires. so regarding that, we will cover it in the separate video. but i hope in this video, you understood what is pcb, why it is called the printed circuit board and you also understood why these pcbs are used. then after, we also understood that what are

GHQ8vbOZMnI,What is Zero PCB ? Why it is used? How Zero PCB is made ? #pcbs,2025-09-09 17:03:45+00:00,2025,9,Tuesday,"In this short video, let us understand what is zero PCB which is sometimes also referred by the other names such as dot PCB and the general purpose PCB. So the zero PCB is a pre-manufactured PCB which has a grid of holes and around each hole the isolated copper pads are provided for the manual soldering. So unlike the standard PCB, the zero PCB does not have the predefined layout. And in this PCB user manually interconnects the components using the wires and the solder bridges. So mainly this zero PCB is used for prototyping or testing the circuit design before the final fabrication and it is also used in the educational projects and the training environments. Apart from that it is also used by the hobbyist in the DIY projects. Moreover, the zero PCB is also useful for testing any circuit or the design modification. So, let us quickly see how the zero PCB is made. So, in this zero PCB, the base material is either phenolic resin or the F FR4 which is the insulating layer and it is basically a fiberglass based reinforced epoxy resin. Now if the zero PCB is a one-sided PCB then it has the copper lamination only on the one side. So in this one-sided zero PCB it will form the bottom side of the PCB. Now on this copper plane to create this copper pads through the etching process this unwanted copper is removed and now through either drilling or the punching the holes are created in this isolated copper pads and in this way this PCB is created. So on the top side the components are connected while on the bottom side there we have these copper pads on that side the components are interconnected by using the wires. So similar to the one-sided zero PCB there is also a two-sided zero PCB. So in this PCB it is possible to connect the wires on both sides. Now the advantage of the zero PCB is that it is very cost effective and moreover it also allows the easy customization where it is easy to modify the design or it is easy to change the circuit components. But the downside is that typically they are not durable as the standard PCB. Moreover, here the component soldering and the connection between them is also done manually. Not only that the zero PCBs have the higher parasitic capacitance and the poor impedance control and that is why it will not give the good performance at the high frequency. Moreover, as they are manually soldered so to get the repeatable performance on the other boards is also difficult. So mainly they are used for the prototyping and in the final design the standard PCBs are",what is zero pcb ? why it is used? how zero pcb is made ? pcbs,"in this short video, let us understand what

zQfhn1jyePY,How Schottky Diode is Different from Normal Diode? #allaboutelectronics,2025-09-02 19:06:10+00:00,2025,9,Tuesday,"In this short video, let us understand  how the Schottky diode is different from   the normal PN junction diode. So if  you see the normal PN junction diode,   then it is made up of the P-type and the N-  type semiconductor materials. And therefore,   if you see the voltage across its two terminals,  then its forward voltage drop is typically 0.6 to   0.7 volt. On the other end, as the Schottky diode  has the metal semiconductor junction, so its forward   voltage drop is typically 0.3 to 0.4 volt. Moreover,  the switching speed of the Schottky diode is   also higher than the normal PN junction diode.  Because as you know, in case of the normal diode,   the flow of current is due to both minority as  well as the majority charge carriers and because   of that, we have a issue of the charge storage.  That means whenever we suddenly reverse the   voltage across the diode then the current through  the diode will not become zero immediately. And it   will take some finite time until the stored charge  across the diode gets removed and therefore this   normal PN junction diode turns off slowly. But  in case of the Schottky diode, as we have metal on   the one side, and the semiconductor material on the  other side, so here the flow of current is only   due to the majority charge carriers. And due to  that the Schottky diode has a faster reverse   recovery time as well as the faster switching. So  because of its lower forward voltage drop and the   higher switching speed, the Schottky diodes are  used in the high power applications where the   efficiency is required, as well as they are also  used in the fast switching applications. So these   Schottky diodes are commonly used in the SMPS as  well as the DC to DC converters. Similarly, they   are also used in the battery powered systems where  we want to block the reverse current. Likewise,   due to their faster switching speed, they are also  used in the RF mixture as well as the detector   circuits. Not only that they are also used in  the solar panel as a blocking diode, so that it   can prevent the back current that is coming from  the battery towards the solar panel side. Now the   only drawback of this Schottky diode is that it  has the higher reverse leakage current. Moreover,   as you can see from its VI characteristic, it  has the lower reverse breakdown voltage than the   normal diode. And that is why they are preferred  in the low voltage, fast switching and the high   efficiency circuits. And for more information  about the Schottky diode, you can check this video.",how schottky diode is different from normal diode? allaboutelectronics,"in this short video, let us understand how the

6UrTvTjGR4Q,"Different IC Packages Explained | DIP, SOIC, QFP, QFN and BGA Packages Explained",2025-08-21 15:20:30+00:00,2025,8,Thursday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the different IC packages that are commonly used in the electronics. So if you see these IC packages, then that is basically a protective case around the integrated circuit. So this protective case protects the chip from the dust, moisture, and physical damage. And the second and one of the most important thing is that it connects the chip to  the outside world using either pins, leads, or the bumps. And the third thing is that this IC package removes the heat from the IC  whenever it is in the working condition. So in the electronic industry, different types of IC packages are used. Like the DIP, SOIC, QFP, and the BGA. And looking at all these different packages, the first question that arises in our mind is like why these different IC packages exist. And the reason is that each package is meant for the different application and the needs. So depending on the required performance and the application,  the different IC packages are used. Similarly, in some applications where the size and the cost is a constraint,  accordingly, the different packages are used. Likewise, depending on the required thermal management and the required  output pins, the different packages are selected for the different applications. So in this video, we will learn about the commonly used packages in detail, and we will also see that in what type of application these different types of IC packages are preferred. So first, let's start with the DIP package. So this DIP means the Dual Inline Package. So if you see this DIP package, that it is the through hole package. So in this through hole package, the leads extend out from the bottom of the package And they are designed to go through the holes that is drilled in the PCB. So nowadays, many ICs are not supporting this DIP package. But this IC package is still used in some legacy applications and commonly it is used for the fast prototyping, specifically when we want to do the  fast prototyping using the breadboard. Moreover, this package is also used in the education as well as the training kits. Because in this IC package, using the readily available sockets,  it is possible to swap the ICs. Moreover, this package is also preferred in the low-cost applications. So this IC package supports the pin count in the range of 6 to 64. That means minimum 6 pins and the maximum 64 pin ICs are available in this package. And the different op-amps, microcontroller, and the logic ICs are still available in this DIP package. Now the main disadvantage of this DIP package is that the overall footprint of the  package is larger than the other packages. And here, as the pins are larger and longer, so the lead inductance is also higher. And because of that, the ICs that are available in this DIP package  are not suitable for the high-speed applications. And not only that, to use this package with the PCBs, you also need to make the holes in the PCBs. So these are the few disadvantages of the DIP package. So similar to the DIP package, we also have the SIP package,  which is known as the single in-line package. So in case of the DIP package, we have seen that the pins are arranged in two rows. So in this SIP package, the pins are arranged in the single row. So this package is used very less nowadays, but still it is used in some resistive or the capacitive networks, as well as it is also used in some DC to DC converters. And if you see the early memory modules, then they were also using this SIP package. So similar to the DIP package, this package is also a through-hole package. And apart from this SIP and the DIP, there is another package which is also a  through-hole package, that is the pin grid array package. So as its name suggests, in this package, the pins of the components are arranged in a grid-like pattern on the bottom side of the package. So in this package, as most of the bottom part of the package is used for the pins, so this package provides much more pin contacts compared to the DIP and the SIP package. And mainly, this package is used with the sockets. So that the chip can be easily inserted, removed or upgraded without the soldering. So this package is typically used for some microprocessor CPUs, as well as for some DSPs and FPGAs, where the easy replacement is required during the development as well as the deployment. So you will find this PGA package in some old generation Intel as well as the AMD CPUs. And in fact, some current generation Ryzen CPUs are also using this PGA package. For example, the AMD's Ryzen 5000 series CPUs are also using this PGA package. And this is the photo of the compatible socket. So the clear advantage of this PGA package is that it offers the easy installation, replacement as well as the upgrade of the chip via socket. Moreover, since the PGA package is also using the through-hole packet technology, so when the chip is inserted into the socket, then that provides the good mechanical strength. But the only disadvantage of this package is that the alignment is very critical. Because during the insertion or removal, the pins can bend or break. And therefore, it requires careful alignment. So, as we have seen, this DIP, SIP, and the PGA are the example of the through-hole packages. And similar to these packages, most of the TO packages or the variants of the  TO packages are also available in the through-hole packages. So let's also briefly talk about this TO package. So here, this TO package refers to the Transistor Outline package. So this package is mainly used for the discrete components. So of course, although its name suggests that it is only meant for the transistors, but actually it is used for all the discrete components like the BJT MOSFETs, rectifiers and the diodes, as well as the voltage regulators and the power ICs. So there are different TO package variants, and each variant is used for a special purpose. For example, this TO-247 is meant for the high-power MOSFETs and the IGBTs. Likewise, this TO-3 is the metal CAN package, and it is mainly used for the  very high-power transistors. Similarly, this TO-92 is the 3-pin package, and it is mainly used for the low-power transistors, sensors as well as the regulators. And likewise, this TO-220 package is mainly used for the voltage regulators  like the 7805 and the 7815. So as I said earlier, most of the TO package variants are available in the through-hole package. But there are some variants of the TO package  that are also available in the surface mount package. So as we have seen so far, most of the through-hole packages like the DIP, SIP  or even TO packages have the larger footprint. And therefore, they are not suitable for the compact designs. Moreover, as I said earlier, these through-hole packages also require drilling in the PCB. And that's why they are not suitable for the automation-based assembly. So in applications where the overall small footprint is required, or where the automation-based component assembly is required, in such cases, the surface mount packages are used. So now, let's see the different types of surface mount packages. So as its name suggests, the surface mount packages are  mounted directly on the surface of the PCB. And compared to the through-hole packages, the surface mount packages  allow much more compact design. Moreover, as the components are mounted on the surface of the PCB, so these packages are also suitable for the automated component assembly and the manufacturing. So there are different types of surface mount packages like the  SOIC or SOP, QFP, QFN and the BGA. So in this video, we will learn about all these packages. But first of all, let's start with the SOIC and SOP package. So here, the SOP refers to the Small Outline Package. And similarly, the SOIC refers to the Small Outline Integrated Circuit. So here, the term SOIC and SOP is often used interchangeably. But both packages refer to the Small Outline Package. And these packages occupy 30-40% less space compared to the DIP packages. And that is the main reason they have replaced the DIP packages in the modern PCBs. So both these packages are the two-sided packages, meaning that the leads are arranged  in a row on both sides of the package. And these packages are using the gull-wing kind of leads. So in these packages, if we see the pin count, then it ranges from the 8-pin to the 64-pin. That means the ICs with the 6-pin to the 64-pins are available in these packages. So in these packages, of course the lead length is little shorter than the through-hole packages, but still it is of the moderate length. And because of that, these packages have the higher inductance. And that is why they are not suitable for the high-speed application. So because of its smaller footprint, the conventional ICs, like the logic ICs, op-amps and other general-purpose ICs, which were earlier available in the DIP package,  are now mostly available in these SOIC and SOP packages. So earlier I have said that the terms SOIC and SOP are often used interchangeably in the electronic industry. But there is a minor difference between this SOIC and SOP package. So basically, this SOP is the broader category of the small outline package. While if you see the SOIC, then it is a specific type within the small outline package. So as we have seen, both these IC packages are using the Gull-wing kind of lead. But the main difference between these two packages is in terms of the width of the  package as well as the lead pitch. So typically, these SOP packages are available in the different versions. Like the S-SOP, T-SOP, and the TS-SOP. So for example, this S-SOP refers to the shrinked version of the standard SOP package. So in this version, the body width has been reduced compared to the standard package. Likewise, there is another version called the T-SOP. That is the thinner version of the standard SOP package. So in this package, the height of the package is smaller compared to the standard SOP package. And likewise, there is another version called the TS-SOP. That is the thinner and the shrinked version of the standard SOP package. On the other end, in the SOIC package, we have only two versions. That is narrow and the wide SOIC package. So if you want to know more about it, then you can pause the video and check this  table for more information. So similar to the SOIC and the SOP package, another surface mount package is the SOT package. So basically, it is the surface mount version of the TO package. So earlier we have seen that in the TO package,  most of the variants are the through-hole package. But this SOT is the surface mount version of the TO packages that is available in the smaller footprint. And similar to the TO package, this package is mainly used for the discrete components. So in this SOT package, the 3-pin package is the most common. But typically, the pin count in this package can vary from the 3-pin to the 8-pin. So similar to the SOIC and SOP package, these SOT package ICs are also using the Gull-wing kind of leads In some variants of this SOT package, there is also an additional thermal pad for the better thermal management. So similar to the different TO packages, the different SOT packages exist for the different needs. For example, the SOT-523 package is mainly used for the ultra-miniature devices. Likewise, the SOT-323 is mainly used for the small-signal transistors and the diodes. Similarly, the SOT-23 package is mainly used for the general-purpose transistors,  regulators and the amplifiers. And likewise, the SOT-89 and the SOT-223 packages are used  for the power transistors and the voltage regulators. And likewise, if you see the SOT-143 package, then mainly it is used  for the dual transistors or the matched pairs. So in this way, the different SOT packages are used for the different needs. So as I said earlier, this package is typically used for the discrete semiconductor  components like the diode, MOSFET, and the transistors. But apart from that, it is also used for the other components like the voltage regulators, comparators, opto-isolators, and the other similar devices. And as we know, all these different components are used in all sorts of applications,  like from the consumer electronics to the signal processing. And similarly, it is also used in many industrial controls. So similarly, now let's see the next type of surface mount package, that is the QFP. So here, this QFP refers to the quad-flat package. So in case of the SOP or the SOIC, we have seen that the leads are arranged  in two rows on the two sides of the package. But this QFP is the four-sided package. That means in this package, the leads are there on all four sides of the package. And similar to the SOIC package, this package is also using the Gull-wing kind of leads. So for this package, the pin count ranges from the 64 pins to the 256 pins. And this package is typically used for the microcontrollers, DSPs as well as the ASICs. Now when there is a space constraint, then in such applications, the thinner version of this package is also used. So this version is known as the TQFP, that is the thin QFP package. So this version has a lesser height compared to the standard version. So similar to the SOIC package, as this package is also using the Gull-wing kind of leads. So due to the relatively higher lead lengths, the lead inductance is also higher. And because of that, this package is not suitable for the very high frequency applications. Moreover, in higher pin count QFP packages, as the leads are very near to each other, so due to that, the soldering complexity increases. So these are the few disadvantages of this package. So similar to the QFP package, there is also another package that is known as the QFN. And this QFN package is also a surface-mount package. So here, this QFN stands for the quad-flat no-lead package. So as its name suggests, this package does not have any leads, but it has flat contact pads on all four sides. So this package is available in the square as well as the rectangular form. So in this package, the semiconductor chip sits on the center and through the wire bonds, the connections are provided on the flat contact pads. And then, these contact pads are soldered on the PCB. So this package is available in the very small form factor. And if you see the pin count for this package, then it ranges from the 8-pin to the 100-pin. Now the advantage of this package is that it is very compact in the low profile. Moreover, on the bottom side of this package, in the center there is a metal pad. And this pad directly comes in contact with the PCB. And due to that, it helps in dissipating the heat efficiently. So that is the reason this package provides excellent heat dissipation. Moreover, as this package does not have any leads, so the contact pads on this  package offers the lower inductance. And due to that, this package is ideal for the high frequency and the high speed applications. Moreover, being the surface mount package, this package is also suitable for the  automatic assembling of the components. So these are the few advantages of this QFN package. Now the only difficulty with this package is that, as the solder joints are under the package, so through the visual inspection, we cannot see the soldering. And therefore, to check whether the soldering is happening correctly or not,  we need the X-ray inspection. So if you see this QFN package, then it is used in various applications like in the smartphone and wireless modules for the various components. Similarly, many microcontrollers are also available in this package. Likewise, many power management ICs and many RF circuit components  are also available in this package. So similar to the QFN package, we also have the DFN package,  which is known as the dual-flat no lead package. So in case of the QFN package, we have seen that the package had the pads on all 4 sides. So similarly, this DFN package has the contact pads only on the 2 sides. So if you see the pin count or the number of contact points for this package,  then it is in the range of 3 to 32. And this DFN package has an even smaller footprint compared to the QFN package. So these are the different applications where these DFN packages are used. So this DFN and QFN are the no lead packages, which are available in the small form factor. So similarly, let's see another surface-mount package, which is nowadays commonly used when the high pin density is required in a compact form factor. So this package is known as the BGA package, that is the ball grid array package. So if you see this BGA package, then it is evolved from the pin grid array package. So this package has replaced the protruding pins of the PGA package  by the solder balls underneath the package. And as you can see in this image, these solder balls are arranged in the grid-like pattern. So that is why this package is known as the ball grid array. So the design of this package allows the entire bottom surface to be used for the connections rather than the perimeter. And therefore, it allows the much higher pin densities. So this package can accommodate more I-O connections in a smaller footprint  compared to the perimeter-only packages like the QFP and the DIPU. So in this package, the internal traces from the dies to the solder balls  are shorter than the other peripheral packages. And therefore, it has the lower contact inductance and the resistance. So that is why this package is suitable for the very high frequency and the high speed applications. Moreover, here as the entire bottom surface is contributing in the heat transfer,  so this package provides the better heat dissipation. Now the only downside of this package is that as the solder balls are beneath the package, so the visual inspection of the soldered connection is not possible. And therefore, for the inspection, it requires the special X-ray equipment. So this BGA package is typically used for the components   which require the higher pin count in the small form factor. Like the microprocessors, GPUs, digital signal processors, as well as the  high-performance microcontrollers, RAM modules and the FPGAs. And as we know, these components are commonly used in consumer electronics and  many high end telecommunication and signal processing equipments. So that is all regarding the BGA package. So if I just summarize, then we have seen the broadly two types of IC packages. That is the through-hole package and the surface mount package. And in that also, we have seen the different variants. So I hope in this video, you understood about the different IC packages, and you also  learned why different IC packages exist, and in what type of application  certain IC packages are used. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below.

to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the different ic packages that are commonly used in the electronics. so if you see these ic packages, then that is basically a protective case around the integrated circuit. so this protective case protects the chip from the dust, moisture, and physical damage. and the second and one of the most important thing is that it connects the chip to the outside world using either pins, leads, or the bumps. and the third thing is that this ic package removes the heat from the ic whenever it is in the working condition. so in the electronic industry, different types of ic packages are used. like the dip, soic, qfp, and the bga. and looking at all these different packages, the first question that arises in our mind is like why these different ic packages exist. and the reason is that each package is meant for the different application and the needs. so depending on the required performance and the application, the different ic packages are used. similarly, in some applications where the size and the cost is a constraint, accordingly, the different packages are used. likewise, depending on the required thermal management and the required output pins, the different packages are selected for the different applications. so in this video, we will learn about the commonly used packages in detail, and we will also see that in what type of application these different types of ic packages are preferred. so first, lets start with the dip package. so this dip means the dual inline package. so if you see this dip package, that it is the through hole package. so in this through hole package, the leads extend out from the bottom of the package and they are designed to go through the holes that is drilled in the pcb. so nowadays, many ics are not supporting this dip package. but this ic package is still used in some legacy applications and commonly it is used for the fast prototyping, specifically when we want to do the fast prototyping using the breadboard. moreover, this package is also used in the education as well as the training kits. because in this ic package, using the readily available sockets, it is possible to swap the ics. moreover, this package is also preferred in the low-cost applications. so this ic package supports the pin count in the range of 6 to 64. that means minimum 6 pins and the maximum 64 pin ics are available in this package. and the different op-amps, microcontroller, and the logic ics are still available in this dip package. now the main disadvantage of this dip package is that the overall footprint of the package is larger than the other packages. and here, as the pins are larger and longer, so the lead inductance is also higher. and because of that, the ics that are available in this dip package are not suitable for the high-speed applications. and not only that, to use this package with the pcbs, you also need to make the holes in the pcbs. so these are the few disadvantages of the dip package. so similar to the dip package, we also have the sip package, which is known as the single in-line package. so in case of the dip package, we have seen that the pins are arranged in two rows. so in this sip package, the pins are arranged in the single row. so this package is used very less nowadays, but still it is used in some resistive or the capacitive networks, as well as it is also used in some dc to dc converters. and if you see the early memory modules, then they were also using this sip package. so similar to the dip package, this package is also a through-hole package. and apart from this sip and the dip, there is another package which is also a through-hole package, that is the pin grid array package. so as its name suggests, in this package, the pins of the components are arranged in a grid-like pattern on the bottom side of the package. so in this package, as most of the bottom part of the package is used for the pins, so this package provides much more pin contacts compared to the dip and the sip package. and mainly, this package is used with the sockets. so that the chip can be easily inserted, removed or upgraded without the soldering. so this package is typically used for some microprocessor cpus, as well as for some dsps and fpgas, where the easy replacement is required during the development as well as the deployment. so you will find this pga package in some old generation intel as well as the amd cpus. and in fact, some current generation ryzen cpus are also using this pga package. for example, the amds ryzen 5000 series cpus are also using this pga package. and this is the photo of the compatible socket. so the clear advantage of this pga package is that it offers the easy installation, replacement as well as the upgrade of the chip via socket. moreover, since the pga package is also using the through-hole packet technology, so when the chip is inserted into the socket, then that provides the good mechanical strength. but the only disadvantage of this package is that the alignment is very critical. because during the insertion or removal, the pins can bend or break. and therefore, it requires careful alignment. so, as we have seen, this dip, sip, and the pga are the example of the through-hole packages. and similar to these packages, most of the to packages or the variants of the to packages are also available in the through-hole packages. so lets also briefly talk about this to package. so here, this to package refers to the transistor outline package. so this package is mainly used for the discrete components. so of course, although its name suggests that it is only meant for the transistors, but actually it is used for all the discrete components like the bjt mosfets, rectifiers and the diodes, as well as the voltage regulators and the power ics. so there are different to package variants, and each variant is used for a special purpose. for example, this to-247 is meant for the high-power mosfets and the igbts. likewise, this to-3 is the metal can package, and it is mainly used for the very high-power transistors. similarly, this to-92 is the 3-pin package, and it is mainly used for the low-power transistors, sensors as well as the regulators. and likewise, this to-220 package is mainly used for the voltage regulators like the 7805 and the 7815. so as i said earlier, most of the to package variants are available in the through-hole package. but there are some variants of the to package that are also available in the surface mount package. so as we have seen so far, most of the through-hole packages like the dip, sip or even to packages have the larger footprint. and therefore, they are not suitable for the compact designs. moreover, as i said earlier, these through-hole packages also require drilling in the pcb. and thats why they are not suitable for the automation-based assembly. so in applications where the overall small footprint is required, or where the automation-based component assembly is required, in such cases, the surface mount packages are used. so now, lets see the different types of surface mount packages. so as its name suggests, the surface mount packages are mounted directly on the surface of the pcb. and compared to the through-hole packages, the surface mount packages allow much more compact design. moreover, as the components are mounted on the surface of the pcb, so these packages are also suitable for the automated component assembly and the manufacturing. so there are different types of surface mount packages like the soic or sop, qfp, qfn and the bga. so in this video, we will learn about all these packages. but first of all, lets start with the soic and sop package. so here, the sop refers to the small outline package. and similarly, the soic refers to the small outline integrated circuit. so here, the term soic and sop is often used interchangeably. but both packages refer to the small outline package. and these packages occupy 30-40 less space compared to the dip packages. and that is the main reason they have replaced the dip packages in the modern pcbs. so both these packages are the two-sided packages, meaning that the leads are arranged in a row on both sides of the package. and these packages are using the gull-wing kind of leads. so in these packages, if we see the pin count, then it ranges from the 8-pin to the 64-pin. that means the ics with the 6-pin to the 64-pins are available in these packages. so in these packages, of course the lead length is little shorter than the through-hole packages, but still it is of the moderate length. and because of that, these packages have the higher inductance. and that is why they are not suitable for the high-speed application. so because of its smaller footprint, the conventional ics, like the logic ics, op-amps and other general-purpose ics, which were earlier available in the dip package, are now mostly available in these soic and sop packages. so earlier i have said that the terms soic and sop are often used interchangeably in the electronic industry. but there is a minor difference between this soic and sop package. so basically, this sop is the broader category of the small outline package. while if you see the soic, then it is a specific type within the small outline package. so as we have seen, both these ic packages are using the gull-wing kind of lead. but the main difference between these two packages is in terms of the width of the package as well as the lead pitch. so typically, these sop packages are available in the different versions. like the s-sop, t-sop, and the ts-sop. so for example, this s-sop refers to the shrinked version of the standard sop package. so in this version, the body width has been reduced compared to the standard package. likewise, there is another version called the t-sop. that is the thinner version of the standard sop package. so in this package, the height of the package is smaller compared to the standard sop package. and likewise, there is another version called the ts-sop. that is the thinner and the shrinked version of the standard sop package. on the other end, in the soic package, we have only two versions. that is narrow and the wide soic package. so if you want to know more about it, then you can pause the video and check this table for more information. so similar to the soic and the sop package, another surface mount package is the sot package. so basically, it is the surface mount version of the to package. so earlier we have seen that in the to package, most of the variants are the through-hole package. but this sot is the surface mount version of the to packages that is available in the smaller footprint. and similar to the to package, this package is mainly used for the discrete components. so in this sot package, the 3-pin package is the most common. but typically, the pin count in this package can vary from the 3-pin to the 8-pin. so similar to the soic and sop package, these sot package ics are also using the gull-wing kind of leads in some variants of this sot package, there is also an additional thermal pad for the better thermal management. so similar to the different to packages, the different sot packages exist for the different needs. for example, the sot-523 package is mainly used for the ultra-miniature devices. likewise, the sot-323 is mainly used for the small-signal transistors and the diodes. similarly, the sot-23 package is mainly used for the general-purpose transistors, regulators and the amplifiers. and likewise, the sot-89 and the sot-223 packages are used for the power transistors and the voltage regulators. and likewise, if you see the sot-143 package, then mainly it is used for the dual transistors or the matched pairs. so in this way, the different sot packages are used for the different needs. so as i said earlier, this package is typically used for the discrete semiconductor components like the diode, mosfet, and the transistors. but apart from that, it is also used for the other components like the voltage regulators, comparators, opto-isolators, and the other similar devices. and as we know, all these different components are used in all sorts of applications, like from the consumer electronics to the signal processing. and similarly, it is also used in many industrial controls. so similarly, now lets see the next type of surface mount package, that is the qfp. so here, this qfp refers to the quad-flat package. so in case of the sop or the soic, we have seen that the leads are arranged in two rows on the two sides of the package. but this qfp is the four-sided package. that means in this package, the leads are there on all four sides of the package. and similar to the soic package, this package is also using the gull-wing kind of leads. so for this package, the pin count ranges from the 64 pins to the 256 pins. and this package is typically used for the microcontrollers, dsps as well as the asics. now when there is a space constraint, then in such applications, the thinner version of this package is also used. so this version is known as the tqfp, that is the thin qfp package. so this version has a lesser height compared to the standard version. so similar to the soic package, as this package is also using the gull-wing kind of leads. so due to the relatively higher lead lengths, the lead inductance is also higher. and because of that, this package is not suitable for the very high frequency applications. moreover, in higher pin count qfp packages, as the leads are very near to each other, so due to that, the soldering complexity increases. so these are the few disadvantages of this package. so similar to the qfp package, there is also another package that is known as the qfn. and this qfn package is also a surface-mount package. so here, this qfn stands for the quad-flat no-lead package. so as its name suggests, this package does not have any leads, but it has flat contact pads on all four sides. so this package is available in the square as well as the rectangular form. so in this package, the semiconductor chip sits on the center and through the wire bonds, the connections are provided on the flat contact pads. and then, these contact pads are soldered on the pcb. so this package is available in the very small form factor. and if you see the pin count for this package, then it ranges from the 8-pin to the 100-pin. now the advantage of this package is that it is very compact in the low profile. moreover, on the bottom side of this package, in the center there is a metal pad. and this pad directly comes in contact with the pcb. and due to that, it helps in dissipating the heat efficiently. so that is the reason this package provides excellent heat dissipation. moreover, as this package does not have any leads, so the contact pads on this package offers the lower inductance. and due to that, this package is ideal for the high frequency and the high speed applications. moreover, being the surface mount package, this package is also suitable for the automatic assembling of the components. so these are the few advantages of this qfn package. now the only difficulty with this package is that, as the solder joints are under the package, so through the visual inspection, we cannot see the soldering. and therefore, to check whether the soldering is happening correctly or not, we need the x-ray inspection. so if you see this qfn package, then it is used in various applications like in the smartphone and wireless modules for the various components. similarly, many microcontrollers are also available in this package. likewise, many power management ics and many rf circuit components are also available in this package. so similar to the qfn package, we also have the dfn package, which is known as the dual-flat no lead package. so in case of the qfn package, we have seen that the package had the pads on all 4 sides. so similarly, this dfn package has the contact pads only on the 2 sides. so if you see the pin count or the number of contact points for this package, then it is in the range of 3 to 32. and this dfn package has an even smaller footprint compared to the qfn package. so these are the different applications where these dfn packages are used. so this dfn and qfn are the no lead packages, which are available in the small form factor. so similarly, lets see another surface-mount package, which is nowadays commonly used when the high pin density is required in a compact form factor. so this package is known as the bga package, that is the ball grid array package. so if you see this bga package, then it is evolved from the pin grid array package. so this package has replaced the protruding pins of the pga package by the solder balls underneath the package. and as you can see in this image, these solder balls are arranged in the grid-like pattern. so that is why this package is known as the ball grid array. so the design of this package allows the entire bottom surface to be used for the connections rather than the perimeter. and therefore, it allows the much higher pin densities. so this package can accommodate more i-o connections in a smaller footprint compared to the perimeter-only packages like the qfp and the dipu. so in this package, the internal traces from the dies to the solder balls are shorter than the other peripheral packages. and therefore, it has the lower contact inductance and the resistance. so that is why this package is suitable for the very high frequency and the high speed applications. moreover, here as the entire bottom surface is

know, these components are commonly used in consumer electronics and many high end telecommunication and signal processing equipments. so that is all regarding the bga package. so if i just summarize,

constraint, then in such applications, the thinner version of this package is also used. so this version is known as the tqfp, that is the thin qfp package. so this version has a lesser height compared to the standard version. so similar to the soic package, as this package is also using the gull-wing kind of leads. so due to the relatively higher lead lengths, the lead inductance is also higher. and because of that, this package is not suitable for the very high frequency applications. moreover, in higher pin count qfp packages, as the leads are very near to each other, so due to that, the soldering complexity increases. so these are the few disadvantages of this package. so similar to the qfp package, there is also another package that is known as the qfn. and this qfn package is also a surface-mount package. so here, this qfn stands for the quad-flat no-lead package. so as its name suggests, this package does not have any leads, but it has flat contact pads on all four sides. so this package is available in the square as well as the rectangular form. so in this package, the semiconductor chip sits on the center and through the wire bonds, the connections are provided on the flat contact pads. and then, these contact pads are soldered on the pcb. so this package is available in the very small form factor. and if you see the pin count for this package, then it ranges from the 8-pin to the 100-pin. now the advantage of this package is that it is very compact in the low profile. moreover, on the bottom side of this package, in the center there is a metal pad. and this pad directly comes in contact with the pcb. and due to that, it helps in dissipating the heat efficiently. so that is the reason this package provides excellent heat dissipation. moreover, as this package does not have any leads, so the contact pads on this package offers the lower inductance. and due to that, this package is ideal for the high frequency and the high speed applications. moreover, being the surface mount package, this package is also suitable for the automatic assembling of the components. so these are the few advantages of this qfn package. now the only difficulty with this package is that, as the solder joints are under the package, so through the visual inspection, we cannot see the soldering. and therefore, to check whether the soldering is happening correctly or not, we need the x-ray inspection. so if you see this qfn package, then it is used in various applications like in the smartphone and wireless modules for the various components. similarly, many microcontrollers are also available in this package. likewise, many power management ics and many rf circuit components are also available in this package. so similar to the qfn package, we also have the dfn package, which is known as the dual-flat no lead package. so in case of the qfn package, we have seen that the package had the pads on all 4 sides. so similarly, this dfn package has the contact pads only on the 2 sides. so if you see the pin count or the number of contact points for this package, then it is in the range of 3 to 32. and this dfn package has an even smaller footprint compared to the qfn package. so these are the different applications where these dfn packages are used. so this dfn and qfn are the no lead packages, which are available in the small form factor. so similarly, lets see another surface-mount package, which is nowadays commonly used when the high pin density is required in a compact form factor. so this package is known as the bga package, that is the ball grid array package. so if you see this bga package, then it is evolved from the pin grid array package. so this package has replaced the protruding pins of the pga package by the solder balls underneath the package. and as you can see in this image, these solder balls are arranged in the grid-like pattern. so that is why this package is known as the ball grid array. so the design of this package allows the entire bottom surface to be used for the connections rather than the perimeter. and therefore, it allows the much higher pin densities. so this package can accommodate more i-o connections in a smaller footprint compared to the perimeter-only packages like the qfp and the dipu. so in this package, the internal traces from the dies to the solder balls are shorter than the other peripheral packages. and therefore, it has the lower contact inductance and the resistance. so that is why this package is suitable for the very high frequency and the high speed applications. moreover, here as the entire bottom surface is contributing in the heat transfer, so this package provides the better heat dissipation. now the only downside of this package is that as the solder balls are beneath the package, so the visual inspection of the soldered connection is not possible. and therefore, for the inspection, it requires the special x-ray equipment. so this bga package is typically used for the components which require the higher pin count in the small form factor. like the microprocessors, gpus, digital signal processors, as well as the high-performance microcontrollers, ram modules and the fpgas. and as we know, these components are commonly used in consumer electronics and many high end telecommunication and signal processing equipments. so that is all regarding the bga package. so if i just summarize, then we have seen the broadly two types of ic packages. that is the through-hole package and the surface mount package. and in that also, we have seen the different variants. so i hope in this video, you understood about the different ic packages, and you also learned why different ic packages exist, and in what type of application certain ic packages are used. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe

1WMSB1Nl9VA,Zener Diode Solved Problems | Line and Load Regulation in Zener Diode as Voltage Regulators,2025-07-31 07:03:04+00:00,2025,7,Thursday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will see that how to solve the problems based on the line regulation and the load regulation. So in the previous video, we understood that what is line regulation. So we have seen that this line regulation is the ability of the power supply or the voltage regulator to maintain the constant output voltage despite the change in the input voltage. So this line regulation can be defined as this ΔVout divided by ΔVin. That is the change in the output voltage due to the change in the supply voltage or the line voltage. And the unit of this line regulation is millivolt per volt. And in the percentage, it is defined as this ΔVout divided by ΔVin times 100. Similarly, we also understood about the load regulation. And we have seen that this load regulation shows the ability of the power supply or the voltage regulator to maintain the constant output voltage despite the change in the load current. So this load regulation is defined as this no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. And for the percentage, it is multiplied by 100. So now, let's take some examples based on the line regulation and the load regulation. And here, during our examples, we will take the Zener diode as the voltage regulator. So in the earlier videos also, we have solved the many examples based on the Zener diode. And during those examples, we have replaced the Zener diode by its Zener voltage. So so far, we have assumed that the Zener current of the Zener diode is zero. But actually if you see, then the Zener diode will also have some Zener resistance. Because if you see the characteristics of the Zener diode, then this is how it will look like. So in the reverse bias, up to the Zener voltage, there is no current flowing through the Zener diode. And once the reverse voltage crosses the Zener voltage, and as soon as it goes above the Zener knee current or this IZK, then this Zener diode starts conducting. And then after, for the ideal Zener diode, the voltage across the Zener diode should remain constant. But actually if you see, then with the increase in the Zener current, this Zener voltage also slightly increases. So this increase in the voltage defines the series resistance along with the Zener voltage. So this resistance is known as the Zener resistance, and it is defined as the Rz. That means beyond this IZK, when the current starts flowing through the Zener diode, then with the increase in the Zener current, the voltage of the Zener diode will also slightly increase. Then the voltage at this IZK is defined as the Vz0. So many times in the equation, the Zener knee current is given as the zero. So in that case, this Vz0 is defined as the zero current Zener voltage. But in general, this Vz0 is the voltage of the Zener diode at the IZK. So with this Zener resistance, if we see any circuit of the Zener diode as a voltage regulator, then equivalently, this Zener diode can be replaced by this Vz0 in series with this Rz. So due to the series resistance of the Zener diode, when the source voltage changes, then due to that, the Zener current will also change. And hence, the voltage across the Zener diode will also change. Similarly, with the fixed value of the source voltage, if the load current changes, then due to that, the current through the Zener diode will also change. And hence, due to that, the voltage across the Zener diode will also change. So we can say that, due to the series resistance of the Zener diode, when the source voltage changes, or when the load current changes, then due to that, the output of the Zener diode will also change. And due to that, the output across the Zener diode will not remain constant. So due to that, when we use the Zener diode as the voltage regulator, then we will get the finite value of the load regulation and the line regulation. So considering the series resistance of the Zener diode, let's see a few examples based on the line regulation and the load regulation. So here, in the first example, the 6.8V Zener diode is used in the circuit. So here, for the Zener diode, we have been given that its voltage Vz is equal to 6.8V when the current that is flowing through the Zener diode is equal to 5 mA. And here, we have also been given the series resistance of the Zener diode. So here, we have been given that the nominal supply voltage for the given circuit is equal to 10V. But due to the fluctuations, it can vary between the plus minus 1V. So here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the line voltage in mV per V. And similarly, we have been also asked to find the load regulation in mV per mA when the load current is equal to 1 mA. So let's find that. So here, first of all, we have been given that the Zener voltage Vz is equal to 6.8V when the current through the Zener diode is equal to 5 mA. And here, the value of the Rz is equal to 20Ω. So it means that this voltage across the Zener diode is equal to 6.8V when the current through the Zener diode is equal to 5 mA. So here, we can say that this voltage Vz is equal to Vz0, that is, this voltage, plus Iz times Rz. So here, this Vz is equal to 6.8V when Iz is equal to 5 mA. So we can say that this Vz0 plus 5 mA times 20Ω is equal to 6.8V. And here, this 5 mA times 20Ω is equal to 0.1V. So from this we can say that this Vz0 is equal to 6.8V minus 0.1V. That means the value of the Vz0 is equal to 6.7V. So with the Vz0, if we see the equivalent circuit, then this is how it will look like. So for the given circuit, now let's find the value of the line regulation and the load regulation. And first of all, let's find the load regulation. So here, to find the load regulation, first let's find the no load voltage. That means at that time, the current through the load is equal to 0 mA. And here, we will find this load regulation at the nominal voltage. So in this condition, let's say this no load voltage is equal to V01. And this V01 can be given as this Vz0 plus Iz times Rz. So here, we already know the value of the Vz0 as well as the Rz. So the only thing that we need to find is the Iz. So here, this Iz can be given as this 10V minus 6.7V divided by this 20Ω plus 0.5KΩ. That is equal to 500Ω. So that is equal to 3.3V divided by 520Ω. And that is equal to 6.346 mA. So now, let's put the value of the Iz in the above expression. So we can say that this V01 is equal to 6.7V plus 20Ω times 6.346 mA. And that is equal to 6.826V. So in this way, we found the value of the V01. So similarly, let's find the output voltage when the current through the load resistor is equal to 1 mA. So whenever this load current is flowing through the load resistor at that time, this Zener current Iz can be given as this Is minus Il. Where this current is the Is, while this current is the load current. And the remaining current will be the Zener current. So here, the value of the load current is equal to 1 mA. So here, to find the Zener current, first we need to find the value of the Is. So that can be given as this 10V minus Vz, that is this entire voltage divided by 500Ω. And that minus 1 mA. So here, the value of the Vz is equal to 6.7V plus 20 times Iz, that is the drop across this 20Ω resistor. So this entire term corresponds to Zener voltage. And that will get divided by 500. That means we will have this Iz is equal to this term minus 1 mA. So if we further simplify it, then we can write it as this 500 times Iz that is equal to 10 minus 6.7 minus 20 times Iz minus 0.5V. Because when this 500Ω gets multiplied by the 1 mA, then we will get the 0.5V. So if we further simplify it, then we will have this 520 times Iz that is equal to 2.8V. Or we can say that this Iz is equal to 2.8V divided by 520Ω. And that is equal to 5.384 mA. So from this we can say that this output voltage Vo2 is equal to 6.7V plus Iz that is 5.384 times 20. And that is equal to 6.807V. So in this way, we got the value of Vo1 and Vo2. So we know that this load regulation can be given as this ΔVout divided by ΔIo. So here the change in the output voltage is equal to 6.826V minus 6.807V. And here the change in the output current is equal to 1 mA. So we can say that this load regulation is approximately equal to 19 mV per mA. So from this we can say that for the given circuit, the load regulation is equal to 19 mV per mA. So similarly, let's find the line regulation. So here the line regulation can be given as the change in the output voltage to the change in the input voltage. So here the supply voltage or the input voltage is changing by the plus minus 1V. So due to that, let's find the change in the output voltage. So here we will find this line regulation at the no load. So in the no load condition, in general, here the output voltage Vo can be given as this Vz0 that is this voltage plus Iz times Rz. And here this Iz is equal to this Vs minus Vz0 divided by this Rz plus R where this R is equal to 0.5 kΩ. So in general, we can say that this output voltage is equal to Vz0 plus Iz times Rz. So here, now if the supply voltage Vs changes by the delta Vs, then due to that, let's say the output voltage is changing by the delta Vo. So here, this Vo plus delta Vo can be given as Vz0 plus Vs plus delta Vs that is the change in the supply voltage minus Vz0 that is this voltage divided by R plus Rz times Rz. So let's say, this is the equation no.1 and this is the equation no.2. So here, due to the change in the supply voltage, if we just want to find the delta change in the output voltage or this delta Vo, then we can find that by subtracting these two equations. So if we subtract the equation no.1 from the two, then we will get the delta Vo. So in that case, this will get cancelled out. And similarly, this Vs will also get cancelled out. And effectively, we will have this delta Vs times this Rz divided by R plus Rz. Or we can say that this delta Vo is equal to delta Vs times this 20Ω divided by 520Ω. So here, we have been given that this delta Vs or the supply voltage is changing by plus minus 1V. That means due to that, here the change in the output voltage is equal to plus minus times this 20 divided by 520. And that is equal to plus minus 38.46 mV. That means whenever the supply voltage changes by plus minus 1V, then the output voltage will change by plus minus 38.46 mV. Or we can say that the line regulation is equal to plus minus 38.46 mV per V. So in this way, for the given circuit, we also got the value of the line regulation. So now, let's move to the next example. So in this equation, we have been given the Zener diode based voltage regulator, and it is used to power the car radio at 9V. So here, this voltage regulator is powered using the automobile battery. And we have been given that the voltage of this battery may vary from 13.6V to 11V. And here, the current through the radio is varying from 0 mA to 100 mA. That means whenever the radio is in the off condition, then it is drawing the 0 mA. And whenever it is operated at the full volume, then it is drawing the 100 mA. That means here, the full load is equal to 100 mA, while the no load condition is equal to 0 mA. So here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the line regulation as well as the load regulation in the percentage, and the source voltage is equal to 13.6V. And here, we have also been given the value of the Zener resistance. That is equal to 2 Ohm. So let's find that. So here, in the circuit, we have been given the value of the Vz0. So with considering the Zener resistance, this is how the equivalent circuit will look like. So here, first of all, let's find the value of the load regulation. So as you know, the load regulation is given as the no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. So to find that, first of all, let's find the no load voltage. That means whenever the current that is drawn by the radio is equal to 0 mA, or effectively when it is not connected in the circuit. So here, we will consider the value of the battery as 13.6V. So at this battery voltage, this output voltage across the Zener diode can be given as this 9V plus Iz times 2 Ohm. So here, first of all, let's find the value of the Iz. So here, this Iz is equal to 13.6V minus 9V divided by this 18 Ohm plus 2 Ohm. That is this current. And if we calculate the value, then it will come out as 0.23A. So from this we can say that here the no load voltage is equal to 9V plus 2 times 0.23A. That is equal to 9.46V. So in this way, we got the no load voltage for the T1 circuit. That is equal to 9.46V. So similarly, let's find the value of the full load voltage. So here, when the radio is connected, and it is drawing the full load current, that is the 100 mA current, at that time, the value of the Zener current will also change. So let's say at that time, the value of the Zener current is equal to Iz2. So this current Iz2 will be equal to Is minus Il, where Is is this current, while Il is equal to 100 mA. So we can say that this Iz2 is equal to Is minus 0.1A. And here, this current Is is equal to 13.6V minus Vz divided by 18 Ohm. So here, this Vz is equal to 9V plus 2 times Iz. So effectively, we can say that this current Is is equal to 13.6 minus 9 plus 2 times Iz or Iz2 divided by 18 Ohm. And of course, it will also have this 0.1A. So we can say that this 18 times Iz2 that is equal to 13.6 minus 9 minus 2 times Iz2 minus 1.8V or we can say that this 20 times Iz2 is equal to 2.8V. That means here, the value of Iz2 is equal to 0.14A. That means here, this full load voltage is equal to 9V plus 2 times Iz2. And that is equal to 9V plus 2 times 0.14A. That means the full load voltage is equal to 9.28V. So in this way, the value of the full load voltage is equal to 9.28V, while the no load voltage is equal to 9.46V. So from this, we can say that the load regulation is equal to no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. So that is equal to 9.46 minus 9.28 divided by 9.28. And if we see the percentage wise, then that is equal to 1.93%. So in this way, for the given circuit, the value of the load regulation is equal to 1.93% when the supply voltage is equal to 13.6V. So similarly, let's find the line regulation. So we know that the percentage of line regulation can be given as delta Vout divided by delta Vin times 100. So here, the input voltage is changing between the 13.6V to the 11V. So for that, let's see the change in the output voltage. And here, to find that change, here we will consider the no load condition. So whenever the supply voltage is equal to 11V, at that time, let's say the output voltage is equal to Vo1. So here, this Vo1 is equal to 9V plus 2 times Iz1. And here, this Iz1 can be given as this 11V minus 9V divided by 2Ω plus 18Ω. That is this current. So we can say that here this Vo1 is equal to 9V plus 2 times 2 divided by 20Ω. And that is equal to 9.2V. So in this way, we got the value of Vo1. So similarly, let's find the value of Vo2 when the supply voltage is equal to 13.6V. And earlier, at the no load condition, we have already found the value of this Vo2. So we have seen that this Vo2 is equal to 9V plus 2 times Iz2. And that is equal to 9V plus 2 times this 13.6 minus 9 divided by 2 plus 18Ω. And we have seen that, that is equal to 9.46V. So in this way, when the supply voltage is changing from 11V to 13.6V, at that time, the change in the output voltage is from 9.2V to 9.46V. So we can say that here the line regulation is equal to 9.46V minus 9.2V divided by 13.6V minus 11V. So that is equal to 0.26 divided by 2.6 times 100. And that is equal to 10%. So we can say that for the given circuit, the line regulation is equal to 10%. So as you can see, due to this inner resistance, when the supply voltage changes, then there is a significant change in the output voltage. So to minimize that, the value of this inner resistance should be as small as possible. Alright, so now let's move to the next example. So in this question, we have been given that the reference voltage for the constant voltage source is established using the voltage Vs. This resistor R1 as well as this Zener diode D1. So here, we have been also given the value of the Zener resistance. And we have been also given that the zero current value of the Zener diode is equal to 5.6V. So basically, here this Vz0 is equal to 5.6V. So this constant reference voltage is given to this op-amp circuit. And for this entire circuit, we have been asked to find the value of the line regulation. And here, we have been given that the given op-amp is the ideal op-amp. So considering this, let's find the value of the line regulation. So here, if we consider the Zener resistance, and the value of the Vz0, then equivalently, this is how the circuit will look like. So for this circuit, let's find the line regulation. So here if you observe, then here, we have not given the value of the source voltage. But here, we will assume that the source voltage is changing by the plus-minus ΔVs. So with the change in the source voltage, let's find the line regulation. So we know that in general, the line regulation or the source regulation can be given as the change in the output voltage due to the change in the input voltage. So here, first of all, let's find the output voltage when the supply voltage is equal to Vs. And let's say, that output voltage is equal to Vo1. So here, let's say, the voltage across this Zener diode is equal to Vz. And the same voltage will appear over here. So we can say that, here this V plus is equal to Vz. Now if you observe this op-amp circuit, then here, the op-amp is configured in the non-inverting configuration. And we know that for the non-inverting configuration of the op-amp, its output voltage can be given as 1 plus this Rf divided by R1 times input voltage. So here for this op-amp, this feedback resistance is equal to 10 kΩ. And similarly, this R1 is also equal to 10 kΩ. And here, the input voltage is equal to Vz. So we can say that, here this Vo1 is equal to 2Vz. So here, this voltage Vz is equal to this Vz0 plus Iz times Rz. So that is equal to 5.6V plus 10Ω times Iz. And here, this Iz is equal to Vs minus this 5.6V divided by 4.4 kΩ that is 4400 plus 10Ω. Or we can say that, that is equal to 5.6 plus 10 divided by 4410 times Vs minus 5.6. Or that is equal to 5.6 plus Vs minus 5.6 divided by 4410. So if we see the output voltage Vo, then that is equal to 2 times Vz. That means simply this equation will get multiplied by 2. That means we will have this 11.2 plus 2 divided by 441 times Vs minus 5.6. So that is the output voltage. And the supply voltage is equal to Vs. Now whenever the supply voltage gets changed by the ΔVs, then in this equation, the only thing that will change is this Vs. That means whenever the supply voltage becomes Vs plus ΔVs, at that time, let's say the output becomes Vo1 plus ΔVo1. And that is equal to 11.2 plus 2 divided by 441 times this Vs plus ΔVs minus 5.6. So this is the value of the output voltage when the supply voltage changes by the ΔVs. So if we want to find the actual change in the output voltage or this ΔVo1, then we need to subtract these two equations. And if we subtract these two equations, then the only term that will remain is this ΔVs. So we can say that this ΔVo1 is equal to 2 divided by 441 times ΔVs. That means due to the change in the supply voltage, the change in the output voltage can be given by this expression. Or we can say that this ΔVo1 divided by ΔVs is equal to 2 divided by 441. And for the percentage, we will multiply by the 100. So if we calculate the value, then it will come out as 0.453%. So we can say that for the given circuit, the value of the line regulation is equal to 0.453%. So similarly, now let's see the last example. So in this example also, we have been given the voltage regulator. But here, the Zener diode is the ideal diode. But in this circuit, the op-amp is not ideal. And here we have been given that the open loop voltage gain of the op-amp is equal to 1000. So in the equation, we have been given that the no load current for the given circuit is equal to 1 mA, while the full load current is equal to 100 mA. So here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the load regulation. So let's find that. So here, since the Zener diode is ideal, so the voltage at this node is same as the 6.3 V. That means here, this V plus is equal to 6.3 V. And here, let's say the voltage at this node is equal to V1. And similarly, let's say the voltage over here is equal to Vo'. So considering all these things, now let's find the load regulation. So we know that the load regulation can be given by this expression. That means here, we need to find the no load voltage as well as the full load voltage. And then, using this expression, we can find the % load regulation for the given circuit. So first of all, let's find the expression of the output voltage in terms of the load current. And for that, first of all, let's apply the KCL at this node. So applying the KCL at this V1 node, we can write this V1 divided by 10 kΩ, that is this current plus V1 minus Vo' divided by 10 kΩ, that is this current is equal to zero. That means the summation of all the outgoing currents is equal to zero. So here, this 10 kΩ will get cancelled out, and we will have this 2V1 minus Vo' is equal to zero. Or we can say that this Vo' is equal to 2V1. So here, we will use this expression later on. So similarly, now let's apply the KCL at this output node. So applying the KCL at output node, we can write this Vo' divided by RL, that is this current plus Vo' minus V1 divided by 10 kΩ, that is this current plus Vo' minus Vo' dash divided by 0.5 kΩ, that is this current is equal to zero. So here, this Vo' divided by RL is nothing but the I0, that is the output current. And here, this Vo' dash is nothing but the open loop gain of the op-amp times Vo' minus V-. So that is equal to 1000 times this Vo' that is 6.3V minus V1. So further, in this expression, let's put the value of the V1 as well as the Vo' dash. So here, this Vo' is nothing but the Vo' by 2. So we can write it as, this I0 plus this Vo' minus Vo' divided by 2 divided by 10 kΩ plus Vo' divided by 0.5 kΩ minus Vo' dash divided by 0.5 kΩ and that is equal to zero. So further, we can write it as this Vo' divided by 20 kΩ, that is this term plus Vo' divided by 0.5 kΩ minus 1000 times 6.3 minus V1 divided by 0.5 kΩ is equal to minus I0. So further, if we simplify it, then we can write it as this Vo' divided by 20 kΩ plus Vo' divided by 0.5 kΩ minus 6.300 divided by 0.5 kΩ plus 1000 times V1, that is 1000 times Vo' divided by 2 times 0.5 kΩ that is equal to minus I0. So further, if we simplify it, then we can write it as this 0.05 times Vo' plus 2 Vo' plus 1000 times Vo' minus 12600 is equal to minus I0. And of course, here these entire terms will get multiplied by 10-3 because in the denominator we have 20 kΩ. So that is equal to 1002.05 times Vo' times 10-3 that is equal to 12600 mA minus I0. So in this way, we got the relationship between the output voltage and the output current. So whenever the output current is equal to 1 mA at that time, let's say this Vo' is equal to Vo1. So that is equal to 12600 mA minus 1 mA divided by this 1002.05. And of course, it will get multiplied by 10-3 and that is the value of Vo1. So if you calculate, then that will come out as 12.573 V. And similarly, when the output current or the load current is equal to 100 mA at that time, let's say the output is equal to Vo2. So that will be equal to 12600 mA minus 100 mA divided by this 1002.05. And of course, it will also have this 10-3. So that will be equal to 12.47 V. So in this way, we got the change in the output voltage when the load current is changing from 1 mA to 100 mA. And we know that this load regulation can be given by this expression. So here, this voltage is the no-load voltage, while this voltage is the full-load voltage. So we can say that the load regulation is equal to 12.573 V minus 12.47 V divided by 12.47 V. And of course, it will also get multiplied by the 100. So in the percentage, if we see the load regulation, then that is equal to 0.790%. So in this way, for the given circuit, we found the value of the load regulation. That is equal to 0.790%. So in this way, we can solve the examples on the line regulation and the load regulation based on the Zener diode-based voltage regulators. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",zener diode solved problems line and load regulation in zener diode as voltage regulators,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will see that how to solve the problems based on the line regulation and the load regulation. so in the previous video, we understood that what is line regulation. so we have seen that this line regulation is the ability of the power supply or the voltage regulator to maintain the constant output voltage despite the change in the input voltage. so this line regulation can be defined as this δvout divided by δvin. that is the change in the output voltage due to the change in the supply voltage or the line voltage. and the unit of this line regulation is millivolt per volt. and in the percentage, it is defined as this δvout divided by δvin times 100. similarly, we also understood about the load regulation. and we have seen that this load regulation shows the ability of the power supply or the voltage regulator to maintain the constant output voltage despite the change in the load current. so this load regulation is defined as this no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. and for the percentage, it is multiplied by 100. so now, lets take some examples based on the line regulation and the load regulation. and here, during our examples, we will take the zener diode as the voltage regulator. so in the earlier videos also, we have solved the many examples based on the zener diode. and during those examples, we have replaced the zener diode by its zener voltage. so so far, we have assumed that the zener current of the zener diode is zero. but actually if you see, then the zener diode will also have some zener resistance. because if you see the characteristics of the zener diode, then this is how it will look like. so in the reverse bias, up to the zener voltage, there is no current flowing through the zener diode. and once the reverse voltage crosses the zener voltage, and as soon as it goes above the zener knee current or this izk, then this zener diode starts conducting. and then after, for the ideal zener diode, the voltage across the zener diode should remain constant. but actually if you see, then with the increase in the zener current, this zener voltage also slightly increases. so this increase in the voltage defines the series resistance along with the zener voltage. so this resistance is known as the zener resistance, and it is defined as the rz. that means beyond this izk, when the current starts flowing through the zener diode, then with the increase in the zener current, the voltage of the zener diode will also slightly increase. then the voltage at this izk is defined as the vz0. so many times in the equation, the zener knee current is given as the zero. so in that case, this vz0 is defined as the zero current zener voltage. but in general, this vz0 is the voltage of the zener diode at the izk. so with this zener resistance, if we see any circuit of the zener diode as a voltage regulator, then equivalently, this zener diode can be replaced by this vz0 in series with this rz. so due to the series resistance of the zener diode, when the source voltage changes, then due to that, the zener current will also change. and hence, the voltage across the zener diode will also change. similarly, with the fixed value of the source voltage, if the load current changes, then due to that, the current through the zener diode will also change. and hence, due to that, the voltage across the zener diode will also change. so we can say that, due to the series resistance of the zener diode, when the source voltage changes, or when the load current changes, then due to that, the output of the zener diode will also change. and due to that, the output across the zener diode will not remain constant. so due to that, when we use the zener diode as the voltage regulator, then we will get the finite value of the load regulation and the line regulation. so considering the series resistance of the zener diode, lets see a few examples based on the line regulation and the load regulation. so here, in the first example, the 6.8v zener diode is used in the circuit. so here, for the zener diode, we have been given that its voltage vz is equal to 6.8v when the current that is flowing through the zener diode is equal to 5 ma. and here, we have also been given the series resistance of the zener diode. so here, we have been given that the nominal supply voltage for the given circuit is equal to 10v. but due to the fluctuations, it can vary between the plus minus 1v. so here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the line voltage in mv per v. and similarly, we have been also asked to find the load regulation in mv per ma when the load current is equal to 1 ma. so lets find that. so here, first of all, we have been given that the zener voltage vz is equal to 6.8v when the current through the zener diode is equal to 5 ma. and here, the value of the rz is equal to 20ω. so it means that this voltage across the zener diode is equal to 6.8v when the current through the zener diode is equal to 5 ma. so here, we can say that this voltage vz is equal to vz0, that is, this voltage, plus iz times rz. so here, this vz is equal to 6.8v when iz is equal to 5 ma. so we can say that this vz0 plus 5 ma times 20ω is equal to 6.8v. and here, this 5 ma times 20ω is equal to 0.1v. so from this we can say that this vz0 is equal to 6.8v minus 0.1v. that means the value of the vz0 is equal to 6.7v. so with the vz0, if we see the equivalent circuit, then this is how it will look like. so for the given circuit, now lets find the value of the line regulation and the load regulation. and first of all, lets find the load regulation. so here, to find the load regulation, first lets find the no load voltage. that means at that time, the current through the load is equal to 0 ma. and here, we will find this load regulation at the nominal voltage. so in this condition, lets say this no load voltage is equal to v01. and this v01 can be given as this vz0 plus iz times rz. so here, we already know the value of the vz0 as well as the rz. so the only thing that we need to find is the iz. so here, this iz can be given as this 10v minus 6.7v divided by this 20ω plus 0.5kω. that is equal to 500ω. so that is equal to 3.3v divided by 520ω. and that is equal to 6.346 ma. so now, lets put the value of the iz in the above expression. so we can say that this v01 is equal to 6.7v plus 20ω times 6.346 ma. and that is equal to 6.826v. so in this way, we found the value of the v01. so similarly, lets find the output voltage when the current through the load resistor is equal to 1 ma. so whenever this load current is flowing through the load resistor at that time, this zener current iz can be given as this is minus il. where this current is the is, while this current is the load current. and the remaining current will be the zener current. so here, the value of the load current is equal to 1 ma. so here, to find the zener current, first we need to find the value of the is. so that can be given as this 10v minus vz, that is this entire voltage divided by 500ω. and that minus 1 ma. so here, the value of the vz is equal to 6.7v plus 20 times iz, that is the drop across this 20ω resistor. so this entire term corresponds to zener voltage. and that will get divided by 500. that means we will have this iz is equal to this term minus 1 ma. so if we further simplify it, then we can write it as this 500 times iz that is equal to 10 minus 6.7 minus 20 times iz minus 0.5v. because when this 500ω gets multiplied by the 1 ma, then we will get the 0.5v. so if we further simplify it, then we will have this 520 times iz that is equal to 2.8v. or we can say that this iz is equal to 2.8v divided by 520ω. and that is equal to 5.384 ma. so from this we can say that this output voltage vo2 is equal to 6.7v plus iz that is 5.384 times 20. and that is equal to 6.807v. so in this way, we got the value of vo1 and vo2. so we know that this load regulation can be given as this δvout divided by δio. so here the change in the output voltage is equal to 6.826v minus 6.807v. and here the change in the output current is equal to 1 ma. so we can say that this load regulation is approximately equal to 19 mv per ma. so from this we can say that for the given circuit, the load regulation is equal to 19 mv per ma. so similarly, lets find the line regulation. so here the line regulation can be given as the change in the output voltage to the change in the input voltage. so here the supply voltage or the input voltage is changing by the plus minus 1v. so due to that, lets find the change in the output voltage. so here we will find this line regulation at the no load. so in the no load condition, in general, here the output voltage vo can be given as this vz0 that is this voltage plus iz times rz. and here this iz is equal to this vs minus vz0 divided by this rz plus r where this r is equal to 0.5 kω. so in general, we can say that this output voltage is equal to vz0 plus iz times rz. so here, now if the supply voltage vs changes by the delta vs, then due to that, lets say the output voltage is changing by the delta vo. so here, this vo plus delta vo can be given as vz0 plus vs plus delta vs that is the change in the supply voltage minus vz0 that is this voltage divided by r plus rz times rz. so lets say, this is the equation no.1 and this is the equation no.2. so here, due to the change in the supply voltage, if we just want to find the delta change in the output voltage or this delta vo, then we can find that by subtracting these two equations. so if we subtract the equation no.1 from the two, then we will get the delta vo. so in that case, this will get cancelled out. and similarly, this vs will also get cancelled out. and effectively, we will have this delta vs times this rz divided by r plus rz. or we can say that this delta vo is equal to delta vs times this 20ω divided by 520ω. so here, we have been given that this delta vs or the supply voltage is changing by plus minus 1v. that means due to that, here the change in the output voltage is equal to plus minus times this 20 divided by 520. and that is equal to plus minus 38.46 mv. that means whenever the supply voltage changes by plus minus 1v, then the output voltage will change by plus minus 38.46 mv. or we can say that the line regulation is equal to plus minus 38.46 mv per v. so in this way, for the given circuit, we also got the value of the line regulation. so now, lets move to the next example. so in this equation, we have been given the zener diode based voltage regulator, and it is used to power the car radio at 9v. so here, this voltage regulator is powered using the automobile battery. and we have been given that the voltage of this battery may vary from 13.6v to 11v. and here, the current through the radio is varying from 0 ma to 100 ma. that means whenever the radio is in the off condition, then it is drawing the 0 ma. and whenever it is operated at the full volume, then it is drawing the 100 ma. that means here, the full load is equal to 100 ma, while the no load condition is equal to 0 ma. so here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the line regulation as well as the load regulation in the percentage, and the source voltage is equal to 13.6v. and here, we have also been given the value of the zener resistance. that is equal to 2 ohm. so lets find that. so here, in the circuit, we have been given the value of the vz0. so with considering the zener resistance, this is how the equivalent circuit will look like. so here, first of all, lets find the value of the load regulation. so as you know, the load regulation is given as the no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. so to find that, first of all, lets find the no load voltage. that means whenever the current that is drawn by the radio is equal to 0 ma, or effectively when it is not connected in the circuit. so here, we will consider the value of the battery as 13.6v. so at this battery voltage, this output voltage across the zener diode can be given as this 9v plus iz times 2 ohm. so here, first of all, lets find the value of the iz. so here, this iz is equal to 13.6v minus 9v divided by this 18 ohm plus 2 ohm. that is this current. and if we calculate the value, then it will come out as 0.23a. so from this we can say that here the no load voltage is equal to 9v plus 2 times 0.23a. that is equal to 9.46v. so in this way, we got the no load voltage for the t1 circuit. that is equal to 9.46v. so similarly, lets find the value of the full load voltage. so here, when the radio is connected, and it is drawing the full load current, that is the 100 ma current, at that time, the value of the zener current will also change. so lets say at that time, the value of the zener current is equal to iz2. so this current iz2 will be equal to is minus il, where is is this current, while il is equal to 100 ma. so we can say that this iz2 is equal to is minus 0.1a. and here, this current is is equal to 13.6v minus vz divided by 18 ohm. so here, this vz is equal to 9v plus 2 times iz. so effectively, we can say that this current is is equal to 13.6 minus 9 plus 2 times iz or iz2 divided by 18 ohm. and of course, it will also have this 0.1a. so we can say that this 18 times iz2 that is equal to 13.6 minus 9 minus 2 times iz2 minus 1.8v or we can say that this 20 times iz2 is equal to 2.8v. that means here, the value of iz2 is equal to 0.14a. that means here, this full load voltage is equal to 9v plus 2 times iz2. and that is equal to 9v plus 2 times 0.14a. that means the full load voltage is equal to 9.28v. so in this way, the value of the full load voltage is equal to 9.28v, while the no load voltage is equal to 9.46v. so from this, we can say that the load regulation is equal to no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. so that is equal to 9.46 minus 9.28 divided by 9.28. and if we see the percentage wise, then that is equal to 1.93. so in this way, for the given circuit, the value of the load regulation is equal to 1.93 when the supply voltage is equal to 13.6v. so similarly, lets find the line regulation. so we know that the percentage of line regulation can be given as delta vout divided by delta vin times 100. so here, the input voltage is changing between the 13.6v to the 11v. so for that, lets see the change in the output voltage. and here, to find that change, here we will consider the no load condition. so whenever the supply voltage is equal to 11v, at that time, lets say the output voltage is equal to vo1. so here, this vo1 is equal to 9v plus 2 times iz1. and here, this iz1 can be given as this 11v minus 9v divided by 2ω plus 18ω. that is this current. so we can say that here this vo1 is equal to 9v plus 2 times 2 divided by 20ω. and that is equal to 9.2v. so in this way, we got the value of vo1. so similarly, lets find the value of vo2 when the supply voltage is equal to 13.6v. and earlier, at the no load condition, we have already found the value of this vo2. so we have seen that this vo2 is equal to 9v plus 2 times iz2. and that is equal to 9v plus 2 times this 13.6 minus 9 divided by 2 plus 18ω. and we have seen that, that is equal to 9.46v. so in this way, when the supply voltage is changing from 11v to 13.6v, at that time, the change in the output voltage is from 9.2v to 9.46v. so we can say that here the line regulation is equal to 9.46v minus 9.2v divided by 13.6v minus 11v. so that is equal to 0.26 divided by 2.6 times 100. and that is equal to 10. so we can say that for the given circuit, the line regulation is equal to 10. so as you can see, due to this inner resistance, when the supply voltage changes, then there is a significant change in the output voltage. so to minimize that, the value of this inner resistance should be as small as possible. alright, so now lets move to the next example. so in this question, we have been given that the reference voltage for the constant voltage source is established using the voltage vs. this resistor r1 as well as this zener diode d1. so here, we have been also given the value of the zener resistance. and we have been also given that the zero current value of the zener diode is equal to 5.6v. so basically, here this vz0 is equal to 5.6v. so this constant reference voltage is given to this op-amp circuit. and for this entire circuit, we have been asked to find the value of the line regulation. and here, we have been given that the given op-amp is the ideal op-amp. so considering this, lets find the value of the line regulation. so here, if we consider the zener resistance, and the value of the vz0, then equivalently, this is how the circuit will look like. so for this circuit, lets find the line regulation. so here if you observe, then here, we have not given the value of the source voltage. but here, we will assume that the source voltage is changing by the plus-minus δvs. so with the change in the source voltage, lets find the line regulation. so we know that in general, the line regulation or the source regulation can be given as the change in the output voltage due to the change in the input voltage. so here, first of all, lets find the output voltage when the supply voltage is equal to vs. and lets say, that output voltage is equal to vo1. so here, lets say, the voltage across this zener diode is equal to vz. and the same voltage will appear over here. so we can say that, here this v plus is equal to vz. now if you observe this op-amp circuit, then here, the op-amp is configured in the non-inverting configuration. and we know that for the non-inverting configuration of the op-amp, its output voltage can be given as 1 plus this rf divided by r1 times input voltage. so here for this op-amp, this feedback resistance is equal to 10 kω. and similarly, this r1 is also equal to 10 kω. and here, the input voltage is equal to vz. so we can say that, here this vo1 is equal to 2vz. so here, this voltage vz is equal to this vz0 plus iz times rz. so that is equal to 5.6v plus 10ω times iz. and here, this iz is equal to vs minus this 5.6v divided by 4.4 kω that is 4400 plus 10ω. or we can say that, that is equal to 5.6 plus 10 divided by 4410 times vs minus 5.6. or that is equal to 5.6 plus vs minus 5.6 divided by 4410. so if we see the output voltage vo, then that is equal to 2 times vz. that means simply this equation will get multiplied by 2. that means we will have this 11.2 plus 2 divided by 441 times vs minus 5.6. so that is the output voltage. and the supply voltage is equal to vs. now whenever the supply voltage gets changed by the δvs, then in this equation, the only thing that will change is this vs. that means whenever the supply voltage becomes vs plus δvs, at that time, lets say the output becomes vo1 plus δvo1. and that is equal to 11.2 plus 2 divided by 441 times this vs plus δvs minus 5.6. so this is the value of the output voltage when the supply voltage changes by the δvs. so if we want to find the actual change in the output voltage or this δvo1, then we need to subtract these two equations. and if we subtract these two equations, then the only term that will remain is this δvs. so we can say that this δvo1 is equal to 2 divided by 441 times δvs. that means due to the change in the supply voltage, the change in the output voltage can be given by this expression. or we can say that this δvo1 divided by δvs is equal to 2 divided by 441. and for the percentage, we will multiply by the 100. so if we calculate the value, then it will come out as 0.453. so we can say that for the given circuit, the value of the line regulation is equal to 0.453. so similarly, now lets see the last example. so in this example also, we have been given the voltage regulator. but here, the zener diode is the ideal diode. but in this circuit, the op-amp is not ideal. and here we have been given that the open loop voltage gain of the op-amp is equal to 1000. so in the equation, we have been given that the no load current for the given circuit is equal to 1 ma, while the full load current is equal to 100 ma. so here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the load regulation. so lets find that. so here, since the zener diode is ideal, so the voltage at this node is same as the 6.3 v. that means here, this v plus is equal to 6.3 v. and here, lets say the voltage at this node is equal to v1. and similarly, lets say the voltage over here is equal to vo. so considering all these things, now lets find the load regulation. so we know that the load regulation can be given by this expression. that means here, we need to find the no load voltage as well as the full load voltage. and then, using this expression, we can find the load regulation for the given circuit. so first of all, lets find the expression of the output voltage in terms of the load current. and for that, first of all, lets apply the kcl at this node. so applying the kcl at this v1 node, we can write this v1 divided by 10 kω, that is this current plus v1 minus vo divided by 10 kω, that is this current is equal to zero. that means the summation of all the outgoing currents is equal to zero. so here, this 10 kω will get cancelled out, and we will have this 2v1 minus vo is equal to zero. or we can say that this vo is equal to 2v1. so here, we will use this expression later on. so similarly, now lets apply the kcl at this output node. so applying the kcl at output node, we can write this vo divided by rl, that is this current plus vo minus v1 divided by 10 kω, that is this current plus vo minus vo dash divided by 0.5 kω, that is this current is equal to zero. so here, this vo divided by rl is nothing but the i0, that is the output current. and here, this vo dash is nothing but the open loop gain of the op-amp times vo minus v-. so that is equal to 1000 times this vo that is 6.3v minus v1. so further, in this expression, lets put the value of the v1 as well as the vo dash. so here, this vo is nothing but the vo by 2. so we can write it as, this i0 plus this vo minus vo divided by 2 divided by 10 kω plus vo divided by 0.5 kω minus vo dash divided by 0.5 kω and that is equal to zero. so further, we can write it as this vo divided by 20 kω, that is this term plus vo divided by 0.5 kω minus 1000 times 6.3 minus v1 divided by 0.5 kω is equal to minus i0. so further, if we simplify it, then we can write it as this vo divided by 20 kω plus vo divided by 0.5 kω minus 6.300 divided by 0.5 kω plus 1000 times v1, that is 1000 times vo divided by 2 times 0.5 kω that is equal to minus i0. so further, if we simplify it, then we can write it as this 0.05 times vo plus 2 vo plus 1000 times vo minus 12600 is equal to minus i0. and of course, here these entire terms will get multiplied by 10-3 because in the denominator we have 20 kω. so that is equal to 1002.05 times vo times 10-3 that is equal to 12600 ma minus i0. so in this way, we got the relationship between the output voltage and the output current. so whenever the output current is equal to 1 ma at that time, lets say this vo is equal to vo1. so that is equal to 12600 ma minus 1 ma divided by this 1002.05. and of course, it will get multiplied by 10-3 and that is the value of vo1. so if you calculate, then that will come out as 12.573 v. and similarly, when the output current or the load current is equal to 100 ma at that time, lets say the output is equal to vo2. so that will be equal to 12600 ma minus 100 ma divided by this 1002.05. and of course, it will also have this 10-3. so that will be equal to 12.47 v. so in this way, we got the change in the output voltage when the load current is changing from 1 ma to 100 ma. and we know that this load regulation can be given by this expression. so here, this voltage is the no-load voltage, while this voltage is the full-load voltage. so we can say that the load regulation is equal to 12.573 v minus 12.47 v divided by 12.47 v. and of course, it will also get multiplied by the 100. so in the percentage, if we see the load regulation, then that is equal to 0.790. so in this way, for the given circuit, we found the value of the load regulation. that is equal to 0.790. so in this way, we can solve the examples on the line regulation and the load regulation based on the zener diode-based voltage regulators. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.","zener diode solved problems line and load regulation in zener diode as voltage regulators hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will see that how to solve the problems based on the line regulation and the load regulation. so in the previous video, we understood that what is line regulation. so we have seen that this line regulation is the ability of the power supply or the voltage regulator to maintain the constant output voltage despite the change in the input voltage. so this line regulation can be defined as this δvout divided by δvin. that is the change in the output voltage due to the change in the supply voltage or the line voltage. and the unit of this line regulation is millivolt per volt. and in the percentage, it is defined as this δvout divided by δvin times 100. similarly, we also understood about the load regulation. and we have seen that this load regulation shows the ability of the power supply or the voltage regulator to maintain the constant output voltage despite the change in the load current. so this load regulation is defined as this no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. and for the percentage, it is multiplied by 100. so now, lets take some examples based on the line regulation and the load regulation. and here, during our examples, we will take the zener diode as the voltage regulator. so in the earlier videos also, we have solved the many examples based on the zener diode. and during those examples, we have replaced the zener diode by its zener voltage. so so far, we have assumed that the zener current of the zener diode is zero. but actually if you see, then the zener diode will also have some zener resistance. because if you see the characteristics of the zener diode, then this is how it will look like. so in the reverse bias, up to the zener voltage, there is no current flowing through the zener diode. and once the reverse voltage crosses the zener voltage, and as soon as it goes above the zener knee current or this izk, then this zener diode starts conducting. and then after, for the ideal zener diode, the voltage across the zener diode should remain constant. but actually if you see, then with the increase in the zener current, this zener voltage also slightly increases. so this increase in the voltage defines the series resistance along with the zener voltage. so this resistance is known as the zener resistance, and it is defined as the rz. that means beyond this izk, when the current starts flowing through the zener diode, then with the increase in the zener current, the voltage of the zener diode will also slightly increase. then the voltage at this izk is defined as the vz0. so many times in the equation, the zener knee current is given as the zero. so in that case, this vz0 is defined as the zero current zener voltage. but in general, this vz0 is the voltage of the zener diode at the izk. so with this zener resistance, if we see any circuit of the zener diode as a voltage regulator, then equivalently, this zener diode can be replaced by this vz0 in series with this rz. so due to the series resistance of the zener diode, when the source voltage changes, then due to that, the zener current will also change. and hence, the voltage across the zener diode will also change. similarly, with the fixed value of the source voltage, if the load current changes, then due to that, the current through the zener diode will also change. and hence, due to that, the voltage across the zener diode will also change. so we can say that, due to the series resistance of the zener diode, when the source voltage changes, or when the load current changes, then due to that, the output of the zener diode will also change. and due to that, the output across the zener diode will not remain constant. so due to that, when we use the zener diode as the voltage regulator, then we will get the finite value of the load regulation and the line regulation. so considering the series resistance of the zener diode, lets see a few examples based on the line regulation and the load regulation. so here, in the first example, the 6.8v zener diode is used in the circuit. so here, for the zener diode, we have been given that its voltage vz is equal to 6.8v when the current that is flowing through the zener diode is equal to 5 ma. and here, we have also been given the series resistance of the zener diode. so here, we have been given that the nominal supply voltage for the given circuit is equal to 10v. but due to the fluctuations, it can vary between the plus minus 1v. so here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the line voltage in mv per v. and similarly, we have been also asked to find the load regulation in mv per ma when the load current is equal to 1 ma. so lets find that. so here, first of all, we have been given that the zener voltage vz is equal to 6.8v when the current through the zener diode is equal to 5 ma. and here, the value of the rz is equal to 20ω. so it means that this voltage across the zener diode is equal to 6.8v when the current through the zener diode is equal to 5 ma. so here, we can say that this voltage vz is equal to vz0, that is, this voltage, plus iz times rz. so here, this vz is equal to 6.8v when iz is equal to 5 ma. so we can say that this vz0 plus 5 ma times 20ω is equal to 6.8v. and here, this 5 ma times 20ω is equal to 0.1v. so from this we can say that this vz0 is equal to 6.8v minus 0.1v. that means the value of the vz0 is equal to 6.7v. so with the vz0, if we see the equivalent circuit, then this is how it will look like. so for the given circuit, now lets find the value of the line regulation and the load regulation. and first of all, lets find the load regulation. so here, to find the load regulation, first lets find the no load voltage. that means at that time, the current through the load is equal to 0 ma. and here, we will find this load regulation at the nominal voltage. so in this condition, lets say this no load voltage is equal to v01. and this v01 can be given as this vz0 plus iz times rz. so here, we already know the value of the vz0 as well as the rz. so the only thing that we need to find is the iz. so here, this iz can be given as this 10v minus 6.7v divided by this 20ω plus 0.5kω. that is equal to 500ω. so that is equal to 3.3v divided by 520ω. and that is equal to 6.346 ma. so now, lets put the value of the iz in the above expression. so we can say that this v01 is equal to 6.7v plus 20ω times 6.346 ma. and that is equal to 6.826v. so in this way, we found the value of the v01. so similarly, lets find the output voltage when the current through the load resistor is equal to 1 ma. so whenever this load current is flowing through the load resistor at that time, this zener current iz can be given as this is minus il. where this current is the is, while this current is the load current. and the remaining current will be the zener current. so here, the value of the load current is equal to 1 ma. so here, to find the zener current, first we need to find the value of the is. so that can be given as this 10v minus vz, that is this entire voltage divided by 500ω. and that minus 1 ma. so here, the value of the vz is equal to 6.7v plus 20 times iz, that is the drop across this 20ω resistor. so this entire term corresponds to zener voltage. and that will get divided by 500. that means we will have this iz is equal to this term minus 1 ma. so if we further simplify it, then we can write it as this 500 times iz that is equal to 10 minus 6.7 minus 20 times iz minus 0.5v. because when this 500ω gets multiplied by the 1 ma, then we will get the 0.5v. so if we further simplify it, then we will have this 520 times iz that is equal to 2.8v. or we can say that this iz is equal to 2.8v divided by 520ω. and that is equal to 5.384 ma. so from this we can say that this output voltage vo2 is equal to 6.7v plus iz that is 5.384 times 20. and that is equal to 6.807v. so in this way, we got the value of vo1 and vo2. so we know that this load regulation can be given as this δvout divided by δio. so here the change in the output voltage is equal to 6.826v minus 6.807v. and here the change in the output current is equal to 1 ma. so we can say that this load regulation is approximately equal to 19 mv per ma. so from this we can say that for the given circuit, the load regulation is equal to 19 mv per ma. so similarly, lets find the line regulation. so here the line regulation can be given as the change in the output voltage to the change in the input voltage. so here the supply voltage or the input voltage is changing by the plus minus 1v. so due to that, lets find the change in the output voltage. so here we will find this line regulation at the no load. so in the no load condition, in general, here the output voltage vo can be given as this vz0 that is this voltage plus iz times rz. and here this iz is equal to this vs minus vz0 divided by this rz plus r where this r is equal to 0.5 kω. so in general, we can say that this output voltage is equal to vz0 plus iz times rz. so here, now if the supply voltage vs changes by the delta vs, then due to that, lets say the output voltage is changing by the delta vo. so here, this vo plus delta vo can be given as vz0 plus vs plus delta vs that is the change in the supply voltage minus vz0 that is this voltage divided by r plus rz times rz. so lets say, this is the equation no.1 and this is the equation no.2. so here, due to the change in the supply voltage, if we just want to find the delta change in the output voltage or this delta vo, then we can find that by subtracting these two equations. so if we subtract the equation no.1 from the two, then we will get the delta vo. so in that case, this will get cancelled out. and similarly, this vs will also get cancelled out. and effectively, we will have this delta vs times this rz divided by r plus rz. or we can say that this delta vo is equal to delta vs times this 20ω divided by 520ω. so here, we have been given that this delta vs or the supply voltage is changing by plus minus 1v. that means due to that, here the change in the output voltage is equal to plus minus times this 20 divided by 520. and that is equal to plus minus 38.46 mv. that means whenever the supply voltage changes by plus minus 1v, then the output voltage will change by plus minus 38.46 mv. or we can say that the line regulation is equal to plus minus 38.46 mv per v. so in this way, for the given circuit, we also got the value of the line regulation. so now, lets move to the next example. so in this equation, we have been given the zener diode based voltage regulator, and it is used to power the car radio at 9v. so here, this voltage regulator is powered using the automobile battery. and we have been given that the voltage of this battery may vary from 13.6v to 11v. and here, the current through the radio is varying from 0 ma to 100 ma. that means whenever the radio is in the off condition, then it is drawing the 0 ma. and whenever it is operated at the full volume, then it is drawing the 100 ma. that means here, the full load is equal to 100 ma, while the no load condition is equal to 0 ma. so here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the line regulation as well as the load regulation in the percentage, and the source voltage is equal to 13.6v. and here, we have also been given the value of the zener resistance. that is equal to 2 ohm. so lets find that. so here, in the circuit, we have been given the value of the vz0. so with considering the zener resistance, this is how the equivalent circuit will look like. so here, first of all, lets find the value of the load regulation. so as you know, the load regulation is given as the no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. so to find that, first of all, lets find the no load voltage. that means whenever the current that is drawn by the radio is equal to 0 ma, or effectively when it is not connected in the circuit. so here, we will consider the value of the battery as 13.6v. so at this battery voltage, this output voltage across the zener diode can be given as this 9v plus iz times 2 ohm. so here, first of all, lets find the value of the iz. so here, this iz is equal to 13.6v minus 9v divided by this 18 ohm plus 2 ohm. that is this current. and if we calculate the value, then it will come out as 0.23a. so from this we can say that here the no load voltage is equal to 9v plus 2 times 0.23a. that is equal to 9.46v. so in this way, we got the no load voltage for the t1 circuit. that is equal to 9.46v. so similarly, lets find the value of the full load voltage. so here, when the radio is connected, and it is drawing the full load current, that is the 100 ma current, at that time, the value of the zener current will also change. so lets say at that time, the value of the zener current is equal to iz2. so this current iz2 will be equal to is minus il, where is is this current, while il is equal to 100 ma. so we can say that this iz2 is equal to is minus 0.1a. and here, this current is is equal to 13.6v minus vz divided by 18 ohm. so here, this vz is equal to 9v plus 2 times iz. so effectively, we can say that this current is is equal to 13.6 minus 9 plus 2 times iz or iz2 divided by 18 ohm. and of course, it will also have this 0.1a. so we can say that this 18 times iz2 that is equal to 13.6 minus 9 minus 2 times iz2 minus 1.8v or we can say that this 20 times iz2 is equal to 2.8v. that means here, the value of iz2 is equal to 0.14a. that means here, this full load voltage is equal to 9v plus 2 times iz2. and that is equal to 9v plus 2 times 0.14a. that means the full load voltage is equal to 9.28v. so in this way, the value of the full load voltage is equal to 9.28v, while the no load voltage is equal to 9.46v. so from this, we can say that the load regulation is equal to no load voltage minus full load voltage divided by full load voltage. so that is equal to 9.46 minus 9.28 divided by 9.28. and if we see the percentage wise, then that is equal to 1.93. so in this way, for the given circuit, the value of the load regulation is equal to 1.93 when the supply voltage is equal to 13.6v. so similarly, lets find the line regulation. so we know that the percentage of line regulation can be given as delta vout divided by delta vin times 100. so here, the input voltage is changing between the 13.6v to the 11v. so for that, lets see the change in the output voltage. and here, to find that change, here we will consider the no load condition. so whenever the supply voltage is equal to 11v, at that time, lets say the output voltage is equal to vo1. so here, this vo1 is equal to 9v plus 2 times iz1. and here, this iz1 can be given as this 11v minus 9v divided by 2ω plus 18ω. that is this current. so we can say that here this vo1 is equal to 9v plus 2 times 2 divided by 20ω. and that is equal to 9.2v. so in this way, we got the value of vo1. so similarly, lets find the value of vo2 when the supply voltage is equal to 13.6v. and earlier, at the no load condition, we have already found the value of this vo2. so we have seen that this vo2 is equal to 9v plus 2 times iz2. and that is equal to 9v plus 2 times this 13.6 minus 9 divided by 2 plus 18ω. and we have seen that, that is equal to 9.46v. so in this way, when the supply voltage is changing from 11v to 13.6v, at that time, the change in the output voltage is from 9.2v to 9.46v. so we can say that here the line regulation is equal to 9.46v minus 9.2v divided by 13.6v minus 11v. so that is equal to 0.26 divided by 2.6 times 100. and that is equal to 10. so we can say that for the given circuit, the line regulation is equal to 10. so as you can see, due to this inner resistance, when the supply voltage changes, then there is a significant change in the output voltage. so to minimize that, the value of this inner resistance should be as small as possible. alright, so now lets move to the next example. so in this question, we have been given that the reference voltage for the constant voltage source is established using the voltage vs. this resistor r1 as well as this zener diode d1. so here, we have been also given the value of the zener resistance. and we have been also given that the zero current value of the zener diode is equal to 5.6v. so basically, here this vz0 is equal to 5.6v. so this constant reference voltage is given to this op-amp circuit. and for this entire circuit, we have been asked to find the value of the line regulation. and here, we have been given that the given op-amp is the ideal op-amp. so considering this, lets find the value of the line regulation. so here, if we consider the zener resistance, and the value of the vz0, then equivalently, this is how the circuit will look like. so for this circuit, lets find the line regulation. so here if you observe, then here, we have not given the value of the source voltage. but here, we will assume that the source voltage is changing by the plus-minus δvs. so with the change in the source voltage, lets find the line regulation. so we know that in general, the line regulation or the source regulation can be given as the change in the output voltage due to the change in the input voltage. so here, first of all, lets find the output voltage when the supply voltage is equal to vs. and lets say, that output voltage is equal to vo1. so here, lets say, the voltage across this zener diode is equal to vz. and the same voltage will appear over here. so we can say that, here this v plus is equal to vz. now if you observe this op-amp circuit, then here, the op-amp is configured in the non-inverting configuration. and we know that for the non-inverting configuration of the op-amp, its output voltage can be given as 1 plus this rf divided by r1 times input voltage. so here for this op-amp, this feedback resistance is equal to 10 kω. and similarly, this r1 is also equal to 10 kω. and here, the input voltage is equal to vz. so we can say that, here this vo1 is equal to 2vz. so here, this voltage vz is equal to this vz0 plus iz times rz. so that is equal to 5.6v plus 10ω times iz. and here, this iz is equal to vs minus this 5.6v divided by 4.4 kω that is 4400 plus 10ω. or we can say that, that is equal to 5.6 plus 10 divided by 4410 times vs minus 5.6. or that is equal to 5.6 plus vs minus 5.6 divided by 4410. so if we see the output voltage vo, then that is equal to 2 times vz. that means simply this equation will get multiplied by 2. that means we will have this 11.2 plus 2 divided by 441 times vs minus 5.6. so that is the output voltage. and the supply voltage is equal to vs. now whenever the supply voltage gets changed by the δvs, then in this equation, the only thing that will change is this vs. that means whenever the supply voltage becomes vs plus δvs, at that time, lets say the output becomes vo1 plus δvo1. and that is equal to 11.2 plus 2 divided by 441 times this vs plus δvs minus 5.6. so this is the value of the output voltage when the supply voltage changes by the δvs. so if we want to find the actual change in the output voltage or this δvo1, then we need to subtract these two equations. and if we subtract these two equations, then the only term that will remain is this δvs. so we can say that this δvo1 is equal to 2 divided by 441 times δvs. that means due to the change in the supply voltage, the change in the output voltage can be given by this expression. or we can say that this δvo1 divided by δvs is equal to 2 divided by 441. and for the percentage, we will multiply by the 100. so if we calculate the value, then it will come out as 0.453. so we can say that for the given circuit, the value of the line regulation is equal to 0.453. so similarly, now lets see the last example. so in this example also, we have been given the voltage regulator. but here, the zener diode is the ideal diode. but in this circuit, the op-amp is not ideal. and here we have been given that the open loop voltage gain of the op-amp is equal to 1000. so in the equation, we have been given that the no load current for the given circuit is equal to 1 ma, while the full load current is equal to 100 ma. so here, for the given circuit, we have been asked to find the load regulation. so lets find that. so here, since the zener diode is ideal, so the voltage at this node is same as the 6.3 v. that means here, this v plus is equal to 6.3 v. and here, lets say the voltage at this node is equal to v1. and similarly, lets say the voltage over here is equal to vo. so considering all these things, now lets find the load regulation. so we know that the load regulation can be given by this expression. that means here, we need to find the no load voltage as well as the full load voltage. and then, using this expression, we can find the load regulation for the given circuit. so first of all, lets find the expression of the output voltage in terms of the load current. and for that, first of all, lets apply the kcl at this node. so applying the kcl at this v1 node, we can write this v1 divided by 10 kω, that is this current plus v1 minus vo divided by 10 kω, that is this current is equal to zero. that means the summation of all the outgoing currents is equal to zero. so here, this 10 kω will get cancelled out, and we will have this 2v1 minus vo is equal to zero. or we can say that this vo is equal to 2v1. so here, we will use this expression later on. so similarly, now lets apply the kcl at this output node. so applying the kcl at output node, we can write this vo divided by rl, that is this current plus vo minus v1 divided by 10 kω, that is this current plus vo minus vo dash divided by 0.5 kω, that is this current is equal to zero. so here, this vo divided by rl is nothing but the i0, that is the output current. and here, this vo dash is nothing but the open loop gain of the op-amp times vo minus v-. so that is equal to 1000 times this vo that is 6.3v minus v1. so further, in this expression, lets put the value of the v1 as well as the vo dash. so here, this vo is nothing but the vo by 2. so we can write it as, this i0 plus this vo minus vo divided by 2 divided by 10 kω plus vo divided by 0.5 kω minus vo dash divided by 0.5 kω and that is equal to zero. so further, we can write it as this vo divided by 20 kω, that is this term plus vo divided by 0.5 kω minus 1000 times 6.3 minus v1 divided by 0.5 kω is equal to minus i0. so further, if we simplify it, then we can write it as this vo divided by 20 kω plus vo divided by 0.5 kω minus 6.300 divided by 0.5 kω plus 1000 times v1, that is 1000 times vo divided by 2 times 0.5 kω that is equal to minus i0. so further, if we simplify it, then we can write it as this 0.05 times vo plus 2 vo plus 1000 times vo minus 12600 is equal to minus i0. and of course, here these entire terms will get multiplied by 10-3 because in the denominator we have 20 kω. so that is equal to 1002.05 times vo times 10-3 that is equal to 12600 ma minus i0. so in this way, we got the relationship between the output voltage and the output current. so whenever the output current is equal to 1 ma at that time, lets say this vo is equal to vo1. so that is equal to 12600 ma minus 1 ma divided by this 1002.05. and of course, it will get multiplied by 10-3 and that is the value of vo1. so if you calculate, then that will come out as 12.573 v. and similarly, when the output current or the load current is equal to 100 ma at that time, lets say the output is equal to vo2. so that will be equal to 12600 ma minus 100 ma divided by this 1002.05. and of course, it will also have this 10-3. so that will be equal to 12.47 v. so in this way, we got the change in the output voltage when the load current is changing from 1 ma to 100 ma. and we know that this load regulation can be given by this expression. so here, this voltage is the no-load voltage, while this voltage is the full-load voltage. so we can say that the load regulation is equal to 12.573 v minus 12.47 v divided by 12.47 v. and of course, it will also get multiplied by the 100. so in the percentage, if we see the load regulation, then that is equal to 0.790. so in this way, for the given circuit, we found the value of the load regulation. that is equal to 0.790. so in this way, we can solve the examples on the line regulation and the load regulation based on the zener diode-based voltage regulators. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do

ztDimUBc2dU,4 to 20 mA Standard Explained | Advantages of 4 to 20 mA Standard,2025-06-21 07:31:28+00:00,2025,6,Saturday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the 4-20 mA standard, and we will see that why it is the preferred standard in the industrial environment. So this 4-20 mA standard is the analog signal transmission standard, which is used in the industrial automation and the process control to transmit the field information from  the sensors to the control system like the PLC. And this information is transmitted in the form of current. So let's understand why it is preferred over the other techniques of the transmission. So in the industrial environment, different types of sensors are used to measure the  various process parameters like the temperature flow and the level. Now these sensors can transmit the data from the field to the PLC either in the form  of voltage or the current. So when these sensors transmit in the form of voltage, then typically this voltage is in the range of 0 to 10 V. So to transmit this data along with the sensor, there is always a transmitter. So this transmitter reads the sensor data and converts it into the appropriate range for the transmission. Now as you know, this industrial environment is electrically noisy due to the various  machineries like the motor, variable frequency drive, and the high-power cables. So when the sensor data is transmitted in the form of voltage, then due to this  electrical noise, this voltage signal is susceptible to the EMI. So this electromagnetic interference can induce a small voltage in the signal wire,  and this small voltage can corrupt the measurement. For example, let's say the transmitter is sending the 5V signal. But due to this noise or this EMI, the receiver in the control room receives the 5.1V. And sometimes this change in this voltage can cause the problem. So in short, in this industrial environment, this voltage signal is susceptible to the noise. While if you see the current signal, then it is immune to the noise. So that is one of the advantages of transmitting the signal data in the form of current. Now another drawback of transmitting the sensor data in the form of voltage is that,  as the voltage signal propagates over the cable length, then the voltage signal gets attenuated. Because this cable has some finite resistance. And many times, this cable length varies from hundreds of meters to the several kilometers. So in that case, due to the higher resistance, there will be a voltage drop  when the signal travels from one end to the other end. So it is quite possible that the transmitter is transmitting the 5.2V, but by the time the receiver receives that signal at the other end, then the signal drops to the 5V. So that is the issue with transmitting the voltage signal over the long range. But if you see the current signal, then that is not the problem. Because the current remains same throughout the cable length. So that is another advantage of transmitting the field parameters in the form of current. That means using this 4 to 20 mA signal,  it is possible to transmit the signal over the longer distance. Now if you see the another advantage of this standard,  then this standard has the concept of Live Zero. That means here, the 4 mA represents the lowest value or the 0% of the full-scale value. For example, if the temperature sensor range is from 25°C to 100°C, then this 25°C represents the 0% of the full-scale range, while if you see the 100°C,  then that represents the 100% of the full-scale range. That means here, in this 4 to 20 mA signal, the 0% of the measurement value is the 4 mA. But instead of the 4 mA, suppose the minimum value of the measurement range is kept 0 mA, then in that case, the 0% of the measurement value corresponds to 0 mA. And in that case, suppose there is a fault in the loop, or if there is a device failure or the broken wire, then we do not know whether it is due to the fault  or due to the actual 0% of the measurement value. That means instead of the 4 to 20 mA, suppose the range is kept from 0 to 20 mA,  then in that case, the fault finding becomes difficult. But in the case of the 4 to 20 mA standard, as the minimum signal is 4 mA, so whenever the signal is equal to 4 mA, then we know that the link is live and the measurement value is indeed 0% of the full-scale range. So that is the Live Zero concept. That means the value of the 0% measurement is higher than the 0 mA. And whenever the signal level drops below the 4 mA, or if it becomes 0 mA, then we know that there is some fault in the loop, like the broken wire or the device failure. So in this way, using the 4 to 20 mA standard, it becomes easy to identify the fault condition. Now while this specific range is only kept, we will discuss it a little later. But that is another advantage of the 4 to 20 mA standard. That means because of the Live Zero, the fault finding becomes easier. So if you see this 4 to 20 mA standard, then it is the two-wire loop. That means on these two wires, the signal current is flowing between the transmitter and the receiver. Now the advantage of this method is that, using the same two wires,  it is also possible to power up the transmitter. So nowadays, the receiver themselves are capable of powering this 4 to 20 mA loop. That means they have the separate power to power up this loop. So typically, they provide the standard 24 V voltage. And of course, over the loop, there will be some finite voltage drop. But still, even after the voltage drop, the sufficient voltage will reach to the transmitter. So using this voltage, and the current that is as low as the 4 mA,  it is possible to power up the circuitry inside the transmitter. So for example, let's say, the sensor output of this flowmeter corresponds to 8 mA. That means in that case, the transmitter needs to send the 8 mA current to the receiver side. So what this transmitter will do, it will draw the 8 mA current from the power supply. And from this current itself, it will power up all the circuitry inside the transmitter. And then, the same current will return through the loop. So now on the receiver end, there will be a 250 ohm resistor. And through this resistor, this 8 mA current will pass. So due to that, there will be a voltage drop across it, and the ADC inside the receiver will read this voltage. And in this way, this 4 to 20 mA current will get converted  into the voltage at the receiver end. So the point is, in this 4 to 20 mA loop, using the same signal current, it is possible to power up the transmitter. And therefore, these transmitters are known as the loop powered device. That means they can get powered up using the loop itself. Now if the receiver does not have the capability to power up the loop,  then in that case, this is how the loop is powered. So once again, the power supply will provide the 24V supply to the loop. Then the transmitter will draw the current from the power supply based on the sensor output. Let's say, that is equal to 8 mA. So the same 8 mA current will go through the return wire. So now, the receiver senses that current and converts that current into the voltage. So as I said, inside the receiver, we have the 250 ohm resistor and the ADC. Or equivalently, this is how it can be represented. So when the current passes through this 250 ohm resistor,  then there will be a drop across it and this ADC reads that voltage drop. So as you can see, the readout mechanism in this 4 to 20 mA loop is also very simple. Now another advantage of this 4 to 20 mA standard is that, using the same 2-wire loop, it is also possible to transmit the digital signal on top of the analog current signal. That means, using the same 2 wires, it is also possible to perform the digital communication. And for that, the transmitter and the receiver should also support the communication protocol. So typically, this digital communication is carried out over the HART protocol. That means for that, the transmitter and the receiver should also be HART enabled. So as per this protocol, the digital signal is superimposed on top of the analog signal using the frequency shift keying. So as per this protocol, the logic 0 is transmitted using a 2200 Hz sine wave,  while the logic 1 is transmitted by the 1200 Hz sine wave. And of course, this frequency shift keyed signal is also a current signal. That means this 1 mA peak to peak current signal is superimposed on top of the 4 to 20 mA signal. And at the receiver, both digital and the analog signals are separated. And both of them can be treated separately. So in such a case, if we have the HART enabled device, like the handheld communicator,  then it can listen to these digital signals. And remotely, it can configure the transmitter, or it can also perform the required calibration. So that is another advantage of this 4 to 20 mA standard. That means using this, it is also possible to transmit the digital signals using the same 2-wire loop. So now, let's understand why this specific range of 4 to 20 mA is selected for the transmission. So we have already seen the concept of Live 0. So we have seen that, instead of selecting the 0 mA, if we select the 4 mA for the  minimum measured value, then the fault detection becomes very easy. But then the question is, why it is only 4 mA? Because it could have been also 2 mA or the 3 mA, right? So the reason is that, this current is also used to power up the transmitter. And earlier, we have already seen that. So initially, the 1 mA or the 2 mA current was also considered as the minimum current. But at that time, that current was not sufficient to power up the electronics of the transmitter. And that is why, the 4 mA current was selected as the minimum current. So this 4 mA current was enough to power the vast majority of the transmitters  and operate them reliably. So that is the reason for selecting the 4 mA as the minimum current. But then the question arises, why only 20 mA was selected as the upper range? So the reason is that, before the electronic instrumentation became dominant,  the industrial plants were running on the pneumatic signal. And the established standard for the pneumatic control was between 3 PSI to 15 PSI. So at that time, the 3 PSI was the Live 0. That means if the pressure drops to the 0 PSI, then the engineer or the technician  knew that there is a leak in the air-line. And similarly, the 15 PSI pressure was the 100% signal. So when the equivalent electronic standards were being developed, at that time,  the engineers wanted to create the system that is analogous to the pneumatic system. Because the technicians and the engineers at that time were already familiar with the pneumatic system. So if you see the ratio in the pneumatic system between the maximum and the minimum value, then that is the 5. So the same ratio was also maintained in the new standard. So that is why the range in this standard is from 4 to 20 mA. Now another reason for selecting the 20 mA as the maximum current is that,  this current is intrinsically safe to avoid the hazard. So by capping the maximum current at 20 mA, it is much easier and cheaper to design  the circuits that are intrinsically safe. And also for the human safety perspective also, this current is in the safe range. So that is the reason for keeping the 4 to 20 mA range for this standard. So in a summary, these are the advantages of the 4 to 20 mA standard. So I hope in this video, you understood why the 4 to 20 mA standard is preferred in  the industrial automation, and why this specific range is selected for this standard. So if you have any question or suggestion,  then do let me know here in the comment section below.

channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the 4-20 ma standard, and we will see that why it is the preferred standard in the industrial environment. so this 4-20 ma standard is the analog signal transmission standard, which is used in the industrial automation and the process control to transmit the field information from the sensors to the control system like the plc. and this information is transmitted in the form of current. so lets understand why it is preferred over the other techniques of the transmission. so in the industrial environment, different types of sensors are used to measure the various process parameters like the temperature flow and the level. now these sensors can transmit the data from the field to the plc either in the form of voltage or the current. so when these sensors transmit in the form of voltage, then typically this voltage is in the range of 0 to 10 v. so to transmit this data along with the sensor, there is always a transmitter. so this transmitter reads the sensor data and converts it into the appropriate range for the transmission. now as you know, this industrial environment is electrically noisy due to the various machineries like the motor, variable frequency drive, and the high-power cables. so when the sensor data is transmitted in the form of voltage, then due to this electrical noise, this voltage signal is susceptible to the emi. so this electromagnetic interference can induce a small voltage in the signal wire, and this small voltage can corrupt the measurement. for example, lets say the transmitter is sending the 5v signal. but due to this noise or this emi, the receiver in the control room receives the 5.1v. and sometimes this change in this voltage can cause the problem. so in short, in this industrial environment, this voltage signal is susceptible to the noise. while if you see the current signal, then it is immune to the noise. so that is one of the advantages of transmitting the signal data in the form of current. now another drawback of transmitting the sensor data in the form of voltage is that, as the voltage signal propagates over the cable length, then the voltage signal gets attenuated. because this cable has some finite resistance. and many times, this cable length varies from hundreds of meters to the several kilometers. so in that case, due to the higher resistance, there will be a voltage drop when the signal travels from one end to the other end. so it is quite possible that the transmitter is transmitting the 5.2v, but by the time the receiver receives that signal at the other end, then the signal drops to the 5v. so that is the issue with transmitting the voltage signal over the long range. but if you see the current signal, then that is not the problem. because the current remains same throughout the cable length. so that is another advantage of transmitting the field parameters in the form of current. that means using this 4 to 20 ma signal, it is possible to transmit the signal over the longer distance. now if you see the another advantage of this standard, then this standard has the concept of live zero. that means here, the 4 ma represents the lowest value or the 0 of the full-scale value. for example, if the temperature sensor range is from 25c to 100c, then this 25c represents the 0 of the full-scale range, while if you see the 100c, then that represents the 100 of the full-scale range. that means here, in this 4 to 20 ma signal, the 0 of the measurement value is the 4 ma. but instead of the 4 ma, suppose the minimum value of the measurement range is kept 0 ma, then in that case, the 0 of the measurement value corresponds to 0 ma. and in that case, suppose there is a fault in the loop, or if there is a device failure or the broken wire, then we do not know whether it is due to the fault or due to the actual 0 of the measurement value. that means instead of the 4 to 20 ma, suppose the range is kept from 0 to 20 ma, then in that case, the fault finding becomes difficult. but in the case of the 4 to 20 ma standard, as the minimum signal is 4 ma, so whenever the signal is equal to 4 ma, then we know that the link is live and the measurement value is indeed 0 of the full-scale range. so that is the live zero concept. that means the value of the 0 measurement is higher than the 0 ma. and whenever the signal level drops below the 4 ma, or if it becomes 0 ma, then we know that there is some fault in the loop, like the broken wire or the device failure. so in this way, using the 4 to 20 ma standard, it becomes easy to identify the fault condition. now while this specific range is only kept, we will discuss it a little later. but that is another advantage of the 4 to 20 ma

Hs1augUS2bQ,BJT Cascode Amplifier Explained | Small-signal analysis of Cascode Amplifier,2025-06-01 18:50:19+00:00,2025,6,Sunday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the Cascode Amplifier. So we will see that what is Cascode amplifier, what are the advantages of this amplifier and then we will derive the equations for the voltage gain and the output impedance of this amplifier. So this Cascode amplifier is a high gain amplifier. And we will not get such a high voltage gain using the common emitter amplifier or using the any other configuration that we have discussed earlier. So as you know, among the common base, common emitter and the common collector amplifiers, common emitter amplifier provides the highest voltage gain. So if you recall, then the small signal circuit of this common emitter amplifier and the voltage gain can be given as - gm times this (RC || Ro). Where the Ro is the output impedance of this BJT. So let us put some numbers and let us see the typical value of the voltage gain that can be achieved using the common emitter amplifier. So let's say this VCC is equal to 5 volt and the amplifier circuit is biased with the collector current of 1 milliampere. That means here this IC is equal to 1 milliampere. So if you recall, then this transconductance gm can be given as this IC divided by VT. So typically at the room temperature, the value of the VT or the thermal voltage is equal to 26 millivolt. But here for the simplicity, let's say this VT is equal to 25 millivolt. That means here this gm will be equal to this 1 milliampere divided by 25 millivolt, and that is equal to 0.04. Moreover here let's say the early voltage VA is equal to 50 volt. So from this we can get the value of the Ro, because this Ro can be given as this VA divided by IC. And here that will be equal to 50 volt divided by 1 milliampere that is equal to 50 kΩ. And here if you see the value of the RC then it will not be more than the 2 kΩ. Because if the value of the RC is more than 2 kΩ then there will be a large voltage drop across this RC. And because of that this amplifier circuit will not operate in the active region. That means here this value of the RC will not be more than the 2 kΩ. So let's say that is equal to 2 kΩ. So now by putting all these values if we see the voltage gain then that is equal to minus 0.04 times this (2 kΩ || 50 kΩ). So this value is approximately equal to 2 kΩ. So we can say that this Vo divided by Vi is approximately equal to - (gm x Rc). And that is equal to  -0.04 times 2 kΩ. That is roughly equal to -80. So we can say that the magnitude of the voltage gain for this common emitter amplifier is equal to 80. So as you can see here if we want to increase the voltage gain then either we need to increase the value of the Rc, Or we need to increase the value of this transconductance. So as we have seen if we try to increase the value of the Rc then there will be a more voltage drop across this Rc, and because of that the amplifier will move out of the active region. That means here we cannot increase the value of the Rc beyond the certain range. So if we cannot increase the value of the RC then the second thing that we can do is to increase the value of the gm. So as you know this gm can be given as this IC divided by VT. So if we want to increase this transconductance then we need to increase the value of the collector current. So once again if we increase this collector current then the voltage drop across this resistor will also increase. And hence it is quite possible that the amplifier will move out of the active region. That means here we cannot increase the value of the gm and the Rc beyond the certain limit. So we can say that the voltage gain that we are getting with the common emitter amplifier with the resistive load configuration is the limited. So here instead of the passive resistive load if we use the active load such as the current source then it is possible to get the higher voltage gain. So for that let us replace this resistive load with the ideal current source. So for the ideal current source its output impedance will be equal to infinite. So if we see the small signal equivalent circuit then it will look like this and here this voltage gain is equal to - gm*Ro. So that is the maximum achievable voltage gain with the common emitter amplifier. So this gain is known as the intrinsic gain. So once again let us put some numbers and let us find out the typical value of this intrinsic gain. So once again let us assume that this bias current is equal to 1 milliampere. That means here this collector current is equal to 1 milliampere and with that, if we see the value of the transconductance then once again that will be equal to 0.04. And here let us assume that this Ro is once again 50 kΩ. So with that if we see the value of the intrinsic gain then that is equal to 0.04 x 50 kΩ, and that is equal to 2000. That means with the given parameters this is the maximum gain that can be achieved using the common emitter amplifier. But if we see the actual gain then that will be less than that. Because as you know the actual current source will have some finite output impedance and because of that the voltage gain will further reduce. So here let's say this current source is implemented using the PNP transistor. And let's say, its output impedance is equal to Rop. So, in this case, if we see the overall voltage gain then that is equal to gm* (Ron || Rop). Where the Ron is the output impedance of this NPN transistor while the Rop is the output impedance of this PNP transistor. So for a moment if we assume that this Ron is equal to Rop then in that case this voltage gain will become gm*R0 /2. So considering the previous values of the gm and the Ro, this voltage gain will be equal to (0.04 * 50 kΩ/ 2). That means this voltage gain is equal to 1000. So as you can see with the actual current source this voltage gain will further reduce from the intrinsic voltage gain. That means if we want to improve the voltage gain of this amplifier then somehow we need to increase the output impedance of this amplifier. And this cascode amplifier exactly does that. So if you see the cascode amplifier then it is the cascade connection of CE amplifier and the CB amplifier. So here this common emitter amplifier is the amplifying transistor and here if you see the common base amplifier then that is the cascode transistor. So as you can see over here the output of this common emitter amplifier is given as an input to the common base amplifier. And the overall output of the cascode amplifier is taken at the collector of the second transistor. So here for a time being this load is not shown in the figure but this load can be a resistive load or it can be a active load like the current source. But for a time being let's say there is some load that is connected to this cascode amplifier. So the advantage of this cascode amplifier is that it provides the high voltage gain and the high output resistance. So let's say if Ro is the output impedance of this common emitter stage then the output impedance of this cascode stage will be the K times R0. And in this way the output impedance of this cascode amplifier is higher. So here because of the higher output impedance, if we see the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier then that will be also higher. So let us understand the same thing using the small signal analysis. And let us derive the expressions for the output impedance and the voltage gain for this cascode amplifier. So here from the DC biasing perspective the second transistor Q2 is biased with some fixed voltage. But from the AC analysis perspective this base terminal will get connected to the ground potential. And similarly this DC voltage source will also get short circuited. So now let us replace this each transistor Q1 and Q2 by their small signal model. So overall if we see the small signal equivalent circuit of the cascode amplifier then it will look like this. So as you can see here the input is applied between the base and the emitter of the first transistor. And the collector of the first transistor is connected to the emitter of the second transistor. Then here the base of the second transistor is connected to the ground terminal. And as you can see here this output voltage is taken across the collector of the second transistor and the ground terminal. So here this Ro1 is the output impedance of this Q1 transistor while the Ro2 is the output impedance of this second transistor. So with this now let us find the output impedance of this overall cascode configuration. So now to find the output impedance of this amplifier what we will do, we will apply the test voltage VX at the output, And we will make all the independent sources in the circuit as zero. And in this condition we will find this current IX. So the ratio of this VX and the IX will give us the output impedance. So here as soon as we make this Vin as zero, then this Vπ1 will also become zero. And hence this independent current source gm1*Vπ1 will also become zero. That means now we will only have this output resistor Ro1 between the collector and the emitter terminals of the first transistor. And now if we see the equivalent circuit then it will look like this. So for the given circuit, now let us find the value of the output impedance. So here let's say this current is equal to Ix. So here this current Ix is entering at this node, and the same current will also flow out at this node. That means here the current that is going away from this node is also equal to Ix. Moreover if you see then here this ro1 and the Rπ2 are also connected in the parallel connection. Because here the one end of both resistors are connected at this node, while the other end is connected to the ground terminal. And here the voltage across both the resistors is equal to Vπ2. So now let us apply the KVL in the given circuit. So if we apply the KVL, then we can write this voltage VX is equal to Ix - (gm2 * Vπ2 *ro2), that is this voltage. Plus this Ix *( ro1 || Rπ2 ). Because here if you see then the Ro1 and the Rπ2 are connected in the parallel connection. And the current that is flowing into the equivalent resistance is equal to Ix. So if we see the voltage drop across that then that is equal to this Ix times the parallel combination of this Rπ1 and the Ro1. That is the this voltage. So here if we see this voltage then that is nothing but the - Vπ2. Because here the positive terminal of the Vπ2 is connected to the ground potential while the negative terminal is coming at this node. So we can say that this Vπ2 = - [ Ix *( r01 || Rπ2)]. So now in the above expression let us put the value of the Vπ2. So now we can write it as VX = Ix * r02 - gm2* Vπ2* r02 + Ix* (ro1 || Rπ2)  So, now if we put the value of Vπ2, then further we can write it as, Ix * r02 - gm2* r02* [- ix* (ro1 || Rπ2) ] + Ix* (ro1 || Rπ2)  So further if we simplify it, then we can write it as,  Vx = Ix*[ r02 + (ro1 || Rπ2) (1 + gm2*Ro2)] So, from this we can say that, this Vx / Ix, or the output impedance of this cascode stage is equal to r02 + (1 + gm2*Ro2) (ro1 || Rπ2)  So, here typically, this gm2*ro2 will be much greater than 1. So, apprximately we can say that this term is equal to gm2*Ro2. And further we can write this expression as ro2 + gm2*ro2*(ro1 || Rπ2) So, once again, let's take this ro2 common. That means further we can write it as Ro = ro2 [ 1 + gm2* (ro1 || Rπ2) ] So, once again if you see, then this gm2* (ro1 || Rπ2) will be much greater than 1. So, once again, here we can neglect this 1. And further we can write this expression as Ro = ro2*gm2* (ro1 || Rπ2) So, that is the expression of the output imepdance. So here as you know this Rπ2 is equal to β2/ gm2. So typically this R01 is much greater than Rπ2. And with that assumption we can approximately say that this Ro = gm2* r02 * Rπ2. And here if we put the value of this Rπ2 then we can say that this Ro = β2* r02. Where the rR02 is the output impedance of the Q2 transistor. So here if we assume that this Ro1=Ro2 ,and β1= β2, then we can say that this output impedance of this cascode stage is equal to β * Ro. That means suppose if the β is equal to 100, and the Ro is equal to 50 kΩ then in that case the value of the output impedance is equal to 5 MΩ. So in this way using the cascode amplifier we can improve the output impedance. So now to find the overall voltage gain we also need to find the transconductance of the overall amplifier. So what is a transconductance we have already seen in detail in the earlier videos. So basically it shows that if the small signal voltage changes by the small amount then how much change we will get in the output current. So the question is how to find that. So if the Vin is the input to the amplifier and Vo is the output then to find the transconductance what we will do, we will find the output current of this circuit. Let's say that is equal to Io. So the ratio of this output current to the input voltage will gives us the transconductance of the amplifier. That means the output current of the amplifier can be given as gm* Vi. And if we see the output voltage then this output voltage is equal to -Gm*Vi*Ro. So from this we can say that this Vo/ Vi,  or the voltage gain of this amplifier is equal to Gm*Ro. So we already know the expression of the output impedance. So the only thing that we need to find is the transconductance. And once we get that then we can find the overall voltage gain of this cascode amplifier. So let us find that. So first of all this is the small signal equivalent circuit of the cascode amplifier. So here to find the transconductance as you have seen, we will connect the output to the ground terminal and now we will find the output current in the circuit. So the ratio of this output current to the input voltage will gives us the transconductance of this cascode amplifier. So let us find that. So here once we connect the output to the ground terminal then here this Rπ2, r02 and the r01, all three are connected in the parallel connection. Because if you notice over here then the one end of these three resistors is connected at this point while the other end is connected to the ground potential. And moreover the voltage drop across all the three resistors is equal to Vπ2. So here if we apply the KCL at this node then we can say that this Io = gm2* Vπ2 + (Vπ2 /r02). Because here the voltage across this resistor is equal to Vπ2. That means this current will be equal to Vπ2/r02. And let's say this is the equation number 1. So similarly now let us apply the KCL at this node. So if we apply the KCL, then we can write this gm1* Vπ1, that is this current, that is equal to gm2* Vπ2 that is this current, plus Vπ2/ r02, that is this current, plus Vπ2 /Rπ2, that is this current, plus Vπ2 /r01, that is this current. Because here the voltage drop across this r01 is also equal to Vπ2. So all these currents are the incoming current, while the gm1* Vπ1 is the outgoing current. So further if we simplify it then we can write it as this gm1 *Vπ1 = Vπ2 [ gm2 + (1/ro2) +(1/ro1) + (1/ Rπ2)] So here we know that this Rπ2 = β2 /gm2. So, naturally this (1 / Rπ2) = gm2/ β2. And definitely it will be less than the gm2. So we can say that this gm2 is much greater than (1/ Rπ2). And similarly this gm2 will also be much greater than 1/ro1 and 1/r02. That means here we can neglect these three terms. And by neglecting these three terms we can write it as  gm1 * Vπ1 that is equal to gm2 * Vπ2. And let's say this is the equation number 2. So now using the equation number 1 and 2, let us find the ratio of the Io/Vin. So we know that this Io = gm2* Vπ2 + Vπ2 /r02. So here let's take this Vπ2 common, so if we take it out then further we can write it as, gm2 + (1/Ro2). So once again over here this gm2 >> (1/Ro2).  And hence we can say that this Io = gm2*Vπ2. And earlier we have seen that this gm1*Vπ1 is approximately equal to gm2* Vπ2. So from this we can say that this Io = gm1* Vπ1. And here as you know this Vπ1 is nothing but the Vi. So we can say that this Io = gm1*Vi. And from this we can say that this Io / Vi is equal to gm1. That means the overall transconductance of this cascode amplifier is approximately equal to gm1. So now the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier is equal to Gm* R0. Where the Gm is the transconductance of cascode amplifier  And Ro is the output impedance of the cascode stage. So as we have see, this Gm = gm1, and earlier we have seen that, this Ro = gm2* ro2 [ r01|| Rπ2 ]  So here for a moment if we assume that this gm1= gm2 and ro1 = ro2, then this voltage gain can be given as this gm*R0*gm* (ro || Rπ) So typically the value of this parallel combination will always be less than the Rπ. But for a moment let's assume that this r0 is much greater than Rπ, in that case this (ro || Rπ) is approximately equal to Rπ. So the maximum value of the voltage gain will be equal to this (gm*ro)x (gm* Rπ). And as you know this (gm* Rπ) is nothing but the β. Because we know that this Rπ = β /gm. So from this we can say that the maximum value of the voltage gain is equal to β*gm*Ro. Where gm*ro is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter stage. So, we can say that, the maximum value of the voltage gain for the cascode amplifier is equal to β * A0. Where the A0 is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter stage. So as you can see due to this cascode configuration the gain and the output impedance of the amplifier increases by the factor of β. So if you use the same value of the Ro, β and the transconductance gm, which we have used earlier then the magnitude of the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier will be equal to 100 x 0.04 x 50 kΩ. That is the value of gm and Ro. And that is equal to 100 x 2000. So, that is equal to 2 x 10^5.  So, as you can see, using the cascode amplifier, the output impedance and the voltage gain of the amplifier will increase substantially.  And if see  the actual value of the gain and the output impedance,  then that will depend on the load.  So, if we use the cascode amplifier with the resistive load, then we won't see any improvement in the voltage gain or the output impedance. Because if we use the resistive load, then on the output side, this Ro of the cascode amplifier will come in parallel with Rc.  And now, this voltage gain is equal to Gm* [Ro || Rc] So, typically the value of Rc is much less than Ro. So, due to that we can say that, this voltage gain is equal to Gm*Rc. And that is equal to gm1*Rc. So, as you can see, it same as the voltage gain of the common emitter amplifier.  That means if we use the resistive load with the cascode amplifier, then we will not get any improvement in the voltage gain.  So, to utilise the cascode effect we need to use the active load such as the current source.  So for a moment, if we assume that, the connected current source is the ideal current source, then its output impedance will be equal to infinite.  And in that case, if we see the small-signal equivalent circuit on the output side, then it will look like this. So, in this case, this voltage gain is equal to -Gm*Ro, where the Ro is the output impedance of this cascode amplifier. That means if we use the ideal current source, then in that case, we can get the maximum voltage gain using the cascode amplifier.  But as you know, no current source is ideal and it has some finite output impedance. So, due to that, the actual voltage gain will be lesser.  So, for example, if we use the PNP transistor as the current source, then in that case, let's say, its output impedance is equal to ro3. So, in that case, if we see the voltage gain, then this voltage gain is equal to -Gm*[Ro || ro3] Or if we just consider the magnitude, then that is equal to Gm*[Ro || ro3] So, typically, this Ro is much greater than ro3. That means the output impedance of the cascode stage is much greater than the output impedance of the PNP transistor.  And due to that, we can say that, this voltage gain is approximately equal to Gm*ro3. That means. if we use the PNP transistor as the current source, then in that case, the overall voltage gain is approximately equal to gm1*ro3. And this gain is almost same as the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier.  So, as you can see, still it is less than the maximum gain that can be achieved using the cascode amplifier.  That means, if we want to achieve the voltage gain that is close to the maximum achievable gain using the cascode amplifier then we also need to use the cascode current source. So, here the cascode current source is implemented using the two PNP transistors.  So, here let's say, the output impedance of this Q3 transistor is equal to ro3, while the output impedance of the Q4 transistor is equal to ro4. So, here if we see the output impedance from here, then that will be equal to ro4. While if we see the output impedance from this end,  then that will be equal to gm3*ro3* [ ro4 || Rπ3 ]. That is the output impedance of the PNP cascode current source.  So, now what we can do, we can connect this cascode current source to the cascode amplifier.  And if we do that, then this is how it will look like. So, here these two transistors represents the cascode current source,  while these two transistors shows the cascode amplifier stage.  So, now for the AC analysis, all the DC sources in the circuit will act as zero.  And now, this cascode current source can be replaced by the equivalent output resistance.  So, from this we can say that, the overall voltage gain of this amplifier is equal to Gm* [ Ron || Rop ].  Where the Ron is equivalent output impedance which is seen through the NPN cascode amplifier,   While the Rop is output impedance of the PNP cascode current source.  So, we know that, this Ron= gm2*ro2* [ ro1 || Rπ2 ] And this Rop = gm3*ro3* [ ro4 || Rπ3 ] So, the maximum value of Ron is approximately equal to β2*ro2.  Because if this ro1 is much greater than Rπ2, then this term is approximately equal to Rπ2. And then this gm2 * Rπ2 = β2 So, the maximum value of the Ron is equal to β2*ro2.  And likewise, the maximum value of the Rop = β3*ro3. So, typically Ron is more than Rop. But for a moment let's assume that, both are equal.  That means this Ron is same as Rop.  So, when they are connected in the parallel connection, then the overall output resistance will become half.  That means now, if we see the overall voltage gain, then that is equal to Gm*Ro/2. And we know that, the transconductance of this cascode stage is equal to gm1.  So, we can say that, the overall voltage gain will be equal to gm1*β*ro/2. And for a moment let's assume that gm of all transistors is also same.  So, we can say that, the overall voltage gain is equal to gm*ro*β/2. And we know that this gm*ro is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier.  So, we can say that this overall voltage gain is equal to β*Ao/2. So, that is half of the maximum achievable gain using the cascode amplifier.  So for example, if β = 100, this gm = 0.04, ro = 50 kΩ, then this voltage gain will become 100 x 0.04 x 50 kΩ / 2. And that is equal to 10^5. So, still it is higher than the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier.  So, in this way, using the BJT cascode amplifier along with the cascode current source it is possible to achieve the higher voltage gain.  But the only drawback with this configuration is that, as there is a drop across each transistor,  so the effective voltage that is available to the common emitter stage will get reduce.  And hence, the voltage swing will also be limited.  So, if we want to increase the voltage swing again, then we need to apply the higher supply voltage.  And effectively, that will increase the power consumption.  So, that is the only drawback with this cascode amplifier.  But in the applications where we want the higher voltage gain, this configuration is suitable.    So, I hope in this video you understood, how using the cascode amplifier along with the cascode current source it is possible to achieve the higher voltage gain and the higher output impednace. So if you have any question or suggestion then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video hit the like button and subscribe the channel for more such videos.",bjt cascode amplifier explained small-signal analysis of cascode amplifier,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the cascode amplifier. so we will see that what is cascode amplifier, what are the advantages of this amplifier and then we will derive the equations for the voltage gain and the output impedance of this amplifier. so this cascode amplifier is a high gain amplifier. and we will not get such a high voltage gain using the common emitter amplifier or using the any other configuration that we have discussed earlier. so as you know, among the common base, common emitter and the common collector amplifiers, common emitter amplifier provides the highest voltage gain. so if you recall, then the small signal circuit of this common emitter amplifier and the voltage gain can be given as - gm times this rc ro. where the ro is the output impedance of this bjt. so let us put some numbers and let us see the typical value of the voltage gain that can be achieved using the common emitter amplifier. so lets say this vcc is equal to 5 volt and the amplifier circuit is biased with the collector current of 1 milliampere. that means here this ic is equal to 1 milliampere. so if you recall, then this transconductance gm can be given as this ic divided by vt. so typically at the room temperature, the value of the vt or the thermal voltage is equal to 26 millivolt. but here for the simplicity, lets say this vt is equal to 25 millivolt. that means here this gm will be equal to this 1 milliampere divided by 25 millivolt, and that is equal to 0.04. moreover here lets say the early voltage va is equal to 50 volt. so from this we can get the value of the ro, because this ro can be given as this va divided by ic. and here that will be equal to 50 volt divided by 1 milliampere that is equal to 50 kω. and here if you see the value of the rc then it will not be more than the 2 kω. because if the value of the rc is more than 2 kω then there will be a large voltage drop across this rc. and because of that this amplifier circuit will not operate in the active region. that means here this value of the rc will not be more than the 2 kω. so lets say that is equal to 2 kω. so now by putting all these values if we see the voltage gain then that is equal to minus 0.04 times this 2 kω 50 kω. so this value is approximately equal to 2 kω. so we can say that this vo divided by vi is approximately equal to - gm x rc. and that is equal to -0.04 times 2 kω. that is roughly equal to -80. so we can say that the magnitude of the voltage gain for this common emitter amplifier is equal to 80. so as you can see here if we want to increase the voltage gain then either we need to increase the value of the rc, or we need to increase the value of this transconductance. so as we have seen if we try to increase the value of the rc then there will be a more voltage drop across this rc, and because of that the amplifier will move out of the active region. that means here we cannot increase the value of the rc beyond the certain range. so if we cannot increase the value of the rc then the second thing that we can do is to increase the value of the gm. so as you know this gm can be given as this ic divided by vt. so if we want to increase this transconductance then we need to increase the value of the collector current. so once again if we increase this collector current then the voltage drop across this resistor will also increase. and hence it is quite possible that the amplifier will move out of the active region. that means here we cannot increase the value of the gm and the rc beyond the certain limit. so we can say that the voltage gain that we are getting with the common emitter amplifier with the resistive load configuration is the limited. so here instead of the passive resistive load if we use the active load such as the current source then it is possible to get the higher voltage gain. so for that let us replace this resistive load with the ideal current source. so for the ideal current source its output impedance will be equal to infinite. so if we see the small signal equivalent circuit then it will look like this and here this voltage gain is equal to - gmro. so that is the maximum achievable voltage gain with the common emitter amplifier. so this gain is known as the intrinsic gain. so once again let us put some numbers and let us find out the typical value of this intrinsic gain. so once again let us assume that this bias current is equal to 1 milliampere. that means here this collector current is equal to 1 milliampere and with that, if we see the value of the transconductance then once again that will be equal to 0.04. and here let us assume that this ro is once again 50 kω. so with that if we see the value of the intrinsic gain then that is equal to 0.04 x 50 kω, and that is equal to 2000. that means with the given parameters this is the maximum gain that can be achieved using the common emitter amplifier. but if we see the actual gain then that will be less than that. because as you know the actual current source will have some finite output impedance and because of that the voltage gain will further reduce. so here lets say this current source is implemented using the pnp transistor. and lets say, its output impedance is equal to rop. so, in this case, if we see the overall voltage gain then that is equal to gm ron rop. where the ron is the output impedance of this npn transistor while the rop is the output impedance of this pnp transistor. so for a moment if we assume that this ron is equal to rop then in that case this voltage gain will become gmr0 2. so considering the previous values of the gm and the ro, this voltage gain will be equal to 0.04 50 kω 2. that means this voltage gain is equal to 1000. so as you can see with the actual current source this voltage gain will further reduce from the intrinsic voltage gain. that means if we want to improve the voltage gain of this amplifier then somehow we need to increase the output impedance of this amplifier. and this cascode amplifier exactly does that. so if you see the cascode amplifier then it is the cascade connection of ce amplifier and the cb amplifier. so here this common emitter amplifier is the amplifying transistor and here if you see the common base amplifier then that is the cascode transistor. so as you can see over here the output of this common emitter amplifier is given as an input to the common base amplifier. and the overall output of the cascode amplifier is taken at the collector of the second transistor. so here for a time being this load is not shown in the figure but this load can be a resistive load or it can be a active load like the current source. but for a time being lets say there is some load that is connected to this cascode amplifier. so the advantage of this cascode amplifier is that it provides the high voltage gain and the high output resistance. so lets say if ro is the output impedance of this common emitter stage then the output impedance of this cascode stage will be the k times r0. and in this way the output impedance of this cascode amplifier is higher. so here because of the higher output impedance, if we see the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier then that will be also higher. so let us understand the same thing using the small signal analysis. and let us derive the expressions for the output impedance and the voltage gain for this cascode amplifier. so here from the dc biasing perspective the second transistor q2 is biased with some fixed voltage. but from the ac analysis perspective this base terminal will get connected to the ground potential. and similarly this dc voltage source will also get short circuited. so now let us replace this each transistor q1 and q2 by their small signal model. so overall if we see the small signal equivalent circuit of the cascode amplifier then it will look like this. so as you can see here the input is applied between the base and the emitter of the first transistor. and the collector of the first transistor is connected to the emitter of the second transistor. then here the base of the second transistor is connected to the ground terminal. and as you can see here this output voltage is taken across the collector of the second transistor and the ground terminal. so here this ro1 is the output impedance of this q1 transistor while the ro2 is the output impedance of this second transistor. so with this now let us find the output impedance of this overall cascode configuration. so now to find the output impedance of this amplifier what we will do, we will apply the test voltage vx at the output, and we will make all the independent sources in the circuit as zero. and in this condition we will find this current ix. so the ratio of this vx and the ix will give us the output impedance. so here as soon as we make this vin as zero, then this vπ1 will also become zero. and hence this independent current source gm1vπ1 will also become zero. that means now we will only have this output resistor ro1 between the collector and the emitter terminals of the first transistor. and now if we see the equivalent circuit then it will look like this. so for the given circuit, now let us find the value of the output impedance. so here lets say this current is equal to ix. so here this current ix is entering at this node, and the same current will also flow out at this node. that means here the current that is going away from this node is also equal to ix. moreover if you see then here this ro1 and the rπ2 are also connected in the parallel connection. because here the one end of both resistors are connected at this node, while the other end is connected to the ground terminal. and here the voltage across both the resistors is equal to vπ2. so now let us apply the kvl in the given circuit. so if we apply the kvl, then we can write this voltage vx is equal to ix - gm2 vπ2 ro2, that is this voltage. plus this ix ro1 rπ2 . because here if you see then the ro1 and the rπ2 are connected in the parallel connection. and the current that is flowing into the equivalent resistance is equal to ix. so if we see the voltage drop across that then that is equal to this ix times the parallel combination of this rπ1 and the ro1. that is the this voltage. so here if we see this voltage then that is nothing but the - vπ2. because here the positive terminal of the vπ2 is connected to the ground potential while the negative terminal is coming at this node. so we can say that this vπ2 - ix r01 rπ2. so now in the above expression let us put the value of the vπ2. so now we can write it as vx ix r02 - gm2 vπ2 r02 ix ro1 rπ2 so, now if we put the value of vπ2, then further we can write it as, ix r02 - gm2 r02 - ix ro1 rπ2 ix ro1 rπ2 so further if we simplify it, then we can write it as, vx ix r02 ro1 rπ2 1 gm2ro2 so, from this we can say that, this vx ix, or the output impedance of this cascode stage is equal to r02 1 gm2ro2 ro1 rπ2 so, here typically, this gm2ro2 will be much greater than 1. so, apprximately we can say that this term is equal to gm2ro2. and further we can write this expression as ro2 gm2ro2ro1 rπ2 so, once again, lets take this ro2 common. that means further we can write it as ro ro2 1 gm2 ro1 rπ2 so, once again if you see, then this gm2 ro1 rπ2 will be much greater than 1. so, once again, here we can neglect this 1. and further we can write this expression as ro ro2gm2 ro1 rπ2 so, that is the expression of the output imepdance. so here as you know this rπ2 is equal to β2 gm2. so typically this r01 is much greater than rπ2. and with that assumption we can approximately say that this ro gm2 r02 rπ2. and here if we put the value of this rπ2 then we can say that this ro β2 r02. where the rr02 is the output impedance of the q2 transistor. so here if we assume that this ro1ro2 ,and β1 β2, then we can say that this output impedance of this cascode stage is equal to β ro. that means suppose if the β is equal to 100, and the ro is equal to 50 kω then in that case the value of the output impedance is equal to 5 mω. so in this way using the cascode amplifier we can improve the output impedance. so now to find the overall voltage gain we also need to find the transconductance of the overall amplifier. so what is a transconductance we have already seen in detail in the earlier videos. so basically it shows that if the small signal voltage changes by the small amount then how much change we will get in the output current. so the question is how to find that. so if the vin is the input to the amplifier and vo is the output then to find the transconductance what we will do, we will find the output current of this circuit. lets say that is equal to io. so the ratio of this output current to the input voltage will gives us the transconductance of the amplifier. that means the output current of the amplifier can be given as gm vi. and if we see the output voltage then this output voltage is equal to -gmviro. so from this we can say that this vo vi, or the voltage gain of this amplifier is equal to gmro. so we already know the expression of the output impedance. so the only thing that we need to find is the transconductance. and once we get that then we can find the overall voltage gain of this cascode amplifier. so let us find that. so first of all this is the small signal equivalent circuit of the cascode amplifier. so here to find the transconductance as you have seen, we will connect the output to the ground terminal and now we will find the output current in the circuit. so the ratio of this output current to the input voltage will gives us the transconductance of this cascode amplifier. so let us find that. so here once we connect the output to the ground terminal then here this rπ2, r02 and the r01, all three are connected in the parallel connection. because if you notice over here then the one end of these three resistors is connected at this point while the other end is connected to the ground potential. and moreover the voltage drop across all the three resistors is equal to vπ2. so here if we apply the kcl at this node then we can say that this io gm2 vπ2 vπ2 r02. because here the voltage across this resistor is equal to vπ2. that means this current will be equal to vπ2r02. and lets say this is the equation number 1. so similarly now let us apply the kcl at this node. so if we apply the kcl, then we can write this gm1 vπ1, that is this current, that is equal to gm2 vπ2 that is this current, plus vπ2 r02, that is this current, plus vπ2 rπ2, that is this current, plus vπ2 r01, that is this current. because here the voltage drop across this r01 is also equal to vπ2. so all these currents are the incoming current, while the gm1 vπ1 is the outgoing current. so further if we simplify it then we can write it as this gm1 vπ1 vπ2 gm2 1ro2 1ro1 1 rπ2 so here we know that this rπ2 β2 gm2. so, naturally this 1 rπ2 gm2 β2. and definitely it will be less than the gm2. so we can say that this gm2 is much greater than 1 rπ2. and similarly this gm2 will also be much greater than 1ro1 and 1r02. that means here we can neglect these three terms. and by neglecting these three terms we can write it as gm1 vπ1 that is equal to gm2 vπ2. and lets say this is the equation number 2. so now using the equation number 1 and 2, let us find the ratio of the iovin. so we know that this io gm2 vπ2 vπ2 r02. so here lets take this vπ2 common, so if we take it out then further we can write it as, gm2 1ro2. so once again over here this gm2 1ro2. and hence we can say that this io gm2vπ2. and earlier we have seen that this gm1vπ1 is approximately equal to gm2 vπ2. so from this we can say that this io gm1 vπ1. and here as you know this vπ1 is nothing but the vi. so we can say that this io gm1vi. and from this we can say that this io vi is equal to gm1. that means the overall transconductance of this cascode amplifier is approximately equal to gm1. so now the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier is equal to gm r0. where the gm is the transconductance of cascode amplifier and ro is the output impedance of the cascode stage. so as we have see, this gm gm1, and earlier we have seen that, this ro gm2 ro2 r01 rπ2 so here for a moment if we assume that this gm1 gm2 and ro1 ro2, then this voltage gain can be given as this gmr0gm ro rπ so typically the value of this parallel combination will always be less than the rπ. but for a moment lets assume that this r0 is much greater than rπ, in that case this ro rπ is approximately equal to rπ. so the maximum value of the voltage gain will be equal to this gmrox gm rπ. and as you know this gm rπ is nothing but the β. because we know that this rπ β gm. so from this we can say that the maximum value of the voltage gain is equal to βgmro. where gmro is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter stage. so, we can say that, the maximum value of the voltage gain for the cascode amplifier is equal to β a0. where the a0 is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter stage. so as you can see due to this cascode configuration the gain and the output impedance of the amplifier increases by the factor of β. so if you use the same value of the ro, β and the transconductance gm, which we have used earlier then the magnitude of the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier will be equal to 100 x 0.04 x 50 kω. that is the value of gm and ro. and that is equal to 100 x 2000. so, that is equal to 2 x 105. so, as you can see, using the cascode amplifier, the output impedance and the voltage gain of the amplifier will increase substantially. and if see the actual value of the gain and the output impedance, then that will depend on the load. so, if we use the cascode amplifier with the resistive load, then we wont see any improvement in the voltage gain or the output impedance. because if we use the resistive load, then on the output side, this ro of the cascode amplifier will come in parallel with rc. and now, this voltage gain is equal to gm ro rc so, typically the value of rc is much less than ro. so, due to that we can say that, this voltage gain is equal to gmrc. and that is equal to gm1rc. so, as you can see, it same as the voltage gain of the common emitter amplifier. that means if we use the resistive load with the cascode amplifier, then we will not get any improvement in the voltage gain. so, to utilise the cascode effect we need to use the active load such as the current source. so for a moment, if we assume that, the connected current source is the ideal current source, then its output impedance will be equal to infinite. and in that case, if we see the small-signal equivalent circuit on the output side, then it will look like this. so, in this case, this voltage gain is equal to -gmro, where the ro is the output impedance of this cascode amplifier. that means if we use the ideal current source, then in that case, we can get the maximum voltage gain using the cascode amplifier. but as you know, no current source is ideal and it has some finite output impedance. so, due to that, the actual voltage gain will be lesser. so, for example, if we use the pnp transistor as the current source, then in that case, lets say, its output impedance is equal to ro3. so, in that case, if we see the voltage gain, then this voltage gain is equal to -gmro ro3 or if we just consider the magnitude, then that is equal to gmro ro3 so, typically, this ro is much greater than ro3. that means the output impedance of the cascode stage is much greater than the output impedance of the pnp transistor. and due to that, we can say that, this voltage gain is approximately equal to gmro3. that means. if we use the pnp transistor as the current source, then in that case, the overall voltage gain is approximately equal to gm1ro3. and this gain is almost same as the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier. so, as you can see, still it is less than the maximum gain that can be achieved using the cascode amplifier. that means, if we want to achieve the voltage gain that is close to the maximum achievable gain using the cascode amplifier then we also need to use the cascode current source. so, here the cascode current source is implemented using the two pnp transistors. so, here lets say, the output impedance of this q3 transistor is equal to ro3, while the output impedance of the q4 transistor is equal to ro4. so, here if we see the output impedance from here, then that will be equal to ro4. while if we see the output impedance from this end, then that will be equal to gm3ro3 ro4 rπ3 . that is the output impedance of the pnp cascode current source. so, now what we can do, we can connect this cascode current source to the cascode amplifier. and if we do that, then this is how it will look like. so, here these two transistors represents the cascode current source, while these two transistors shows the cascode amplifier stage. so, now for the ac analysis, all the dc sources in the circuit will act as zero. and now, this cascode current source can be replaced by the equivalent output resistance. so, from this we can say that, the overall voltage gain of this amplifier is equal to gm ron rop . where the ron is equivalent output impedance which is seen through the npn cascode amplifier, while the rop is output impedance of the pnp cascode current source. so, we know that, this ron gm2ro2 ro1 rπ2 and this rop gm3ro3 ro4 rπ3 so, the maximum value of ron is approximately equal to β2ro2. because if this ro1 is much greater than rπ2, then this term is approximately equal to rπ2. and then this gm2 rπ2 β2 so, the maximum value of the ron is equal to β2ro2. and likewise, the maximum value of the rop β3ro3. so, typically ron is more than rop. but for a moment lets assume that, both are equal. that means this ron is same as rop. so, when they are connected in the parallel connection, then the overall output resistance will become half. that means now, if we see the overall voltage gain, then that is equal to gmro2. and we know that, the transconductance of this cascode stage is equal to gm1. so, we can say that, the overall voltage gain will be equal to gm1βro2. and for a moment lets assume that gm of all transistors is also same. so, we can say that, the overall voltage gain is equal to gmroβ2. and we know that this gmro is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier. so, we can say that this overall voltage gain is equal to βao2. so, that is half of the maximum achievable gain using the cascode amplifier. so for example, if β 100, this gm 0.04, ro 50 kω, then this voltage gain will become 100 x 0.04 x 50 kω 2. and that is equal to 105. so, still it is higher than the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier. so, in this way, using the bjt cascode amplifier along with the cascode current source it is possible to achieve the higher voltage gain. but the only drawback with this configuration is that, as there is a drop across each transistor, so the effective voltage that is available to the common emitter stage will get reduce. and hence, the voltage swing will also be limited. so, if we want to increase the voltage swing again, then we need to apply the higher supply voltage. and effectively, that will increase the power consumption. so, that is the only drawback with this cascode amplifier. but in the applications where we want the higher voltage gain, this configuration is suitable. so, i hope in this video you understood, how using the cascode amplifier along with the cascode current source it is possible to achieve the higher voltage gain and the higher output impednace. so if you

amplifier explained small-signal analysis of cascode amplifier hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the cascode amplifier. so we will see that what is cascode amplifier, what are the advantages of this amplifier and then we will derive the equations for the voltage gain and the output impedance of this amplifier. so this cascode amplifier is a high gain amplifier. and we will not get such a high voltage gain using the common emitter amplifier or using the any other configuration that we have discussed earlier. so as you know, among the common base, common emitter and the common collector amplifiers, common emitter amplifier provides the highest voltage gain. so if you recall, then the small signal circuit of this common emitter amplifier and the voltage gain can be given as - gm times this rc ro. where the ro is the output impedance of this bjt. so let us put some numbers and let us see the typical value of the voltage gain that can be achieved using the common emitter amplifier. so lets say this vcc is equal to 5 volt and the amplifier circuit is biased with the collector current of 1 milliampere. that means here this ic is equal to 1 milliampere. so if you recall, then this transconductance gm can be given as this ic divided by vt. so typically at the room temperature, the value of the vt or the thermal voltage is equal to 26 millivolt. but here for the simplicity, lets say this vt is equal to 25 millivolt. that means here this gm will be equal to this 1 milliampere divided by 25 millivolt, and that is equal to 0.04. moreover here lets say the early voltage va is equal to 50 volt. so from this we can get the value of the ro, because this ro can be given as this va divided by ic. and here that will be equal to 50 volt divided by 1 milliampere that is equal to 50 kω. and here if you see the value of the rc then it will not be more than the 2 kω. because if the value of the rc is more than 2 kω then there will be a large voltage drop across this rc. and because of that this amplifier circuit will not operate in the active region. that means here this value of the rc will not be more than the 2 kω. so lets say that is equal to 2 kω. so now by putting all these values if we see the voltage gain then that is equal to minus 0.04 times this 2 kω 50 kω. so this value is approximately equal to 2 kω. so we can say that this vo divided by vi is approximately equal to - gm x rc. and that is equal to -0.04 times 2 kω. that is roughly equal to -80. so we can say that the magnitude of the voltage gain for this common emitter amplifier is equal to 80. so as you can see here if we want to increase the voltage gain then either we need to increase the value of the rc, or we need to increase the value of this transconductance. so as we have seen if we try to increase the value of the rc then there will be a more voltage drop across this rc, and because of that the amplifier will move out of the active region. that means here we cannot increase the value of the rc beyond the certain range. so if we cannot increase the value of the rc then the second thing that we can do is to increase the value of the gm. so as you know this gm can be given as this ic divided by vt. so if we want to increase this transconductance then we need to increase the value of the collector current. so once again if we increase this collector current then the voltage drop across this resistor will also increase. and hence it is quite possible that the amplifier will move out of the active region. that means here we cannot increase the value of the gm and the rc beyond the certain limit. so we can say that the voltage gain that we are getting with the common emitter amplifier with the resistive load configuration is the limited. so here instead of the passive resistive load if we use the active load such as the current source then it is possible to get the higher voltage gain. so for that let us replace this resistive load with the ideal current source. so for the ideal current source its output impedance will be equal to infinite. so if we see the small signal equivalent circuit then it will look like this and here this voltage gain is equal to - gmro. so that is the maximum achievable voltage gain with the common emitter amplifier. so this gain is known as the intrinsic gain. so once again let us put some numbers and let us find out the typical value of this intrinsic gain. so once again let us assume that this bias current is equal to 1 milliampere. that means here this collector current is equal to 1 milliampere and with that, if we see the value of the transconductance then once again that will be equal to 0.04. and here let us assume that this ro is once again 50 kω. so with that if we see the value of the intrinsic gain then that is equal to 0.04 x 50 kω, and that is equal to 2000. that means with the given parameters this is the maximum gain that can be achieved using the common emitter amplifier. but if we see the actual gain then that will be less than that. because as you know the actual current source will have some finite output impedance and because of that the voltage gain will further reduce. so here lets say this current source is implemented using the pnp transistor. and lets say, its output impedance is equal to rop. so, in this case, if we see the overall voltage gain then that is equal to gm ron rop. where the ron is the output impedance of this npn transistor while the rop is the output impedance of this pnp transistor. so for a moment if we assume that this ron is equal to rop then in that case this voltage gain will become gmr0 2. so considering the previous values of the gm and the ro, this voltage gain will be equal to 0.04 50 kω 2. that means this voltage gain is equal to 1000. so as you can see with the actual current source this voltage gain will further reduce from the intrinsic voltage gain. that means if we want to improve the voltage gain of this amplifier then somehow we need to increase the output impedance of this amplifier. and this cascode amplifier exactly does that. so if you see the cascode amplifier then it is the cascade connection of ce amplifier and the cb amplifier. so here this common emitter amplifier is the amplifying transistor and here if you see the common base amplifier then that is the cascode transistor. so as you can see over here the output of this common emitter amplifier is given as an input to the common base amplifier. and the overall output of the cascode amplifier is taken at the collector of the second transistor. so here for a time being this load is not shown in the figure but this load can be a resistive load or it can be a active load like the current source. but for a time being lets say there is some load that is connected to this cascode amplifier. so the advantage of this cascode amplifier is that it provides the high voltage gain and the high output resistance. so lets say if ro is the output impedance of this common emitter stage then the output impedance of this cascode stage will be the k times r0. and in this way the output impedance of this cascode amplifier is higher. so here because of the higher output impedance, if we see the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier then that will be also higher. so let us understand the same thing using the small signal analysis. and let us derive the expressions for the output impedance and the voltage gain for this cascode amplifier. so here from the dc biasing perspective the second transistor q2 is biased with some fixed voltage. but from the ac analysis perspective this base terminal will get connected to the ground potential. and similarly this dc voltage source will also get short circuited. so now let us replace this each transistor q1 and q2 by their small signal model. so overall if we see the small signal equivalent circuit of the cascode amplifier then it will look like this. so as you can see here the input is applied between the base and the emitter of the first transistor. and the collector of the first transistor is connected to the emitter of the second transistor. then here the base of the second transistor is connected to the ground terminal. and as you can see here this output voltage is taken across the collector of the second transistor and the ground terminal. so here this ro1 is the output impedance of this q1 transistor while the ro2 is the output impedance of this second transistor. so with this now let us find the output impedance of this overall cascode configuration. so now to find the output impedance of this amplifier what we will do, we will apply the test voltage vx at the output, and we will make all the independent sources in the circuit as zero. and in this condition we will find this current ix. so the ratio of this vx and the ix will give us the output impedance. so here as soon as we make this vin as zero, then this vπ1 will also become zero. and hence this independent current source gm1vπ1 will also become zero. that means now we will only have this output resistor ro1 between the collector and the emitter terminals of the first transistor. and now if we see the equivalent circuit then it will look like this. so for the given circuit, now let us find the value of the output impedance. so here lets say this current is equal to ix. so here this current ix is entering at this node, and the same current will also flow out at this node. that means here the current that is going away from this node is also equal to ix. moreover if you see then here this ro1 and the rπ2 are also connected in the parallel connection. because here the one end of both resistors are connected at this node, while the other end is connected to the ground terminal. and here the voltage across both the resistors is equal to vπ2. so now let us apply the kvl in the given circuit. so if we apply the kvl, then we can write this voltage vx is equal to ix - gm2 vπ2 ro2, that is this voltage. plus this ix ro1 rπ2 . because here if you see then the ro1 and the rπ2 are connected in the parallel connection. and the current that is flowing into the equivalent resistance is equal to ix. so if we see the voltage drop across that then that is equal to this ix times the parallel combination of this rπ1 and the ro1. that is the this voltage. so here if we see this voltage then that is nothing but the - vπ2. because here the positive terminal of the vπ2 is connected to the ground potential while the negative terminal is coming at this node. so we can say that this vπ2 - ix r01 rπ2. so now in the above expression let us put the value of the vπ2. so now we can write it as vx ix r02 - gm2 vπ2 r02 ix ro1 rπ2 so, now if we put the value of vπ2, then further we can write it as, ix r02 - gm2 r02 - ix ro1 rπ2 ix ro1 rπ2 so further if we simplify it, then we can write it as, vx ix r02 ro1 rπ2 1 gm2ro2 so, from this we can say that, this vx ix, or the output impedance of this cascode stage is equal to r02 1 gm2ro2 ro1 rπ2 so, here typically, this gm2ro2 will be much greater than 1. so, apprximately we can say that this term is equal to gm2ro2. and further we can write this expression as ro2 gm2ro2ro1 rπ2 so, once again, lets take this ro2 common. that means further we can write it as ro ro2 1 gm2 ro1 rπ2 so, once again if you see, then this gm2 ro1 rπ2 will be much greater than 1. so, once again, here we can neglect this 1. and further we can write this expression as ro ro2gm2 ro1 rπ2 so, that is the expression of the output imepdance. so here as you know this rπ2 is equal to β2 gm2. so typically this r01 is much greater than rπ2. and with that assumption we can approximately say that this ro gm2 r02 rπ2. and here if we put the value of this rπ2 then we can say that this ro β2 r02. where the rr02 is the output impedance of the q2 transistor. so here if we assume that this ro1ro2 ,and β1 β2, then we can say that this output impedance of this cascode stage is equal to β ro. that means suppose if the β is equal to 100, and the ro is equal to 50 kω then in that case the value of the output impedance is equal to 5 mω. so in this way using the cascode amplifier we can improve the output impedance. so now to find the overall voltage gain we also need to find the transconductance of the overall amplifier. so what is a transconductance we have already seen in detail in the earlier videos. so basically it shows that if the small signal voltage changes by the small amount then how much change we will get in the output current. so the question is how to find that. so if the vin is the input to the amplifier and vo is the output then to find the transconductance what we will do, we will find the output current of this circuit. lets say that is equal to io. so the ratio of this output current to the input voltage will gives us the transconductance of the amplifier. that means the output current of the amplifier can be given as gm vi. and if we see the output voltage then this output voltage is equal to -gmviro. so from this we can say that this vo vi, or the voltage gain of this amplifier is equal to gmro. so we already know the expression of the output impedance. so the only thing that we need to find is the transconductance. and once we get that then we can find the overall voltage gain of this cascode amplifier. so let us find that. so first of all this is the small signal equivalent circuit of the cascode amplifier. so here to find the transconductance as you have seen, we will connect the output to the ground terminal and now we will find the output current in the circuit. so the ratio of this output current to the input voltage will gives us the transconductance of this cascode amplifier. so let us find that. so here once we connect the output to the ground terminal then here this rπ2, r02 and the r01, all three are connected in the parallel connection. because if you notice over here then the one end of these three resistors is connected at this point while the other end is connected to the ground potential. and moreover the voltage drop across all the three resistors is equal to vπ2. so here if we apply the kcl at this node then we can say that this io gm2 vπ2 vπ2 r02. because here the voltage across this resistor is equal to vπ2. that means this current will be equal to vπ2r02. and lets say this is the equation number 1. so similarly now let us apply the kcl at this node. so if we apply the kcl, then we can write this gm1 vπ1, that is this current, that is equal to gm2 vπ2 that is this current, plus vπ2 r02, that is this current, plus vπ2 rπ2, that is this current, plus vπ2 r01, that is this current. because here the voltage drop across this r01 is also equal to vπ2. so all these currents are the incoming current, while the gm1 vπ1 is the outgoing current. so further if we simplify it then we can write it as this gm1 vπ1 vπ2 gm2 1ro2 1ro1 1 rπ2 so here we know that this rπ2 β2 gm2. so, naturally this 1 rπ2 gm2 β2. and definitely it will be less than the gm2. so we can say that this gm2 is much greater than 1 rπ2. and similarly this gm2 will also be much greater than 1ro1 and 1r02. that means here we can neglect these three terms. and by neglecting these three terms we can write it as gm1 vπ1 that is equal to gm2 vπ2. and lets say this is the equation number 2. so now using the equation number 1 and 2, let us find the ratio of the iovin. so we know that this io gm2 vπ2 vπ2 r02. so here lets take this vπ2 common, so if we take it out then further we can write it as, gm2 1ro2. so once again over here this gm2 1ro2. and hence we can say that this io gm2vπ2. and earlier we have seen that this gm1vπ1 is approximately equal to gm2 vπ2. so from this we can say that this io gm1 vπ1. and here as you know this vπ1 is nothing but the vi. so we can say that this io gm1vi. and from this we can say that this io vi is equal to gm1. that means the overall transconductance of this cascode amplifier is approximately equal to gm1. so now the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier is equal to gm r0. where the gm is the transconductance of cascode amplifier and ro is the output impedance of the cascode stage. so as we have see, this gm gm1, and earlier we have seen that, this ro gm2 ro2 r01 rπ2 so here for a moment if we assume that this gm1 gm2 and ro1 ro2, then this voltage gain can be given as this gmr0gm ro rπ so typically the value of this parallel combination will always be less than the rπ. but for a moment lets assume that this r0 is much greater than rπ, in that case this ro rπ is approximately equal to rπ. so the maximum value of the voltage gain will be equal to this gmrox gm rπ. and as you know this gm rπ is nothing but the β. because we know that this rπ β gm. so from this we can say that the maximum value of the voltage gain is equal to βgmro. where gmro is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter stage. so, we can say that, the maximum value of the voltage gain for the cascode amplifier is equal to β a0. where the a0 is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter stage. so as you can see due to this cascode configuration the gain and the output impedance of the amplifier increases by the factor of β. so if you use the same value of the ro, β and the transconductance gm, which we have used earlier then the magnitude of the voltage gain of this cascode amplifier will be equal to 100 x 0.04 x 50 kω. that is the value of gm and ro. and that is equal to 100 x 2000. so, that is equal to 2 x 105. so, as you can see, using the cascode amplifier, the output impedance and the voltage gain of the amplifier will increase substantially. and if see the actual value of the gain and the output impedance, then that will depend on the load. so, if we use the cascode amplifier with the resistive load, then we wont see any improvement in the voltage gain or the output impedance. because if we use the resistive load, then on the output side, this ro of the cascode amplifier will come in parallel with rc. and now, this voltage gain is equal to gm ro rc so, typically the value of rc is much less than ro. so, due to that we can say that, this voltage gain is equal to gmrc. and that is equal to gm1rc. so, as you can see, it same as the voltage gain of the common emitter amplifier. that means if we use the resistive load with the cascode amplifier, then we will not get any improvement in the voltage gain. so, to utilise the cascode effect we need to use the active load such as the current source. so for a moment, if we assume that, the connected current source is the ideal current source, then its output impedance will be equal to infinite. and in that case, if we see the small-signal equivalent circuit on the output side, then it will look like this. so, in this case, this voltage gain is equal to -gmro, where the ro is the output impedance of this cascode amplifier. that means if we use the ideal current source, then in that case, we can get the maximum voltage gain using the cascode amplifier. but as you know, no current source is ideal and it has some finite output impedance. so, due to that, the actual voltage gain will be lesser. so, for example, if we use the pnp transistor as the current source, then in that case, lets say, its output impedance is equal to ro3. so, in that case, if we see the voltage gain, then this voltage gain is equal to -gmro ro3 or if we just consider the magnitude, then that is equal to gmro ro3 so, typically, this ro is much greater than ro3. that means the output impedance of the cascode stage is much greater than the output impedance of the pnp transistor. and due to that, we can say that, this voltage gain is approximately equal to gmro3. that means. if we use the pnp transistor as the current source, then in that case, the overall voltage gain is approximately equal to gm1ro3. and this gain is almost same as the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier. so, as you can see, still it is less than the maximum gain that can be achieved using the cascode amplifier. that means, if we want to achieve the voltage gain that is close to the maximum achievable gain using the cascode amplifier then we also need to use the cascode current source. so, here the cascode current source is implemented using the two pnp transistors. so, here lets say, the output impedance of this q3 transistor is equal to ro3, while the output impedance of the q4 transistor is equal to ro4. so, here if we see the output impedance from here, then that will be equal to ro4. while if we see the output impedance from this end, then that will be equal to gm3ro3 ro4 rπ3 . that is the output impedance of the pnp cascode current source. so, now what we can do, we can connect this cascode current source to the cascode amplifier. and if we do that, then this is how it will look like. so, here these two transistors represents the cascode current source, while these two transistors shows the cascode amplifier stage. so, now for the ac analysis, all the dc sources in the circuit will act as zero. and now, this cascode current source can be replaced by the equivalent output resistance. so, from this we can say that, the overall voltage gain of this amplifier is equal to gm ron rop . where the ron is equivalent output impedance which is seen through the npn cascode amplifier, while the rop is output impedance of the pnp cascode current source. so, we know that, this ron gm2ro2 ro1 rπ2 and this rop gm3ro3 ro4 rπ3 so, the maximum value of ron is approximately equal to β2ro2. because if this ro1 is much greater than rπ2, then this term is approximately equal to rπ2. and then this gm2 rπ2 β2 so, the maximum value of the ron is equal to β2ro2. and likewise, the maximum value of the rop β3ro3. so, typically ron is more than rop. but for a moment lets assume that, both are equal. that means this ron is same as rop. so, when they are connected in the parallel connection, then the overall output resistance will become half. that means now, if we see the overall voltage gain, then that is equal to gmro2. and we know that, the transconductance of this cascode stage is equal to gm1. so, we can say that, the overall voltage gain will be equal to gm1βro2. and for a moment lets assume that gm of all transistors is also same. so, we can say that, the overall voltage gain is equal to gmroβ2. and we know that this gmro is the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier. so, we can say that this overall voltage gain is equal to βao2. so, that is half of the maximum achievable gain using the cascode amplifier. so for example, if β 100, this gm 0.04, ro 50 kω, then this voltage gain will become 100 x 0.04 x 50 kω 2. and that is equal to 105. so, still it is higher than the intrinsic gain of the common emitter amplifier. so, in this way, using the bjt cascode amplifier along with the cascode current source it is possible to achieve the higher voltage gain. but the only drawback with this configuration is that, as there is a drop across each transistor, so the effective voltage that is available to the common emitter stage will get reduce. and hence, the voltage swing will also be limited. so, if we want to increase the voltage swing again, then we need to apply the higher supply voltage. and effectively, that will increase the power consumption. so, that is the only drawback with this cascode amplifier. but in the applications where we want the higher voltage gain, this configuration is suitable. so, i hope in this video you understood, how using the cascode amplifier

_g9j94XPnpQ,How PLC is different from Microcontroller | PLC vs Microcontroller,2025-05-18 04:29:33+00:00,2025,5,Sunday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel All About Electronics. So we know that the PLCs or the programmable logic controllers are the integral part of any industrial automation and the process control. So in this video, let us understand how they are different from the microcontrollers. So this PLC or the programmable logic controller is the industrial controller which consists of the following modules. So if you see in the heart of it, then it consists of the CPU and the relevant program and the data memories. And apart from that, it consists of the input and the output modules. So through this input module, different sensors and the switches can be integrated with the controller. And through this output module, different actuators can be switched on and off. And of course, to program this PLC, we have a programming device and the HMI. So typically, to program this PLC, we have a computer or the dedicated programming device. And to monitor and control the different process parameters of the PLC, we have the graphical display with the touch screen or the keyboard. So this graphical interface is known as the HMI or the human machine interface. And finally, to power up all these modules of the PLC block, we have the power supply module. So typically in the PLC, all these different blocks are modular. That means depending on the one's need, one can add the required blocks. For example, in some industrial application, if it is required to add more input and output modules, then another IO module can be easily integrated with the existing system. Or if it is required to add some communication modules or some special purpose modules, then they can be easily integrated with the existing system. On the other end, in the microcontrollers, all these different blocks are integrated in the single chip. So once the microcontroller is selected, then typically it is not possible to add the additional features in the same chip or the board. But using the additional chip or the additional shields, it is possible to add some features to the existing board. So for example, in the given microcontroller, if we want to add the additional IO ports, or if we want to add the additional relay module, then using the external shield, it is possible to do that. But for that, we need to do the additional wiring with the existing microcontroller chip or the microcontroller board. While in case of the PLC, it can be done very easily. The second aspect if you see, then the PLCs are designed for the harsh environment because mainly they are used in the industrial automation and the control systems. So therefore, they are quite rugged and they can withstand the shock, dust and the humidity without compromising the performance. Moreover, their operating temperature range is also typically higher compared to the normal microcontroller boards. Not only that, the inputs and outputs of these PLCs are also opto-isolated. So because of this galvanic isolation, they can withstand the higher current and the voltage surges during the operation. And moreover, they also have the EMI and the surge protection circuit for the additional safety. Not only that, all the commercially available PLCs also provide the different safety certifications for the industrial usage. Like the electrical safety, EMI and the EMC compliance certificates and the functional safety certificates. And this certification indicates that it can provide the guaranteed performance during the harsh environment. On the other hand, the microcontrollers are mainly used in the embedded systems, consumer applications and the prototyping projects. And therefore, they do not provide any safety certificates. So therefore, they do not provide any safety certificates and they do not guarantee the same reliable performance as the PLC under the harsh environment. So in some applications, if it is required to use such microcontrollers in the harsh environment, then the separate care must be taken and the additional circuit should be integrated with the existing microcontroller boards. So as I said, the PLCs are complying with the different safety standards. That means they have the built-in redundancy and the fault tolerance. And to implement that, they have the different watchdog timers, redundant CPUs and the power supplies. And not only that, these PLCs also perform the different error checking on the IO modules. On the other hand, the microcontrollers do not have such redundancy. So of course, they do have the watchdog timers, but they do not have the built-in failover mechanism. So let me explain what do I mean to say. So in the microcontrollers, what does this watchdog timer do? They used to communicate with the MCU at the fixed interval. And if the MCU does not output the signal after the specific interval, then the watchdog timer determines that the MCU is malfunctioning. And in that case, it sends the reset signal to the MCU. So most of the time, when the MCU gets reset, then it starts working normally. But in case of the major failure, it is quite possible that even after resetting the MCU, it will not work properly. So in case of the PLC, in such scenario, there is a backup CPU. So in case of the failure of the main CPU, the backup CPU takes the charge and starts operating the system. But in case of the microcontroller, we do not have the backup microcontroller. So because of the lack of the redundancy in case of the microcontroller, we do not have the failover mechanism. On the other hand, many PLCs also comply with the SIL standards. And under these standards, they can detect the faults, execute safe states and maintains the certified operation during the partial failure. While if you see the microcontrollers, then typically they do not comply with the SIL standards. Now as the PLCs are intended to be used in the industrial environment, so the real-time performance and the safety compliance is very much required. Because if PLCs fail to respond to the event within the specific time, then it can cause the damage in the plant or it can be a very risky for the human safety. So typically, these PLCs provide the guaranteed real-time performance. And for that, these PLCs have the deterministic scan cycle. So if you see the one read cycle or the one scan cycle of the PLC, then it consists of the following steps. That is reading the inputs, executing the programmable logic and then diagnostic the hardware for the proper functioning. And after that, based on the input, it writes the output on the output module. So this one read cycle or the one scan cycle consists of these four operations. So for the guaranteed real-time performance in the PLCs, this one scan cycle gets completed in the fixed interval. So depending on the PLC module, typically the scan cycle gets completed in the hundreds of microsecond Or for the slower PLCs, it can get completed in the few milliseconds. But the point is for the given PLC, we have the deterministic scan cycle. So we know that the PLC will certainly respond to the change in the input after this finite time interval. And accordingly, the process parameters in the plant can be tuned. So that is the advantage of the PLC. So of course, if you see the current generation microcontrollers, then they can also scan the inputs and update the outputs in the same order of microseconds to the millisecond. But for that, these microcontrollers must be carefully programmed to get this deterministic scan cycle. But in case of the PLC, that is the inherent feature. Now, if you see the another major difference between the PLCs and the microcontroller, then that is the operating voltage and the voltage range of the IO modules. So typically, these MCUs or the microcontrollers are compatible with the TTL and the CMOS logic levels. And therefore, they operate with either 3.3 volt or the 5 volt. And some current generation microcontrollers can operate even at the lesser voltages. And correspondingly in the microcontrollers, the voltage range for the input and output pins is also typically between the 3.3 and the 5 volt. On the other hand, as the PLCs are meant to be used with the industry compliant sensors, so they support the wider range. So these PLCs operates on the standard 24 DC voltage, which is quite common in the industry. But there are many PLCs which also supports the AC voltage. So in such case, they have the built-in power supply module which converts the AC voltage to the DC voltage and generates the 24 volt for the other modules. So similar to the microcontroller, these PLCs also supports the analog input. But here, apart from the voltage input, they also accepts the current input. So if you see the input voltage range, then generally it is from 0 to 10 volt. While if you see the input current range, then it varies from 4 to 20 milliampere. And using this, it is possible to interface many industrial sensors, like the temperature sensor, level transmitter and the flow meter. So similarly, it also accepts the digital input. And if you see the digital input range, then it varies from the 0 to 24 volt. That means the logic low corresponds to 0 volt, while the logic high corresponds to 24 volt. And using these inputs, it is possible to connect the different switches to the PLC, such as the push button, limit switch, flow switch and the pressure switch. So for example, the flow switch will get activated and will provide the 24 volt output when the flow of liquid exceeds the set value. Likewise, the pressure switch will get activated when the pressure in the vessel exceeds the set value. And accordingly, the PLC can take the action. So that is the digital input. Similarly, it also has the analog outputs. But here, it can provide both voltage and the current outputs. So the voltage output range is from 0 to 10 volt, while the current output varies from 4 milliampere to 20 milliampere. And these outputs are useful for driving the variable frequency drive or controlling the process parameters. For example, the analog output of the PLC can drive the VFD and then this variable frequency drive can control the speed of the AC motor. So in this way, these PLCs also supports the analog outputs. And finally, it also supports the various types of digital output. So typically, the digital outputs of the PLC are the relay output. And using which, it is possible to turn on and off different alarms and the indicators. But apart from that, it also supports the transistor outputs for the fast switching. And some PLCs also has the triac outputs for the fast switching of the AC loads. So in short, the voltage range of the PLC inputs and outputs is totally different from the microcontrollers. Then if you see the another difference between them, then that is how they are programmed. So typically, if you see the microcontrollers, then they are programmed in C, C++ or the assembly language. And nowadays, many MCUs can also be programmed in the Python. So this programming can be done in the different development environments. So these are the common development environments which are typically used for the programming these microcontrollers. So of course, there are many other vendor specific development environments. But using this environment, it is possible to program the MCUs. On the other hand, this PLC programming has been standardized by the following standard. And this standard defines the five common programming languages for the PLC. The first one is the ladder logic, which is most commonly used for the PLC programming. Then if you see the second language, then that is the functional block diagram. Then after, if you see the third programming language, then that is the structured text, which is very similar to the high level text based programming like the C language. Then after, if you see the fourth programming language, then that is the instruction list. So this programming language is a low level text based language and it is similar to the assembly programming. And then after, the fifth one is the SFC. So as per this IEC standard, these five programming languages are supported by the PLCs. So if you see the development environment for programming this PLC, then that is the vendor specific. But since the PLCs are meant to be used in the industry, so these development environments also have the built-in diagnostic tools. So as you can see, from the programming perspective also, the PLCs and the microcontrollers are programmed differently. Now, the another aspect in which they are different is the scalability. So typically, the PLCs are easily scalable. So because of their modular design, first, it is easy to attach different modules. And even if we want to connect multiple PLCs together, then it can be easily done by connecting these different PLCs together in the network via the LAN cable. So in case of the microcontrollers also, using some wired or the wireless protocols, it is possible to connect multiple MCUs together. But for that, first the microcontroller unit should support these protocols. So nowadays, most of the microcontroller units supports the given wired protocols. But for that, we need to do the additional wiring and we also need to do the additional coding to connect them together. And if they also support the wireless protocols like the Bluetooth or the Wi-Fi, then it is also possible to connect the multiple MCUs together in the network. But the thing is the scalability in case of the PLC is wider compared to the MCUs. Then if you see the another major difference between them, then that is the cost. So the microcontrollers are very low cost. So they are easily available in the market and their development environment is also free. On the other hand, if you see the PLCs, then they have very large initial cost. The reason is that they are quite rugged and they are designed for the industrial environment. Not only that, they are also meant to be used for the longer duration. So typically, once the PLCs are installed, then they tend to operate for 10 to 15 years without much maintenance. And typically, the vendors also provide the good support for the same PLC. So that is why the initial cost of the PLC is higher. And lastly, let's compare them with respect to the processing power. So inside the PLC also if you see, then there is a microcontroller. But as we have seen, they are optimized for the logical operation and the scan based execution. Because in the industry, they are meant to be provide the reliable operation. So typically, the scan cycle duration varies from hundreds of microsecond to the few milliseconds. That means mainly, they are not designed for the intensive computation. While in case of the microcontrollers if you see, then we have the wide range of microcontrollers starting from the 8-bit to the 32-bits. Using this, it is possible to perform the complex algorithms very efficiently. So if we compare both the PLCs and the controllers in terms of the raw processing power, then the microcontrollers can perform very complex task. But they cannot provide the same reliability as the PLCs. So in summary, the PLCs are meant to be used for the industrial usage. And as they are meant for that, so they are quite rugged and the robust. Not only that, they can also withstand very harsh environment and they also complies with different safety standards. Not only that, their operating voltage range is also industry compliant and they are designed to accommodate wide range of industry sensors. On the other hand, the microcontrollers are very low cost and they are meant to be used in the embedded systems, consumer applications and for the prototyping. And as we have seen, they operates with the low voltages like the 3.3 volt and the 5 volt. But in case of the microcontrollers, we have the additional flexibility. That means by building the additional circuit around it, it is possible to use them in the different applications.

understand how they are different from the microcontrollers. so this plc or the programmable logic controller is the industrial controller which consists of the following modules. so if you see in the heart of it, then it consists of the cpu and the relevant program and the data memories. and apart from that, it consists of the input and the output modules. so through this input module, different sensors and the switches can be integrated with the controller. and through this output module, different actuators can be switched on and off. and of course, to program this plc, we have a programming device and the hmi. so typically, to program this plc, we have a computer or the dedicated programming device. and to monitor and control the different process parameters of the plc, we have the graphical display with the touch screen or the keyboard. so this graphical interface is known as the hmi or the human machine interface. and finally, to power up all these modules of the plc block, we have the power supply module. so typically in the plc, all these different blocks are modular. that means depending on the ones need, one can add the required blocks. for example, in some industrial application, if it is required to add more input and output modules, then another io module can be easily integrated with the existing system. or if it is required to add some communication modules or some special purpose modules, then they can be easily integrated with the existing system. on the other end, in the microcontrollers, all these different blocks are integrated in the single chip. so once the microcontroller is selected, then typically it is not possible to add the additional features in the same chip or the board. but using the additional chip or the additional shields, it is possible to add some features to the existing board. so for example, in the given microcontroller, if we want to add the additional io ports, or if we want to add the additional relay module, then using the external shield, it is possible to do that. but for that, we need to do the additional wiring with the existing microcontroller chip or the microcontroller board. while in case of the plc, it can be done very easily. the second aspect if you see, then the plcs are designed for the harsh environment because mainly they are used in the industrial automation and the control systems. so therefore, they are quite rugged and they can withstand the shock, dust and the humidity without compromising the performance. moreover, their operating temperature range is also typically higher compared to the normal microcontroller boards. not only that, the inputs and outputs of these plcs are also opto-isolated. so because of this galvanic isolation, they can withstand the higher current and the voltage surges during the operation. and moreover, they also have the emi and the surge protection circuit for the additional safety. not only that, all the commercially available plcs also provide the different safety certifications for the industrial usage. like the electrical safety, emi and the emc compliance certificates and the functional safety certificates. and this certification indicates that it can provide the guaranteed performance during the harsh environment. on the other hand, the microcontrollers are mainly used in the embedded systems, consumer applications and the prototyping projects. and therefore, they do not provide any safety certificates. so therefore, they do not provide any safety certificates and they do not guarantee the same reliable performance as the plc under the harsh environment. so in some applications, if it is required to use such microcontrollers in the harsh environment, then the separate care must be taken and the additional circuit should be integrated with the existing microcontroller boards. so as i said, the plcs are complying with the different safety standards. that means they have the built-in redundancy and the fault tolerance. and to implement that, they have the different watchdog timers, redundant cpus and the power supplies. and not only that, these plcs also perform the different error checking on the io modules. on the other hand, the microcontrollers do not have such redundancy. so of course, they do have the watchdog timers, but they do not have the built-in failover mechanism. so let me explain what do i mean to say. so in the microcontrollers, what does this watchdog timer do? they used to communicate with the mcu at the fixed interval. and if the mcu does not output the signal after the specific interval, then the watchdog timer determines that the mcu is malfunctioning. and in that case, it sends the reset signal to the mcu. so most of the time, when the mcu gets reset, then it starts working normally. but in case of the major failure, it is quite possible that even after resetting the mcu, it will not work properly. so in case of the plc, in such scenario, there is a backup cpu. so in case of the failure of the main cpu, the backup cpu takes the charge and starts operating the system. but in case of the microcontroller, we do not have the backup microcontroller. so because of the lack of the redundancy in case of the microcontroller, we do not have the failover mechanism. on the other hand, many plcs also comply with the sil standards. and under these standards, they can detect the faults, execute safe states and maintains the certified operation during the partial failure. while if you see the microcontrollers, then typically they do not comply with the sil standards. now as the plcs are intended to be used in the industrial environment, so the real-time performance and the safety compliance is very much required. because if plcs fail to respond to the event within the specific time, then it can cause the damage in the plant or it can be a very risky for the human safety. so typically, these plcs provide the guaranteed real-time performance. and for that, these plcs have the deterministic scan cycle. so if you see the one read cycle or the one scan cycle of the plc, then it consists of the following steps. that is reading the inputs, executing the programmable logic and then diagnostic the hardware for the proper functioning. and after that, based on the input, it writes the output on the output module. so this one read cycle or the one scan cycle consists of these four operations. so for the guaranteed real-time performance in the plcs, this one scan cycle gets completed in the fixed interval. so depending on the plc module, typically the scan cycle gets completed in the hundreds of microsecond or for the slower plcs, it can get completed in the few milliseconds. but the point is for the given plc, we have the deterministic scan cycle. so we know that the plc will certainly respond to the change in the input after this finite time interval. and accordingly, the process parameters in the plant can be tuned. so that is the advantage of the plc. so of course, if you see the current generation microcontrollers, then they can also scan the inputs and update the outputs in the same order of microseconds to the millisecond. but for that, these microcontrollers must be carefully programmed to get this deterministic scan cycle. but in case of the plc, that is the inherent feature. now, if you see the another major difference between the plcs and the microcontroller, then that is the operating voltage and the voltage range of the io modules. so typically, these mcus or the microcontrollers are compatible with the ttl and the cmos logic levels. and therefore, they operate with either 3.3 volt or the 5 volt. and some current generation microcontrollers can operate even at the lesser voltages. and correspondingly in the microcontrollers, the voltage range for the input and output pins is also typically between the 3.3 and the 5 volt. on the other hand, as the plcs are meant to be used with the industry compliant sensors, so they support the wider range. so these plcs operates on the standard 24 dc voltage, which is quite common in the industry. but there are many plcs which also supports the ac voltage. so in such case, they have the built-in power supply module which converts the ac voltage to the dc voltage and generates the 24 volt for the other modules. so similar to the microcontroller, these plcs also supports the analog input. but here, apart from the voltage input, they also accepts the current input. so if you see the input voltage range, then generally it is from 0 to 10 volt. while if you see the input current range, then it varies from 4 to 20 milliampere. and using this, it is possible to interface many industrial sensors, like the temperature sensor, level transmitter and the flow meter. so similarly, it also accepts the digital input. and if you see the digital input range, then it varies from the 0 to 24 volt. that means the logic low corresponds to 0 volt, while the logic high corresponds to 24 volt. and using these inputs, it is possible to connect the different switches to the plc, such as the push button, limit switch, flow switch and the pressure switch. so for example, the flow switch will get activated and will provide the 24 volt output when the flow of liquid exceeds the set value. likewise, the pressure switch will get activated when the pressure in the vessel exceeds the set value. and accordingly, the plc can take the action. so that is the digital input. similarly, it also has the analog outputs. but here, it can provide both voltage and the current outputs. so the voltage output range is from 0 to 10 volt, while the current output varies from 4 milliampere to 20 milliampere. and these outputs are useful for driving the variable frequency drive or controlling the process parameters. for example, the analog output of the plc can drive the vfd and then this variable frequency drive can control the speed of the ac motor. so in this way, these plcs also supports the analog outputs. and finally, it also supports the various types of digital output. so typically, the digital outputs of the plc are the relay output. and using which, it is possible to turn on and off different alarms and the indicators. but apart from that, it also supports the transistor outputs for the fast switching. and some plcs also has the triac outputs for the fast switching of the ac loads. so in short, the voltage range of the plc inputs and outputs is totally different from the microcontrollers. then if you see the another difference between them, then that is how they are programmed. so typically, if you see the microcontrollers, then they are programmed in c, c or the assembly language. and nowadays, many mcus can also be programmed in the python. so this programming can be done in the different development environments. so these are the common development environments which are typically used for the programming these microcontrollers. so of course, there are many other vendor specific development environments. but using this environment, it is possible to program the mcus. on the other hand, this plc programming has been standardized by the following standard. and this standard defines the five common programming languages for the plc. the first one is the ladder logic, which is most commonly used for the plc programming. then if you see the second language, then that is the functional block diagram. then after, if you see the third programming language, then that is the structured text, which is very similar to the high level text based programming like the c language. then after, if you see the fourth programming language, then that is the instruction list. so this programming language is a low level text based language and it is similar to the assembly programming. and then after, the fifth one is the sfc. so as per this iec standard, these five programming languages are supported by the plcs. so if you see the development environment for programming this plc, then that is the vendor specific. but since the plcs are meant to be used in the industry, so these development environments also have the built-in diagnostic tools. so as you can see, from the programming perspective also, the plcs and the microcontrollers are programmed differently. now, the another aspect in which they are different is the scalability. so typically, the plcs are easily scalable. so because of their modular design, first, it is easy to attach different modules. and even if we want to connect multiple plcs together, then it can be easily done by connecting these different plcs together in the network via the lan cable. so in case of the microcontrollers also, using some wired or the wireless protocols, it is possible to connect multiple mcus together. but for that, first the microcontroller unit should support these protocols. so nowadays, most of the microcontroller units supports the given wired protocols. but for that, we need to do the additional wiring and we also need to do the additional coding to connect them together. and if they also support the wireless protocols like the bluetooth or the wi-fi, then it is also possible to connect the multiple mcus together in the network. but the thing is the scalability in case of the plc is wider compared to the mcus. then if you see the another major difference between them, then that is the cost. so the microcontrollers are very low cost. so they are easily available in the market and their development environment is also free. on the other hand, if you see the plcs, then they have very large initial cost. the reason is that they are quite rugged and they are designed for the industrial environment. not only that, they are also meant to be used for the longer duration. so typically, once the plcs are installed, then they tend to operate for 10 to 15 years without much maintenance. and typically, the vendors also provide the good support for the same plc. so that is why the initial cost of the plc is higher. and lastly, lets compare them with respect to the processing power. so inside the plc also if you see, then there is a microcontroller. but as we have seen, they are optimized for the logical operation and the scan based execution. because in the industry, they are meant to be provide the reliable operation. so typically, the scan cycle duration varies from hundreds of microsecond to the few milliseconds. that means mainly, they are not designed for the intensive computation. while in case of the microcontrollers if you see, then we have the wide range of microcontrollers starting from the 8-bit to the 32-bits. using this, it is possible to perform the complex algorithms very efficiently. so if we compare both the plcs and the controllers in terms of the raw processing power, then the microcontrollers can perform very complex task. but they cannot provide the same reliability as the plcs. so in summary, the plcs are meant to be used for the industrial usage. and as they are meant for that, so they are quite rugged and the robust. not only that, they can also withstand very harsh environment and they also complies with different safety standards. not only that, their operating voltage range is also industry compliant and they are designed to accommodate wide range of industry sensors. on the other hand, the microcontrollers are very low cost and they are meant to be used in the embedded systems, consumer applications and for the prototyping. and as we have seen, they operates with the low voltages like the 3.3 volt and the 5 volt. but in case of the microcontrollers, we have the additional flexibility. that means by building the additional circuit around it, it is possible to use them in the different applications. so i hope through this video, you understood the basic difference between the plc and the microcontrollers. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to

8OGncimlICw,What is Sample and Hold ?  Sample and Hold Explained,2025-04-28 19:08:16+00:00,2025,4,Monday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the Sample and Hold circuit. So in this video, we will see the basic circuit of the Sample and Hold. And then after, we will also understand the different specifications of the Sample and Hold. So, if we know these specifications, then we can easily choose the proper  Sample and Hold circuit for the specific application. Alright, so we know that this Sample and Hold is a very integral part  of any analog to digital conversion. So, in the earlier videos of the ADC, we have seen that for the analog to digital conversion, first the analog signal is sampled at the fixed intervals using this Sample and Hold circuit. So, this sampled signal is then given to the ADC, and this ADC then performs the quantization. And based on the quantization, this ADC encodes each sample in the digital form. That means the first step in any analog to digital conversion is the sampling. And this sampling is performed using the Sample and Hold circuit. So this Sample and Hold circuit has the two inputs. One is the analog input, where the analog signal is applied. And the second one is the control input, where the Sample and Hold commands are given. So when the Sample command is given,  then the Sample and Hold circuit samples the input signal. Or we can say that it is tracking the input signal. And whenever the Hold command is given, then it holds the last sample value of the  analog signal during the tracking. So as you can see in this picture, the train of Sample and Hold commands are given  to the Sample and Hold circuit. So as you can see, when the Sample command is given, at that time,  it is tracing the input signal. And as soon as we provide the Hold command, then it is holding the last sample value. So during this Hold period, where the input remains flat, during that period, the ADC can perform the analog to digital conversion. So for the ideal Sample and Hold circuit, if we apply the sine wave as an input, and at the same time, if we also apply the Sample and Hold commands as shown in the figure, then this is how the output will look like. That means this is the output of the Sample and Hold circuit. So now, let's see the basic components of the Sample and Hold circuit. So the two key components of the Sample and Hold circuits are  the switch and the Hold capacitor. So whenever the Sample command is given to the switch,  then the switch remains in the closed condition. And at that time, this Hold capacitor follows the input signal. And ideally, the voltage across the capacitor should be same as the input signal. And now, when the Hold command is given, then the switch gets opened. And now, this Hold capacitor holds the last sample value during the tracking period. And during this Hold period, the ADC can perform the analog to digital conversion. So this switch operation can be implemented either using the BJT, JFET or the MOSFETs. But nowadays, mostly the MOSFET-based switches are commonly used. So that is the basic working principle of the Sample and Hold circuit. So now, if we just use this simple circuit, then we might face the issue  both on the input as well as the output side. For example, on the input side, how fast this Hold capacitor is able to track the input signal, that depends on the value of the Hold capacitor  as well as the source impedance of the input signal. So basically, that depends on the RC time constant of the charging circuit. And with the fixed value of the Hold capacitor, that depends on the  source impedance of the input signal. So for some input, if the source impedance is higher,  then the RC time constant will increase. And in that case, during the sample mode, this Hold capacitor will not be able to track the input signal properly. That means in this case, how well the Sample and Hold is able to track the input signal, that depends on the source impedance of the input signal. Similarly, during the Hold period, how well this capacitor is able to hold the charge, that depends on the value of this load resistance. Because during the Hold period, the charge across the capacitor  will discharge through this path. So typically, here the load will be the input impedance of the ADC. And if that is not very high, then we might see the faster discharge of the capacitor. So ideally, the voltage across the Hold capacitor should remain constant during the Hold period. But because of the faster discharging of this capacitor, we will see the drop  in the voltage across the capacitor. And this phenomenon is known as the droop. So we will discuss this phenomenon later on. But here, the thing is that this load impedance can affect the voltage  across the capacitor during the Hold period. So to remove that dependency, both on the input as well as the output side, typically, the input and output buffers are used. So as you can see, this input buffer is connected just before the switch, while the output buffer is connected after this Hold capacitor. And we know that the op-amp can be used as the buffer. So these buffers provide the high input impedance as well as the low output impedance. So on the input side, first, because of this buffer, there is no dependency  on the source impedance. And the second thing is, since the output impedance of this buffer is very low, so now this RC time constant during the sampling mode will be very low. Similarly, on the output side, because of this buffer,  there is no dependency on the load resistance. And the second thing is, since the input impedance of the op-amp is very high,  so it will hold the charge across the Hold capacitor for the longer time. So that is the typical circuit of the Sample and Hold. And this architecture, which is shown over here is the open-loop architecture. Because here, there is no feedback from the output to the input side. But similarly, some Sample and Hold circuits also use the closed-loop architecture. But here in this video, we will not discuss about the closed-loop architecture. So now, let's see some of the basic specifications of the Sample and Hold circuit. So by knowing these specifications and the meaning of it, we can choose  the right Sample and Hold for the specific application. So typically, the Sample and Hold specifications are categorized in the four parts. The first is when the circuit is in the Sample mode and  the second is during the Sample to Hold mode transition. Similarly, the third type of specifications are defined for the Hold period. And similarly, some specifications are defined for the Hold to Sample mode transitions. So first, let's see the Sample mode specifications. So one of the specifications for the Sample mode is the offset voltage. So typically, in this Sample and Hold, during the Sample mode,  the output should follow the input signal, right? That means ideally, the output of this buffer should be same as the input signal. But sometimes, due to the offset errors of the op-amp, in the output,  we might see some DC offset. So typically, it is mentioned in the specifications. The second one is the gain error. So like I said, during the Sample mode, this Sample and Hold should track the input signal. So if we see the input-output transfer characteristic, then ideally, it should look like this. But sometimes, we might have a gain error. That means this Vout is k times the input signal,  where this k can be greater than or less than 1. So this is another probable error during the sampling. The third one is the slew rate. So it shows that how fast the output of the Sample and Hold can change. And typically, it is mentioned in the volt per microsecond. So this specification tells us that up to what frequency and what input range,  the Sample and Hold is able to track the input signal correctly. And similarly, another specification that is mentioned during the Sample mode is the bandwidth. That is the bandwidth of the Sample and Hold circuit. So this specification also shows us the maximum signal frequency,  which can be supported and tracked by the Sample and Hold circuit. But the only difference between this and the earlier specification is that, this specification is defined for the small signals. That means this specification is useful for the input signal, whose amplitude is very small. While the earlier specification or the slew rate is useful when we have a large voltage swing in the input signal. So of course, the slew rate defined bandwidth will always be lesser  than this small signal bandwidth. But these two specifications tell us the maximum frequency,  which can be tracked by this Sample and Hold circuit. And accordingly, we can choose the right Sample and Hold for the specific application. So these are the Sample mode specifications. So now, similarly, let's see the specifications,  which are defined for the Sample to Hold mode transition. So of course, when we apply the Hold command, then the Sample and Hold circuit will  take some finite time to go from the Sample mode to the Hold mode. So these specifications are defined for the period when the Sample and Hold circuit is transitioning from the Sample mode to the Hold mode. So there are a couple of specifications and one of them is the Aperture time. So it shows the time between the application of the Hold command and when the input signal gets actually disconnected from the Hold capacitor. So ideally, when we apply the Hold command, then immediately, this switch should get open and this input signal should get disconnected from the Hold capacitor. But in reality, this switch takes some finite time for the opening. So this duration is referred as the Aperture time. Then if we see the next important specification, then that is the Hold mode settling time. So it shows the time required for the output to settle within the specified error band once the Hold command is given. That means once we apply the Hold signal, then there will be a transient in the output before it gets settled to the intended value. So this time that is taken by the output to get settled in a specified error band is  known as the Hold mode settling time. And generally, this error band is specified as the 1% or 0.1% or sometimes the  half LSB of the full-scale voltage. That means once we apply the Hold command, then after the settling time only,  the output of this Sample and hold will be stable. And after this time only, the ADC should start performing the conversion. So this specification is one of the important specifications for the ADC. And once again, we will talk about it at the later part of the video. So then after, another important specification is the Hold step or the pedestal error. So this specification shows the additional voltage step that appears at the output due to this sample-to-hold transition. So basically, when the Hold command is given and when the switch gets opened  at that time, there is a charge injection from the switch to the Hold capacitor. And because of this charge transfer, we will see some additional voltage at the output on top of the desired voltage. So this additional offset voltage at the output is known as the Hold step. And this error is also known as the pedestal error. So for example, in this case, ideally, once the Hold command is given, then this Hold capacitor should reach to this voltage. But here, because of the charge injection during the switching, we are getting this additional voltage. So this voltage is known as the Hold step. So this Hold step voltage can be given as Q divided by CH, where the Q is the amount of charge that is injected into the Hold capacitor, and the CH is the value of this Hold capacitor. So as you can see, if we choose the larger value of the Hold capacitor, then this Hold step will be lesser. But at the same time, now the sample and hold will not be  able to track the input signal faster. So there is always a trade-off, and one should select the value of this Hold capacitor based on the application. So we have seen that the one way of reducing the Hold step is  by increasing the value of the Hold capacitor. But apart from that, there is another way also, we can also reduce the Hold step. So in this technique, typically a CMOS based transmission gate is used as a switch. Because we know that the CMOS switch consists of both NMOS as well as the PMOS transistors. So because of that, the effect of the charge injection will get nullified, or at least it is possible to minimize that effect. So in this way, by using these different techniques, it is possible to minimize this pedestal error. So these are the specifications for the sample to hold mode transition. So similarly, now let's see the hold mode specifications. So these are the specifications where the switch is completely open  and the hold capacitor is disconnected from the input side. So one such specification is the droop rate. And as we have seen earlier, it is the rate at which the output voltage is changing due to the leakage from the hold capacitor. So ideally during the hold period, after this hold mode settling time, the output across the capacitor should remain constant. But in reality, due to the leakage through the hold capacitor, we are seeing the change in this hold voltage. And this change in the voltage is known as the droop. And the rate at which this voltage is changing is known as the droop rate. So this leakage current through the hold capacitor consists of the three parts. The one reason is through the leakage through this hold capacitor. The second reason for this leakage current is the leakage through this analog switch. And the third reason is the input bias current of this output amplifier. So it is quite possible that the polarity of these currents may not be the same. But let's say the overall leakage current is equal to IL. So this current can be given as CH times dVH divided by dT, where the CH is the capacitance of this hold capacitor and this VH is the voltage across the hold capacitor. So this droop rate or this dVH divided by dt is equal to IL divided by CH. So as you can see, as we increase the value of this hold capacitor,  then this droop rate will reduce. So while selecting the value of this hold capacitor, we should ensure that during the conversion time of the ADC or during this hold period, the change in the hold voltage should not be more than half LSB. And by ensuring that, we can get the desired accuracy during the conversion. Then if we see the next hold mode specification,  then that is the feed-through attenuation ratio. So it shows the fraction of the input signal that appears at the output during the hold mode. And typically, it is expressed in the dB. So basically, it shows the ability of the circuit to block the input signal when the circuit is in the hold mode. So ideally during the hold period, when the switch gets opened, then there should not be any connection between the input and the output, right? But many times, the parasitic capacitance exists between the input and the output side. And through this parasitic capacitance, there is a weak coupling of the input signal to the output side. And because of that, some fraction of the input signal is appearing at the output. So this parameter is typically defined at the specific frequency. And again, the value of this parameter should be less than the  half LSB of the full-scale input voltage, so that it will not affect the accuracy of the conversion.  So these are the hold mode specifications. So now finally, let's see the specification which is defined for the hold mode to the sample mode transition. That means when the sample and hold circuit is going from the hold mode to the sample mode. So one such important specification is the acquisition time. So it shows the maximum time that is required to acquire the new input voltage once  the sample command is given. So we know that once the hold command is given, then the sample and hold circuit  try to keep the output voltage constant to the last sample value. Now during this hold period, if we see the input signal, then it is still changing, right? But here, the sample and hold circuit is not tracking it. But once we apply the sample signal again, then it starts tracking the input signal again. So ideally, it should reach to the input immediately. But in reality, it will take some finite time to reach to this new input level. So once the output of the sample and hold reaches within the specified error band  around the input signal, then we can say that the signal is acquired. That means this time required by the sample and hold to reach there within the  specified error band is known as this acquisition time. And obviously, the maximum acquisition time will occur when the hold capacitor  needs to charge to the full-scale voltage range. So let's say, the full-scale voltage range for the some sample and hold is from  -2V to +2V  So for example, if the hold capacitor needs to go from the minus two volt to the plus two volt, then in that case, we will see the maximum acquisition time. So this acquisition time depends on the value of the hold capacitor. So for the faster acquisition time, the value of the hold capacitor should be small. But by choosing the small value of the hold capacitor, the droop rate will increase. So there is always a trade-off between the speed and the accuracy. And one should select the sample and hold circuit and the value of the hold capacitor according to the application. So these are the different specifications of the sample and hold circuit. Now among these specifications, the two sample and hold specifications are very  important for deciding the maximum sampling frequency. That is the maximum frequency at which the input signal can be sampled. So these two specifications are the acquisition time and the hold mode settling time. So these two times show the maximum time that is required by the sample and hold  during the sampling and the holding period. And on top of that, we also have this ADC conversion time. So these three times show the minimum time that is required by the sample and hold  circuit and the ADC to complete the one conversion. And if we see the maximum sampling frequency, then that is the inverse of that. So in this way, if we know the different specifications of the sample and hold,  then we can easily choose the right sample and hold for the specific application. So I hope in this video, you understood the basic circuit of the sample and hold. And I hope you also understood what are the different important specifications of the sample and hold. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",what is sample and hold ? sample and hold explained,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the sample and hold circuit. so in this video, we will see the basic circuit of the sample and hold. and then after, we will also understand the different specifications of the sample and hold. so, if we know these specifications, then we can easily choose the proper sample and hold circuit for the specific application. alright, so we know that this sample and hold is a very integral part of any analog to digital conversion. so, in the earlier videos of the adc, we have seen that for the analog to digital conversion, first the analog signal is sampled at the fixed intervals using this sample and hold circuit. so, this sampled signal is then given to the adc, and this adc then performs the quantization. and based on the quantization, this adc encodes each sample in the digital form. that means the first step in any analog to digital conversion is the sampling. and this sampling is performed using the sample and hold circuit. so this sample and hold circuit has the two inputs. one is the analog input, where the analog signal is applied. and the second one is the control input, where the sample and hold commands are given. so when the sample command is given, then the sample and hold circuit samples the input signal. or we can say that it is tracking the input signal. and whenever the hold command is given, then it holds the last sample value of the analog signal during the tracking. so as you can see in this picture, the train of sample and hold commands are given to the sample and hold circuit. so as you can see, when the sample command is given, at that time, it is tracing the input signal. and as soon as we provide the hold command, then it is holding the last sample value. so during this hold period, where the input remains flat, during that period, the adc can perform the analog to digital conversion. so for the ideal sample and hold circuit, if we apply the sine wave as an input, and at the same time, if we also apply the sample and hold commands as shown in the figure, then this is how the output will look like. that means this is the output of the sample and hold circuit. so now, lets see the basic components of the sample and hold circuit. so the two key components of the sample and hold circuits are the switch and the hold capacitor. so whenever the sample command is given to the switch, then the switch remains in the closed condition. and at that time, this hold capacitor follows the input signal. and ideally, the voltage across the capacitor should be same as the input signal. and now, when the hold command is given, then the switch gets opened. and now, this hold capacitor holds the last sample value during the tracking period. and during this hold period, the adc can perform the analog to digital conversion. so this switch operation can be implemented either using the bjt, jfet or the mosfets. but nowadays, mostly the mosfet-based switches are commonly used. so that is the basic working principle of the sample and hold circuit. so now, if we just use this simple circuit, then we might face the issue both on the input as well as the output side. for example, on the input side, how fast this hold capacitor is able to track the input signal, that depends on the value of the hold capacitor as well as the source impedance of the input signal. so basically, that depends on the rc time constant of the charging circuit. and with the fixed value of the hold capacitor, that depends on the source impedance of the input signal. so for some input, if the source impedance is higher, then the rc time constant will increase. and in that case, during the sample mode, this hold capacitor will not be able to track the input signal properly. that means in this case, how well the sample and hold is able to track the input signal, that depends on the source impedance of the input signal. similarly, during the hold period, how well this capacitor is able to hold the charge, that depends on the value of this load resistance. because during the hold period, the charge across the capacitor will discharge through this path. so typically, here the load will be the input impedance of the adc. and if that is not very high, then we might see the faster discharge of the capacitor. so ideally, the voltage across the hold capacitor should remain constant during the hold period. but because of the faster discharging of this capacitor, we will see the drop in the voltage across the capacitor. and this phenomenon is known as the droop. so we will discuss this phenomenon later on. but here, the thing is that this load impedance can affect the voltage across the capacitor during the hold period. so to remove that dependency, both on the input as well as the output side, typically, the input and output buffers are used. so as you can see, this input buffer is connected just before the switch, while the output buffer is connected after this hold capacitor. and we know that the op-amp can be used as the buffer. so these buffers provide the high input impedance as well as the low output impedance. so on the input side, first, because of this buffer, there is no dependency on the source impedance. and the second thing is, since the output impedance of this buffer is very low, so now this rc time constant during the sampling mode will be very low. similarly, on the output side, because of this buffer, there is no dependency on the load resistance. and the second thing is, since the input impedance of the op-amp is very high, so it will hold the charge across the hold capacitor for the longer time. so that is the typical circuit of the sample and hold. and this architecture, which is shown over here is the open-loop architecture. because here, there is no feedback from the output to the input side. but similarly, some sample and hold circuits also use the closed-loop architecture. but here in this video, we will not discuss about the closed-loop architecture. so now, lets see some of the basic specifications of the sample and hold circuit. so by knowing these specifications and the meaning of it, we can choose the right sample and hold for the specific application. so typically, the sample and hold specifications are categorized in the four parts. the first is when the circuit is in the sample mode and the second is during the sample to hold mode transition. similarly, the third type of specifications are defined for the hold period. and similarly, some specifications are defined for the hold to sample mode transitions. so first, lets see the sample mode specifications. so one of the specifications for the sample mode is the offset voltage. so typically, in this sample and hold, during the sample mode, the output should follow the input signal, right? that means ideally, the output of this buffer should be same as the input signal. but sometimes, due to the offset errors of the op-amp, in the output, we might see some dc offset. so typically, it is mentioned in the specifications. the second one is the gain error. so like i said, during the sample mode, this sample and hold should track the input signal. so if we see the input-output transfer characteristic, then ideally, it should look like this. but sometimes, we might have a gain error. that means this vout is k times the input signal, where this k can be greater than or less than 1. so this is another probable error during the sampling. the third one is the slew rate. so it shows that how fast the output of the sample and hold can change. and typically, it is mentioned in the volt per microsecond. so this specification tells us that up to what frequency and what input range, the sample and hold is able to track the input signal correctly. and similarly, another specification that is mentioned during the sample mode is the bandwidth. that is the bandwidth of the sample and hold circuit. so this specification also shows us the maximum signal frequency, which can be supported and tracked by the sample and hold circuit. but the only difference between this and the earlier specification is that, this specification is defined for the small signals. that means this specification is useful for the input signal, whose amplitude is very small. while the earlier specification or the slew rate is useful when we have a large voltage swing in the input signal. so of course, the slew rate defined bandwidth will always be lesser than this small signal bandwidth. but these two specifications tell us the maximum frequency, which can be tracked by this sample and hold circuit. and accordingly, we can choose the right sample and hold for the specific application. so these are the sample mode specifications. so now, similarly, lets see the specifications, which are defined for the sample to hold mode transition. so of course, when we apply the hold command, then the sample and hold circuit will take some finite time to go from the sample mode to the hold mode. so these specifications are defined for the period when the sample and hold circuit is transitioning from the sample mode to the hold mode. so there are a couple of specifications and one of them is the aperture time. so it shows the time between the application of the hold command and when the input signal gets actually disconnected from the hold capacitor. so ideally, when we apply the hold command, then immediately, this switch should get open and this input signal should get disconnected from the hold capacitor. but in reality, this switch takes some finite time for the opening. so this duration is referred as the aperture time. then if we see the next important specification, then that is the hold mode settling time. so it shows the time required for the output to settle within the specified error band once the hold command is given. that means once we apply the hold signal, then there will be a transient in the output before it gets settled to the intended value. so this time that is taken by the output to get settled in a specified error band is known as the hold mode settling time. and generally, this error band is specified as the 1 or 0.1 or sometimes the half lsb of the full-scale voltage. that means once we apply the hold command, then after the settling time only, the output of this sample and hold will be stable. and after this time only, the adc should start performing the conversion. so this specification is one of the important specifications for the adc. and once again, we will talk about it at the later part of the video. so then after, another important specification is the hold step or the pedestal error. so this specification shows the additional voltage step that appears at the output due to this sample-to-hold transition. so basically, when the hold command is given and when the switch gets opened at that time, there is a charge injection from the switch to the hold capacitor. and because of this charge transfer, we will see some additional voltage at the output on top of the desired voltage. so this additional offset voltage at the output is known as the hold step. and this error is also known as the pedestal error. so for example, in this case, ideally, once the hold command is given, then this hold capacitor should reach to this voltage. but here, because of the charge injection during the switching, we are getting this additional voltage. so this voltage is known as the hold step. so this hold step voltage can be given as q divided by ch, where the q is the amount of charge that is injected into the hold capacitor, and the ch is the value of this hold capacitor. so as you can see, if we choose the larger value of the hold capacitor, then this hold step will be lesser. but at the same time, now the sample and hold will not be able to track the input signal faster. so there is always a trade-off, and one should select the value of this hold capacitor based on the application. so we have seen that the one way of reducing the hold step is by increasing the value of the hold capacitor. but apart from that, there is another way also, we can also reduce the hold step. so in this technique, typically a cmos based transmission gate is used as a switch. because we know that the cmos switch consists of both nmos as well as the pmos transistors. so because of that, the effect of the charge injection will get nullified, or at least it is possible to minimize that effect. so in this way, by using these different techniques, it is possible to minimize this pedestal error. so these are the specifications for the sample to hold mode transition. so similarly, now lets see the hold mode specifications. so these are the specifications where the switch is completely open and the hold capacitor is disconnected from the input side. so one such specification is the droop rate. and as we have seen earlier, it is the rate at which the output voltage is changing due to the leakage from the hold capacitor. so ideally during the hold period, after this hold mode settling time, the output across the capacitor should remain constant. but in reality, due to the leakage through the hold capacitor, we are seeing the change in this hold voltage. and this change in the voltage is known as the droop. and the rate at which this voltage is changing is known as the droop rate. so this leakage current through the hold capacitor consists of the three parts. the one reason is through the leakage through this hold capacitor. the second reason for this leakage current is the leakage through this analog switch. and the third reason is the input bias current of this output amplifier. so it is quite possible that the polarity of these currents may not be the same. but lets say the overall leakage current is equal to il. so this current can be given as ch times dvh divided by dt, where the ch is the capacitance of this hold capacitor and this vh is the voltage across the hold capacitor. so this droop rate or this dvh divided by dt is equal to il divided by ch. so as you can see, as we increase the value of this hold capacitor, then this droop rate will reduce. so while selecting the value of this hold capacitor, we should ensure that during the conversion time of the adc or during this hold period, the change in the hold voltage should not be more than half lsb. and by ensuring that, we can get the desired accuracy during the conversion. then if we see the next hold mode specification, then that is the feed-through attenuation ratio. so it shows the fraction of the input signal that appears at the output during the hold mode. and typically, it is expressed in the db. so basically, it shows the ability of the circuit to block the input signal when the circuit is in the hold mode. so ideally during the hold period, when the switch gets opened, then there should not be any connection between the input and the output, right? but many times, the parasitic capacitance exists between the input and the output side. and through this parasitic capacitance, there is a weak coupling of the input signal to the output side. and because of that, some fraction of the input signal is appearing at the output. so this parameter is typically defined at the specific frequency. and again, the value of this parameter should be less than the half lsb of the full-scale input voltage, so that it will not affect the accuracy of the conversion. so these are the hold mode specifications. so now finally, lets see the specification which is defined for the hold mode to the sample mode transition. that means when the sample and hold circuit is going from the hold mode to the sample mode. so one such important specification is the acquisition time. so it shows the maximum time that is required to acquire the new input voltage once the sample command is given. so we know that once the hold command is given, then the sample and hold circuit try to keep the output voltage constant to the last sample value. now during this hold period, if we see the input signal, then it is still changing, right? but here, the sample and hold circuit is not tracking it. but once we apply the sample signal again, then it starts tracking the input signal again. so ideally, it should reach to the input immediately. but in reality, it will take some finite time to reach to this new input level. so once the output of the sample and hold reaches within the specified error band around the input signal, then we can say that the signal is acquired. that means this time required by the sample and hold to reach there within the specified error band is known as this acquisition time. and obviously, the maximum acquisition time will occur when the hold capacitor needs to charge to the full-scale voltage range. so lets say, the full-scale voltage range for the some sample and hold is from -2v to 2v so for example, if the hold capacitor needs to go from the minus two volt to the plus two volt, then in that case, we will see the maximum acquisition time. so this acquisition time depends on the value of the hold capacitor. so for the faster acquisition time, the value of the hold capacitor should be small. but by choosing the small value of the hold capacitor, the droop rate will increase. so there is always a trade-off between the speed and the accuracy. and one should select the sample and hold circuit and the value of the hold capacitor according to the application. so these are the different specifications of the sample and hold circuit. now among these specifications, the two sample and hold specifications are very important for deciding the maximum sampling frequency. that is the maximum frequency at which the input signal can be sampled. so these two specifications are the acquisition time and the hold mode settling time. so these two times show the maximum time that is required by the sample and hold during the sampling and the holding period. and on top of that, we also have this adc conversion time. so these three times show the minimum time that is required by the sample and hold circuit and the adc to complete the one conversion. and if we see the maximum sampling frequency, then that is the inverse of that. so in this way, if we know the different specifications of the sample and hold, then we can easily choose the right sample and hold for the specific application. so i hope in this video, you understood the basic circuit of the sample and hold. and i hope you also understood what are the different important specifications of the sample and hold. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the

will reduce. so while selecting the value of this hold capacitor, we should ensure that during the conversion time of the adc or during this hold period, the change in the hold voltage should not be

take some finite time to reach to this new input level. so once the output of the sample and hold reaches within the specified error band around the input signal, then we can say that the signal is acquired. that means this time required by the sample and hold to reach there within the specified error band is known as this acquisition time. and obviously, the maximum acquisition time will occur when the hold capacitor needs to charge to the full-scale voltage range. so lets say, the full-scale voltage range for the some sample and hold is from -2v to 2v so for example, if the hold capacitor needs to go from the minus two volt to the plus two volt, then in that case, we will see the maximum acquisition time. so this acquisition time depends on the value of the hold capacitor. so for the faster acquisition time, the value of the hold capacitor should be small. but by choosing the small value of the hold capacitor, the droop rate will increase. so there is always a trade-off between the speed and the accuracy. and one should select the sample and hold circuit and the value of the hold capacitor according to the application. so these are the different specifications of the sample and hold circuit. now among these specifications, the two sample and hold specifications are very important for deciding the maximum sampling frequency. that is the maximum frequency at which the input signal can be sampled. so these two specifications are the acquisition time and the hold mode settling time. so these two times show the maximum time that is required by the sample and hold during the sampling and the holding period. and on top of that, we also have this adc conversion time. so these three times show the minimum time that is required by the sample and hold circuit and the adc to complete the one conversion. and if we see the maximum sampling frequency, then that is the inverse of that. so in this way, if we know the different specifications of the sample and hold, then we can easily choose the right sample and hold for the specific application. so i hope in this video, you understood the basic circuit of the sample and hold. and i hope you also understood what are the different important specifications of the sample and hold. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the

AFg16GGRyME,BiCMOS Logic Gates Explained | BiCMOS NAND gate and NOR gates,2025-04-12 19:13:07+00:00,2025,4,Saturday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the BiCMOS logic gates. So in this video, we will see that what is BiCMOS logic, why it is used,  and what are the advantages and disadvantages of this BiCMOS logic. And then after, we will see the circuit of the BiCMOS inverter,  and we will understand the working of it. And after that, we will also see the circuit of the BiCMOS logic gates,  like the NAND gate and the NOR gate. So this BiCMOS logic is the combination of the bipolar logic and the CMOS logic. So this bipolar logic consists of the BJTs, while the CMOS logic consists of the MOS transistors. So first of all, let us understand why the BiCMOS logic is used, and what are the advantages of this logic over the bipolar and the CMOS logic. So for that, first we need to understand the limitations of the CMOS logic. So in the earlier video, we have already seen the CMOS logic gates, and we have seen that the CMOS logic gates consist of the pull-up network and the pull-down network. So this pull-up network consists of the PMOS transistors,  while the pull-down network consists of the NMOS transistors. And depending on the input, at any given time, only one network is ON. So in this CMOS logic gates, the static power consumption is almost zero. So that is one of the advantages of the CMOS logic. Moreover, it also offers the high input impedance,   and the noise margin of the CMOS logic is also very high. That means the logic HIGH is very close to VDD, and the logic LOW is very close to 0V. Apart from that, this logic also offers the high packing density. That means in the same size, it is possible to fit more transistors. But the only disadvantage of this logic is that it cannot drive the high capacitive load. It means that if we drive the very large capacitive loads, then the propagation delay would be very large. And effectively, it will degrade the speed of the overall circuit or the system. So many times, the logic gates can see a very large capacitive load when they are driving the long wires on the chip, or sometimes when they are driving the off-chip printed circuit board traces, where the parasitic capacitance is several hundred times larger than the  parasitic capacitance of the driving gate itself. But in short, when the CMOS logic gates drive very large capacitive loads, then the propagation delay of the logic gate will increase. So that is one issue with the CMOS logic gates. That means it cannot drive the large capacitive loads. On the other hand, if we use the bipolar logic, then it can provide the large output currents, particularly whenever it is used in the emitter follower configuration. And the same thing we have also seen in the ECL logic. And the reason these BJTs can provide the large output current is due to their large transconductance. So as you know, this transconductance is the slope of the IC vs VBE curve. And in the case of the BJT, since we have the exponential relationship between the IC and the VBE, so the BJTs have the large transconductance compared to the MOS transistors. But the disadvantage of the BJT is that its power consumption is more. So this BiCMOS logic is using the best of both bipolar as well as the CMOS logic. And it is particularly useful when we want to drive the large capacitive loads at the high frequency. So in this BiCMOS logic, to reduce the static power consumption and to implement the logic, the CMOS logic is used. And then after, to drive the large capacitive loads on the output side, this bipolar logic is used. So, this BiCMOS logic is often used in the RF and the high frequency applications to implement the mixed signal logic. So such designs have both analog as well as the digital part. And apart from that, it is also used in the high-speed telecommunication. So the only drawback of this logic is that, as it is combining both bipolar as well as the CMOS logic, so the fabrication steps increases. And therefore, the fabrication process of this logic is complex  compared to the CMOS logic. And because of that, the cost of the fabrication also increases. And because of that, the scaling of this logic is also difficult. Therefore, currently it is used only in the very niche applications where the same  performance cannot be achieved using the CMOS logic. So now, let's see the circuit of the BiCMOS inverter and let's understand the working of it. So, in the BiCMOS logic, the transistors of the CMOS logic is driving the NPN transistors. Or to be precise, the output of each pull-up and the pull-down network  in the CMOS logic is driving the NPN transistor. So in case of the inverter, in the pull-up network, we have only the PMOS transistor. So as you can see, the output of the PMOS transistor is driving the NPN transistor. That means the base of the NPN transistor Q1 is connected to the drain of the PMOS transistor. And the emitter of the Q1 acts as an output. And if we see the collector of the Q1, then that is connected to the VDD. Similarly, if we see the pull-down network, then the one end of the pull-down network is connected to the output side. That means here, the one end of the NMOS transistor  or the drain of the NMOS transistor is connected to the output side. And the source terminal is connected to the base of the Q2. So if we see this NPN transistor Q2, then the collector terminal is connected to the output side, while the emitter is connected to the ground terminal. So as you can see over here, these bipolar junction transistors are driving the output while the logic is implemented using the CMOS logic. And therefore, the power consumption of this logic will be low. And here, since the initial logic is also implemented using the CMOS logic,  so the input impedance of these gates will be higher. So now, let's understand the working of this BiCMOS inverter. So in this BiCMOS inverter, when the input is low or the logic '0', then the PMOS transistor will get turned on, while the NMOS transistor will remain in the OFF condition. So here, this PMOS transistor will act as a short circuit, while the NMOS transistor will act as an open circuit. And here, since the PMOS transistor act as a short circuit, so the voltage at the base of the transistor Q1 will be close to VDD. And therefore, this Q1 will get turned ON. On the other end, since the base of the Q2 is not getting any driving voltage,  so it will remain in the OFF condition. And in this condition, this output voltage is equal to VDD minus VB. And this output voltage can be considered as the logic HIGH. That means whenever the input to this inverter is low, then the output is logic HIGH. Similarly, let's see the working of the circuit when the input is HIGH. So whenever the input is HIGH, then the PMOS transistor will remain in the OFF condition. And in this condition, it will act as an open circuit for the Q1. Therefore, this Q1 will also remain in the OFF condition. On the other end, when the input is high,  then this NMOS transistor will get turned ON. And therefore, it will act as a short circuit. So now, whatever voltage or the charge that this load capacitor is holding,  it will appear at the base of the Q2. So earlier, if the output voltage is HIGH,  then this logic HIGH will appear at the base of the Q2. So therefore, this Q2 will get turned ON,  and it will provide the discharging path for this capacitor. So in the ON condition, the voltage between the base and the emitter  of this transistor Q2 will be around 0.7 V. That means in this condition, the output voltage cannot go below that. So we can say that when the input is HIGH, at that time, this Vout is equal to Vbe. And this output can be considered as the logic LOW. So as you can see, in this BiCMOS logic, the voltage swing has now been reduced. Because now, the logic HIGH is equal to Vdd-Vbe, while the logic LOW is equal to Vbe. But in this way, this given BiCMOS circuit works as the inverter. And in this way, it can drive the very large capacitive loads, which cannot be driven by the normal CMOS inverters. Now one more thing if you observe over here, then these two transistors Q1 and Q2  always remains in the active region. Because here, since the base and the collectors are tied together, so in the ON condition of the transistor, the voltage between the collector and the emitter terminal will be same as the Vbe. And since it is more than 0.3 V, which is the typical Vce voltage in the saturation, so we can say that these transistors always remains in the active region. And because of that, these transistors can be turned ON and OFF faster. Now in this design, the issue is that when the input goes from the LOW to HIGH state, then this PMOS transistor will be turned OFF,  while the NMOS transistor will be in the ON condition. So in this case, if you see, then we have a no path to remove the base charge of this Q1. So, because of that, this Q1 will turn OFF slowly, and due to that, we will have the increase in the fall time. Because now, the output voltage will take the time to reach to the logic LOW. Similarly, when the input goes from the HIGH to the LOW state, at that time,  this PMOS transistor will get turned ON. And if you see the NMOS transistor, then it will go in the OFF state. So in this case also, there is a no path to remove the base charge of the Q2. And therefore, the output voltage will not rise to Vdd immediately. That means effectively, the rise time of the logic gate will increase. So this problem can be solved by connecting the resistor at the base of the transistor Q1 and the Q2. So now, when the PMOS transistor is in the OFF condition,  then the base charge of the Q1 can be removed through this resistor. Similarly, when the NMOS transistor Q1 goes to the OFF state, at that time,  the base charge of the Q2 can be removed through this resistor. And in this way, we are providing the path to remove the base charge. But when we are using the passive resistors,  then there will be a static power dissipation in the circuit. For example, when the input is low, at that time, this PMOS transistor will be in the ON condition. And therefore, it will act as a short circuit. So in this condition, through this transistor Qp and the resistor R1, there is a direct path between the Vdd and the ground terminal. And through this path, we will have the static power dissipation. Moreover, when this NMOS and PMOS transistors are in the ON condition, at that time,  these resistors R1 and R2 will also take some of the drain currents of the Qn and Qp. And hence, effectively, that will reduce the available output current of the logic gate. So instead of using the passive resistors, if we use the MOS transistors,  then this issue can be resolved. So here, instead of the resistors, the two transistors QR1 and QR2 are used. So as you can see, the gate of the QR1 is connected to the input node. So now, whenever the input is LOW, at that time,  this PMOS transistor will act as a short circuit. And effectively, this Vdd will appear over here. And because of that, this transistor QR2 will also get turned ON. And in this way, it will remove the base charge of this transistor Q2. Similarly, when the input is high, then this Qp will remain in the OFF condition, while the Qn will get turned ON. And therefore, it will act as a short circuit. So here, now since the input is high, so this QR1 will also get turned ON. And in this way, it will remove the base charge of the Q1. So in this way, instead of using the passive resistors, we can use the NMOS transistors to remove the base charge of the BJTs. Now the issue with this BiCMOS logic is that, we have the reduced voltage swing. And effectively, we have the reduced noise margin compared to the CMOS logic. Because in this case, when the output is HIGH, at that time,  this Vout is equal to Vdd minus Vbe. And whenever this output is LOW, at that time, this Vout is equal to Vbe. So we can say that, in case of the BiCMOS logic, we have the reduced voltage swing. But using some design modification, it is possible to get almost full voltage swing. So this circuit is often called the R-circuit. So if you see this circuit, then it is similar to the earlier BiCMOS inverter circuit, which we have seen with the passive resistors. But here, the one end of the resistor R1 is connected to the output node instead of the ground terminal. And this resistor R2 is connected between the base of the Q2 and the ground. So now, let's see how this circuit works, and how it provides the full voltage swing. So whenever the input is low, then this PMOS transistor will get turned ON. While if we see the NMOS transistor, then it will remain in the OFF condition. So here, the base charge of the transistor Q2 will be removed through this resistor. So here, as soon as the PMOS transistor goes in the ON state,  then the voltage at the base of the Q1 is equal to Vdd. So therefore, this Q1 transistor will get turned ON. And therefore, it offers a lower resistance path and starts charging this capacitive load. So we know that, when this transistor is in the ON condition,  then we will have this voltage drop Vbe. That means here, the output cannot go beyond the Vdd-Vbe. So as soon as the output voltage across the capacitive load reaches this Vdd-Vbe,  then this transistor Q1 will go in the OFF state. But now if you see, then we have the alternate path through this resistor. So after the Q1 goes in the OFF condition, then this capacitive load charges up to Vdd voltage through this resistor R1. And in this way at the output, we will get the Vdd. Similarly, when the input is HIGH, then this NMOS transistor will get turned ON,  while the PMOS transistor will remain in the OFF condition. So in this case, the base charge of the Q1 will be removed through this resistor R1 and the R2. On the other hand, if you see,  then the voltage across this capacitive load will appear at the base of the Q2. So therefore, this Q2 will get turned on, and it will offer the lower resistance path for discharging this capacitor. That means initially, the capacitor will discharge through this transistor. But as we have seen, when the transistor is in the ON condition, then the output voltage cannot go below the Vbe. That means as soon as the output voltage reaches the Vbe,  then this transistor Q2 will get turned OFF. But now in this condition, we have the separate path through this resistor R2. That means this capacitor can be discharged through this resistor R2. And in this way, this load capacitor will discharge fully to the 0V. So we can say that this resistor R2 pulls down the output voltage to the 0V when this Q2 gets turned OFF. And similarly, this upper resistor pulls up the output voltage to the Vdd when the Q1 goes in the OFF state. And in this way, using this circuit, it is possible to get the full voltage swing. So this is the circuit of the BiCMOS inverter. But similarly, it is also possible to implement the other logic gates. For example, this is the circuit of the BiCMOS two input NAND gate. So as you can see, the only change that comes is in the implementation of the CMOS logic. So we know that in the CMOS NAND gate implementation, in the pull-down network,  the two NMOS transistors are connected in the series connection. While if we see the pull-up network, then in the pull-up network,  the two PMOS transistors are connected in the parallel connection. And in this way, this circuit works as the NAND gate. So in this case, when any one of the input goes LOW,  then the PMOS network will get turned ON. And therefore, the base of the Q1 will get connected to the VDD. So therefore, the Q1 will get turned ON, and at the output, you will get the VDD. That is the logic HIGH. On the other end, when both inputs are HIGH, at that time, this PMOS network will get  turned OFF, while the NMOS network will be in the ON condition. So therefore, it will pull down the output voltage to the logic LOW. So in this way, the given circuit works as the 2-input NAND gate. And similarly, we can also implement the NOR gate. So once again, here the only change is in the implementation of the CMOS logic. So we know that in the CMOS NOR gate implementation, in the pull-down network,  the two NMOS transistors are connected in the parallel connection. While in the pull-up network, the two PMOS transistors are connected in the series connection. And in this way, this given circuit works as the NOR gate. So I hope through this video, you understood what is BiCMOS logic,  in which application it is used, and how this BiCMOS logic works. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here  in the comment section below.

all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the bicmos logic gates. so in this video, we will see that what is bicmos logic, why it is used, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of this bicmos logic. and then after, we will see the circuit of the bicmos inverter, and we will understand the working of it. and after that, we will also see the circuit of the bicmos logic gates, like the nand gate and the nor gate. so this bicmos logic is the combination of the bipolar logic and the cmos logic. so this bipolar logic consists of the bjts, while the cmos logic consists of the mos transistors. so first of all, let us understand why the bicmos logic is used, and what are the advantages of this logic over the bipolar and the cmos logic. so for that, first we need to understand the limitations of the cmos logic. so in the earlier video, we have already seen the cmos logic gates, and we have seen that the cmos logic gates consist of the pull-up network and the pull-down network. so this pull-up network consists of the pmos transistors, while the pull-down network consists of the nmos transistors. and depending on the input, at any given time, only one network is on. so in this cmos logic gates, the static power consumption is almost zero. so that is one of the advantages of the cmos logic. moreover, it also offers the high input impedance, and the noise margin of the cmos logic is also very high. that means the logic high is very close to vdd, and the logic low is very close to 0v. apart from that, this logic also offers the high packing density. that means in the same size, it is possible to fit more transistors. but the only disadvantage of this logic is that it cannot drive the high capacitive load. it means that if we drive the very large capacitive loads, then the propagation delay would be very large. and effectively, it will degrade the speed of the overall circuit or the system. so many times, the logic gates can see a very large capacitive load when they are driving the long wires on the chip, or sometimes when they are driving the off-chip printed circuit board traces, where the parasitic capacitance is several hundred times larger than the parasitic capacitance of the driving gate itself. but in short, when the cmos logic gates drive very large capacitive loads, then the propagation delay of the logic gate will increase. so that is one issue with the cmos logic gates. that means it cannot drive the large capacitive loads. on the other hand, if we use the bipolar logic, then it can provide the large output currents, particularly whenever it is used in the emitter follower configuration. and the same thing we have also seen in the ecl logic. and the reason these bjts can provide the large output current is due to their large transconductance. so as you know, this transconductance is the slope of the ic vs vbe curve. and in the case of the bjt, since we have the exponential relationship between the ic and the vbe, so the bjts have the large transconductance compared to the mos transistors. but the disadvantage of the bjt is that its power consumption is more. so this bicmos logic is using the best of both bipolar as well as the cmos logic. and it is particularly useful when we want to drive the large capacitive loads at the high frequency. so in this bicmos logic, to reduce the static power consumption and to implement the logic, the cmos logic is used. and then after, to drive the large capacitive loads on the output side, this bipolar logic is used. so, this bicmos logic is often used in the rf and the high frequency applications to implement the mixed signal logic. so such designs have both analog as well as the digital part. and apart from that, it is also used in the high-speed telecommunication. so the only drawback of this logic is that, as it is combining both bipolar as well as the cmos logic, so the fabrication steps increases. and therefore, the fabrication process of this logic is complex compared to the cmos logic. and because of that, the cost of the fabrication also increases. and because of that, the scaling of this logic is also difficult. therefore, currently it is used only in the very niche applications where the same performance cannot be achieved using the cmos logic. so now, lets see the circuit of the bicmos inverter and lets understand the working of it. so, in the bicmos logic, the transistors of the cmos logic is driving the npn transistors. or to be precise, the output of each pull-up and the pull-down network in the cmos logic is driving the npn transistor. so in case of the inverter, in the pull-up network, we have only the pmos transistor. so as you can see, the output of the pmos transistor is driving the npn transistor. that means the base of the npn transistor q1 is connected to the drain of the pmos transistor. and the emitter of the q1 acts as an output. and if we see the collector of the q1, then that is connected to the vdd. similarly, if we see the pull-down network, then the one end of the pull-down network is connected to the output side. that means here, the one end of the nmos transistor or the drain of the nmos transistor is connected to the output side. and the source terminal is connected to the base of the q2. so if we see this npn transistor q2, then the collector terminal is connected to the output side, while the emitter is connected to the ground terminal. so as you can see over here, these bipolar junction transistors are driving the output while the logic is implemented using the cmos logic. and therefore, the power consumption of this logic will be low. and here, since the initial logic is also implemented using the cmos logic, so the input impedance of these gates will be higher. so now, lets understand the working of this bicmos inverter. so in this bicmos inverter, when the input is low or the logic 0, then the pmos transistor will get turned on, while the nmos transistor will remain in the off condition. so here, this pmos transistor will act as a short circuit, while the nmos transistor will act as an open circuit. and here, since the pmos transistor act as a short circuit, so the voltage at the base of the transistor q1 will be close to vdd. and therefore, this q1 will get turned on. on the other end, since the base of the q2 is not getting any driving voltage, so it will remain in the off condition. and in this condition, this output voltage is equal to vdd minus vb. and this output voltage can be considered as the logic high. that means whenever the input to this inverter is low, then the output is logic high. similarly, lets see the working of the circuit when the input is high. so whenever the input is high, then the pmos transistor will remain in the off condition. and in this condition, it will act as an open circuit for the q1. therefore, this q1 will also remain in the off condition. on the other end, when the input is high, then this nmos transistor will get turned on. and therefore, it will act as a short circuit. so now, whatever voltage or the charge that this load capacitor is holding, it will appear at the base of the q2. so earlier, if the output voltage is high, then this logic high will appear at the base of the q2. so therefore, this q2 will get turned on, and it will provide the discharging path for this capacitor. so in the on condition, the voltage between the base and the emitter of this transistor q2 will be around 0.7 v. that means in this condition, the output voltage cannot go below that. so we can say that when the input is high, at that time, this vout is equal to vbe. and this output can be considered as the logic low. so as you can see, in this bicmos logic, the voltage swing has now been reduced. because now, the logic high is equal to vdd-vbe, while the logic low is equal to vbe. but in this way, this given bicmos circuit works as the inverter. and in this way, it can drive the very large capacitive loads, which cannot be driven by the normal cmos inverters. now one more thing if you observe over here, then these two transistors q1 and q2 always remains in the active region. because here, since the base and the collectors are tied together, so in the on condition of the transistor, the voltage between the collector and the emitter terminal will be same as the vbe. and since it is more than 0.3 v, which is the typical vce voltage in the saturation, so we can say that these transistors always remains in the active region. and because of that, these transistors can be turned on and off faster. now in this design, the issue is that when the input goes from the low to high state, then this pmos transistor will be turned off, while the nmos transistor will be in the on condition. so in this case, if you see, then we have a no path to remove the base charge of this q1. so, because of that, this q1 will turn off slowly, and due to that, we will have the increase in the fall time. because now, the output voltage will take the time to reach to the logic low. similarly, when the input goes from the high to the low state, at that time, this pmos transistor will get turned on. and if you see the nmos transistor, then it will go in the off state. so in this case also, there is a no path to remove the base charge of the q2. and therefore, the output voltage will not rise to vdd immediately. that means effectively, the rise time of the logic gate will increase. so this problem can be solved by connecting the resistor at the base of the transistor q1 and the q2. so now, when the pmos transistor is in the off condition, then the base charge of the q1 can be removed through this resistor. similarly, when the nmos transistor q1 goes to the off state, at that time, the base charge of the q2 can be removed through this resistor. and in this way, we are providing the path to remove the base charge. but when we are using the passive resistors, then there will be a static power dissipation in the circuit. for example, when the input is low, at that time, this pmos transistor will be in the on condition. and therefore, it will act as a short circuit. so in this condition, through this transistor qp and the resistor r1, there is a direct path between the vdd and the ground terminal. and through this path, we will have the static power dissipation. moreover, when this nmos and pmos transistors are in the on condition, at that time, these resistors r1 and r2 will also take some of the drain currents of the qn and qp. and hence, effectively, that will reduce the available output current of the logic gate. so instead of using the passive resistors, if we use the mos transistors, then this issue can be resolved. so here, instead of the resistors, the two transistors qr1 and qr2 are used. so as you can see, the gate of the qr1 is connected to the input node. so now, whenever the input is low, at that time, this pmos transistor will act as a short circuit. and effectively, this vdd will appear over here. and because of that, this transistor qr2 will also get turned on. and in this way, it will remove the base charge of this transistor q2. similarly, when the input is high, then this qp will remain in the off condition, while the qn will get turned on. and therefore, it will act as a short circuit. so here, now since the input is high, so this qr1 will also get turned on. and in this way, it will remove the base charge of the q1. so in this way, instead of using the passive resistors, we can use the nmos transistors to remove the base charge of the bjts. now the issue with this bicmos logic is that, we have the reduced voltage swing. and effectively, we have the reduced noise margin compared to the cmos logic. because in this case, when the output is high, at that time, this vout is equal to vdd minus vbe. and whenever this output is low, at that time, this vout is equal to vbe. so we can say that, in case of the bicmos logic, we have the reduced voltage swing. but using some design modification, it is possible to get almost full voltage swing. so this circuit is often called the r-circuit. so if you see this circuit, then it is similar to the earlier bicmos inverter circuit, which we have seen with the passive resistors. but here, the one end of the resistor r1 is connected to the output node instead of the ground terminal. and this resistor r2 is connected between the base of the q2 and the ground. so now, lets see how this circuit works, and how it provides the full voltage swing. so whenever the input is low, then this pmos transistor will get turned on. while if we see the nmos transistor, then it will remain in the off condition. so here, the base charge of the transistor q2 will be removed through this resistor. so here, as soon as the pmos transistor goes in the on state, then the voltage at the base of the q1 is equal to vdd. so therefore, this q1 transistor will get turned on. and therefore, it offers a lower resistance path and starts charging this capacitive load. so we know that, when this transistor is in the on condition, then we will have this voltage drop vbe. that means here, the output cannot go beyond the vdd-vbe. so as soon as the output voltage across the capacitive load reaches this vdd-vbe, then this transistor q1 will go in the off state. but now if you see, then we have the alternate path through this resistor. so after the q1 goes in the off condition, then this capacitive load charges up to vdd voltage through this resistor r1. and in this way at the output, we will get the vdd. similarly, when the input is high, then this nmos transistor will get turned on, while the pmos transistor will remain in the off condition. so in this case, the base charge of the q1 will be removed through this resistor r1 and the r2. on the other hand, if you see, then the voltage across this capacitive load will appear at the base of the q2. so therefore, this q2 will get turned on, and it will offer the lower resistance path for discharging this capacitor. that means initially, the capacitor will discharge through this transistor. but as we have seen, when the transistor is in the on condition, then the output voltage cannot go below the vbe. that means as soon as the output voltage reaches the vbe, then this transistor q2 will get turned off. but now in this condition, we have the separate path through this resistor r2. that means this capacitor can be discharged through this resistor r2. and in this way, this load capacitor will discharge fully to the 0v. so we can say that this resistor r2 pulls down the output voltage to the 0v when this q2 gets turned off. and similarly, this upper resistor pulls up the output voltage to the vdd when the q1 goes in the off state. and in this way, using this circuit, it is possible to get the full voltage swing. so this is the circuit of the bicmos inverter. but similarly, it is also possible to implement the other logic gates. for example, this is the circuit of the bicmos two input nand gate. so as you can see, the only change that comes is in the

the vdd. that is the logic high. on the other end, when both inputs are high, at that time, this pmos network will get turned off, while the nmos network will be in the on condition. so therefore, it will pull down the output voltage to the logic low. so in this way, the given circuit works as the 2-input nand gate. and similarly, we can also implement the nor gate. so once again, here the only change is in the implementation of the cmos logic. so we know that in the cmos nor gate implementation, in the pull-down network, the two nmos transistors are connected in the parallel connection. while in the pull-up network, the two pmos transistors are connected in the series connection. and in this way, this given circuit works as the nor gate. so i hope through this video, you understood

transistor will get turned on. and therefore, it offers a lower resistance path and starts charging this capacitive load. so we know that, when this transistor is in the on condition, then we will have this voltage drop vbe. that means here, the output cannot go beyond the vdd-vbe. so as soon as the output voltage across the capacitive load reaches this vdd-vbe, then this transistor q1 will go in the off state. but now if you see, then we have the alternate path through this resistor. so after the q1 goes in the off condition, then this capacitive load charges up to vdd voltage through this resistor r1. and in this way at the output, we will get the vdd. similarly, when the input is high, then this nmos transistor will get turned on, while the pmos transistor will remain in the off condition. so in this case, the base charge of the q1 will be removed through this resistor r1 and the r2. on the other hand, if you see, then the voltage across this capacitive load will appear at the base of the q2. so therefore, this q2 will get turned on, and it will offer the lower resistance path for discharging this capacitor. that means initially, the capacitor will discharge through this transistor. but as we have seen, when the transistor is in the on condition, then the output voltage cannot go below the vbe. that means as soon as the output voltage reaches the vbe, then this transistor q2 will get turned off. but now in this condition, we have the separate path through this resistor r2. that means this capacitor can be discharged through this resistor r2. and in this way, this load capacitor will discharge fully to the 0v. so we can say that this resistor r2 pulls down the output voltage to the 0v when this q2 gets turned off. and similarly, this upper resistor pulls up the output voltage to the vdd when the q1 goes in the off state. and in this way, using this circuit, it is possible to get the full voltage swing. so this is the circuit of the bicmos inverter. but similarly, it is also possible to implement the other logic gates. for example, this is the circuit of the bicmos two input nand gate. so as you can see, the only change that comes is in the implementation of the cmos logic. so we know that in the cmos nand gate implementation, in the pull-down network, the two nmos transistors are connected in the series connection. while if we see the pull-up network, then in the pull-up network, the two pmos transistors are connected in the parallel connection. and in this way, this circuit works as the nand gate. so in this case, when any one of the input goes low, then the pmos network will get turned on. and therefore, the base of the q1 will get connected to the vdd. so therefore, the q1 will get turned on, and at the output, you will get the vdd. that is the logic high. on the other end, when both inputs are high, at that time, this pmos network will get turned off, while the nmos network will be in the on condition. so therefore, it will pull down the output voltage to the logic low. so in this way, the given circuit works as the 2-input nand gate. and similarly, we can also implement the nor gate. so once again, here the only change is in the implementation of the cmos logic. so we know that in the cmos nor gate implementation, in the pull-down network, the two nmos transistors are connected in the parallel connection. while in the pull-up network, the two pmos transistors are connected in the series connection. and in this way, this given circuit works as the nor gate. so i hope through this video, you understood what is bicmos logic, in which application it is used, and how this bicmos logic works. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like

UHy056cC9gg,What is Diode Connected Transistor? #allaboutelectronics,2025-04-02 18:09:12+00:00,2025,4,Wednesday,"In this short video, let us understand what is diode connected transistor. So this diode connected transistor is the configuration of the transistor where the two terminals of the transistors are connected together to make it work like the two terminal device. So in case of the BJT to make it work like the diode connected transistor the base and the collector terminals are connected together and in that case it behaves like the P and junction diode and that is why this configuration is called the diode connected transistor. So in this condition since the base and the collector terminals are tied together. So when we bias this transistor then it will operate in the active region. So as you know in the active region as per the shock equation the character current IC can be approximately given as is * e to the power v / v_t or from this the base emitter voltage v can be given by this expression. So for any given transistor the reverse saturation current is and the thermal voltage v_t are fixed at the given temperature. So from this we can say that this base emitter voltage VB is the function of the collector current. So in this diode connectctor transistor if the constant current IC is flowing through the collector terminal then the voltage between the base and the amter or this VB is the function of the collector current and this configuration is widely used in the current mirror circuits. So in this current mirrors this reference transistor is configured as the diode connected transistor. and some constant reference current is passing through the collector terminal. So because of that we will get some voltage VB across the base and the amter terminal. And now the same two terminals are connected to the base and the amter of the second transistor. That means the VB of the second transistor is same as the reference transistor. And if the area of the second transistor is same as the first transistor or in other words if they are perfectly matched then the collector current through the second transistor will be same as the reference transistor. So in this way using the diode connected transistor it is possible to design the current mirror and it is possible to make the copy of the reference current. So the same concept is also used in the MOSFET where the gate and the drain terminals are shorted together and by doing so the MOSFET always operates in the saturation. So using this configuration it is possible to design the MOS based current mirrors. So in this way this diode connected transistor configuration is mainly used in the current mirror circuits and for more information you can check this video on the current mirror.",what is diode

mirror.",-0.07043926,0.04333142,0.07775673,0.09571884,0.017794337,0.017637707,0.11642403,0.10496889,0.102134936,0.08530877,-0.014025402,-0.029224724,0.05403045,-0.025297964,-0.0024291007,0.055028684,0.0005775025,0.043953028,-0.009312526,0.014099145,0.023606237,-0.011379294,-0.048447162,-0.0029283422,-0.01742084,0.009656691,0.1318603,0.02500329,-0.07029545,-0.045044355,-0.027625922,-0.031446584,-0.022456499,0.08466252,-0.11990049,0.015477875,-0.019294627,0.008748524,-0.014951879,-0.00023443197,0.032599423,-0.016727313,-0.0038806666,0.033962347,0.06518643,0.042853963,-0.06940045,0.004892245,-0.07275529,-0.06699198,0.029907865,0.04867762,0.025183462,0.15190482,-0.023391025,0.079689175,0.04079728,0.048427645,-0.06272084,0.010001305,0.042930573,-0.0043359464,-0.018991025,-0.1055759,0.03833456,-0.07551403,0.06014108,0.03759626,-0.0465448,-0.026700625,-0.03557834,0.023892077,0.0011853758,-0.15218039,0.042139716,-0.06803725,0.040076494,0.104586974,0.014468633,-0.029983807,0.14582476,0.023688927,0.083863564,-0.091114305,-0.018908065,-0.055214055,-0.009749265,-0.023440726,0.007932263,0.06908957,-0.014243017,-0.004267871,-0.059207145,-0.042827725,-0.010051611,-0.101561554,0.023172036,0.05546045,0.0914239,-0.015063371,0.005882298,-0.028933642,-0.042186223,0.017025558,-0.06851647,0.021906022,0.05284344,-0.03781433,0.0994567,-0.053412907,-0.017188696,-0.0015385702,-0.023701103,-0.04031682,-0.06418184,-0.070453055,-0.051991764,0.029404702,0.044955514,-0.054003026,-0.0031249255,0.12628372,-0.01211822,-0.00304353,-0.066153415,-0.0577818,-0.008451456,6.292841e-33,0.06930943,0.0059849755,-0.015303579,0.04048758,-0.006377307,-0.0030012792,-0.060667206,0.0046162037,-0.0835085,-0.09368143,-0.0013853329,-0.06788826,0.026775762,0.046664353,0.023766765,-0.019475693,-0.08479118,0.043273848,0.020920906,-0.0556003,0.00918081,0.06619169,-0.0659904,-0.022362735,-0.03468418,-0.0022979134,0.019627692,0.022427306,-0.14481315,0.018676613,-0.05438988,0.01213525,-0.053907312,-0.065389425,-0.0007196962,-0.002706796,-0.0043588853,-0.04149384,-0.007335821,-0.07270446,0.016036067,-0.043167137,0.021766169,0.06326922,-0.045083445,0.0072358474,0.018886216,-0.042443227,0.057263795,0.04233789,-0.038134407,-0.031726234,0.046076976,-0.013612998,-0.013896829,0.05253789,-0.03929258,-9.003901e-06,0.04864721,0.068377845,0.026229091,0.065945484,-0.059845522,-0.056855444,-0.0648308,0.08181828,0.041469228,-0.061303128,0.055110093,0.01599559,-0.01292588,0.07274323,0.018870654,-0.090301566,-0.1287908,0.058716785,-0.0045137503,0.08573069,-0.02861447,-0.011485017,-0.061861932,-0.12748466,-0.01440079,-0.042847663,-0.045361735,-0.01993286,0.016601268,-0.06862101,-0.012835425,-0.0014610358,0.0030659307,-0.08828324,-0.0374955,0.10333445,0.13174886,-6.270845e-33,0.05452293,-0.008234169,-0.036045015,0.039150007,-0.042545144,-0.03333537,0.010741488,0.009111932,-0.041431177,-0.022304136,-0.018962469,-0.024536487,-0.044947263,0.004932212,0.021057129,-0.033852763,-0.030004002,0.010225485,-0.035027433,0.025131684,0.06565167,0.065604076,-0.052771363,-0.062629685,-0.041843552,0.0032120012,0.00527442,0.070495784,0.038526125,0.022349011,-0.0340758,-0.007265093,-0.019929985,0.049589034,-0.05423726,0.017696125,-0.04567018,-0.073186,0.04422227,-0.012561131,0.02911231,0.0273973,-0.0618701,0.005643233,0.022465888,0.08279293,0.06233136,0.021566221,0.098577544,0.0023098572,0.073930666,0.013652137,0.012037636,0.042113177,0.012390778,-0.05732281,-0.067067005,-0.008985939,-0.005982702,-0.034798495,0.015934462,-0.036568698,0.08612872,0.032403715,-0.071832165,-0.044246808,-0.06020205,-0.020805275,0.080241926,-0.05050954,-0.033024922,0.009917167,0.07480458,-0.05326854,-0.035568718,0.03116595,0.01735823,-0.05352106,-0.028179653,0.048340056,-0.07044488,-0.021553863,-0.0071013677,-0.049519118,-0.0026710345,-0.055417024,0.02411665,-0.027454922,-0.04613391,-0.022673747,-0.014811728,-0.023962164,0.019117432,0.09235458,0.0042958986,-6.147785e-08,0.03002153,-0.06468529,-0.044042673,0.04166248,0.08456426,-0.0848109,0.07413581,-0.076969184,-0.02078692,0.07666761,-0.046408568,-0.014136753,-0.015830923,-0.03918807,0.072989285,0.09109033,0.0052079936,-0.0076134317,0.034449387,0.042285677,-0.03201605,-0.067711405,0.046569917,-0.0013189797,0.016231583,0.0830977,-0.01975502,-0.03550777,0.0281139,0.054143667,-0.04893033,0.04577758,-0.008932019,0.014886464,0.06606747,0.040977526,-0.020905446,0.0067122374,0.048210427,-0.0107465405,0.041235793,-0.03741282,0.061375223,0.08304446,-0.04302013,0.030268636,-0.04983043,0.07592927,-0.023727626,0.00054625864,-0.0038076174,-0.01948272,-0.03722641,0.035288464,-0.089788854,0.03959265,0.007039204,0.03424835,0.0549255,0.020645617,0.06281742,0.024770562,0.0060468297,-0.017906774
zx8BVBos2kA,What is PECL and LVPECL logic ? #allaboutelectronics,2025-03-20 17:13:40+00:00,2025,3,Thursday,"In this short video, let us see the two different versions of the ACL logic which are currently used commercially and one of them is the PCL. So here this PCL stands for the positive emitter coupled logic. So conventionally if you know then this ECL logic is using the negative power supply. That means here this VCC is connected to the ground potential while this V is connected to the minus 5.2 2 volt. So when we want to interface this IC with the other logic gates then in between we need to use the level translator IC so that the voltage level of the one IC will match with the other IC. But with that also we need both positive as well as the negative power supplies. So this PSL logic solves this problem as it operates only with the positive power supply. That means here the VCC is equal to 5 volt while the V is connected to the ground potential. And here the reference voltage that is generated internally in the circuit is around 3.6 to 3.7 volt. While if you see the logic low and the logic high voltages then they are plus - 400 m around that voltage. That means here the logic high is 4 volt while the logic low is around 3.2 volt. That means here the difference between the logic low and the logic high or the voltage swing is around 800 m volt. Now as you know this ECL logic is the non-saturated logic. So because of that the power consumption of this ECL logic gate or even the PCL logic gate will be higher than the other logic gates and in fact that is proportional to the supply voltage. So to reduce the power consumption and to make this logic to work even with the lower voltages the next low voltage version of the PAL came into existence. So here this LV stands for the low voltage. So this logic will even work with the 3.3 volt. So of course the IC using this logic consumes lower power compared to the earlier versions. Moreover, now they can also be interfaced with the other low voltage IC or the logic gates using the label translator. So in this logic all the voltage levels changes proportionally. That means here the reference voltage is around 2 volt while the logic low and the logic high is plus - 400 m volt around that voltage. So these logics are typically used in the high-speed applications such as clock distribution system, highspeed telecommunication as well as in the optical trans receivers.",what is pecl and lvpecl logic ? allaboutelectronics,"in this short video, let us see the two different versions of the acl logic which are currently used commercially and one of them is the pcl. so here this pcl stands for the positive emitter coupled logic. so conventionally if you know then this ecl logic is using the negative power supply. that means here this vcc is connected to the ground potential while this v is connected to the minus 5.2 2 volt. so when we want to interface this ic with the other logic gates then in between we need to use the level translator ic so that the voltage level of the one ic will match with the other ic. but with that also we need both positive as well as the negative power supplies. so this psl logic solves this problem as it operates only with the positive power supply. that means here the vcc is equal to 5 volt while the v is connected to the ground potential. and here the reference voltage that is generated internally in the circuit is around 3.6 to 3.7 volt. while if you see the logic low and the logic high voltages then they are plus -

400 m volt around that voltage. so these logics are typically used in the high-speed applications such as clock distribution system, highspeed telecommunication as well as in the optical trans receivers.",-0.027708657,-0.010692034,-0.056214925,0.0023163944,0.06299459,-0.060684606,0.04994678,0.06679127,0.14404497,-0.037978563,0.015224483,-0.04435133,0.023690145,-0.0130698355,0.008060159,0.058613967,-0.072615534,-0.024353625,-0.050047334,0.009330956,0.11241224,-0.050912432,-0.022541627,0.02864365,-0.093873665,-0.00617351,-0.0108662555,0.0849171,0.052849226,-0.08140681,-0.0017549954,0.05931013,-0.0012551805,-0.016834956,-0.05326656,0.02848698,0.030938707,0.013426531,-0.000111985755,-0.048170082,-0.021636328,-0.069115296,-0.074704066,-0.0008150141,-0.04174976,0.03986823,-0.04382112,-0.042878,-0.07474272,-0.13069949,0.05280947,0.010006239,-0.043547973,-0.031522874,-0.11076768,0.023854673,0.0035215386,0.03668352,-0.015003887,-0.05144857,-0.07325358,0.07641227,-0.08899554,0.0027616005,-0.06851182,-0.06660216,0.042194575,-0.039417703,-0.010031734,0.009507604,-0.06315316,-0.08664758,0.0655209,-0.045349043,0.07434903,0.0008182344,0.015709428,-0.03202218,0.0103490045,-0.044733617,0.028946945,0.02183398,-0.110278256,0.03607013,-0.0006132324,-0.031227835,-0.014408408,-0.030770596,0.03377954,-0.07413854,0.101826794,-0.07978906,0.01118756,0.10194561,0.10288434,0.028164772,-0.011472474,-0.09117979,-0.0048172018,0.08823156,-0.03738925,0.014782999,-0.030886473,-0.029650033,-0.010980702,0.083013065,0.04496665,0.03565238,-0.03972102,-0.10878086,-0.028526062,0.023157466,0.030749127,-0.0037907963,-0.060391083,0.07410248,-0.012169191,0.028216358,0.090919174,-0.11151849,-0.09022041,0.00516679,-0.050508946,0.12114753,-0.0001787405,-0.06268589,-0.008627784,7.818861e-33,-0.05951668,0.0056821313,0.08602708,-0.015221878,-0.020373149,0.09115791,0.01351813,-0.069538034,-0.03689718,0.032835167,-0.008715697,-0.023304999,0.007881661,0.051801316,-0.047387496,0.018904286,-0.084722005,-0.0056307744,0.01611412,0.017394159,0.05806968,-0.05107773,-0.025656978,0.054747585,0.066355206,0.056926794,0.044351324,-0.014999363,-0.0057426924,-0.009657928,-0.023164233,0.043604795,0.06994561,0.007054565,-0.0230904,0.09992169,0.054347277,-0.03477117,0.0910482,0.04151845,0.024078112,0.0139203835,0.010444549,0.0065113916,-0.020944042,0.0017036907,-0.063711196,0.120753996,-0.06125906,0.042018414,0.011191061,-0.003995847,-0.06785521,-0.005778262,-0.017177831,-0.024056116,-0.05180222,0.08061449,0.061791807,0.08633812,0.08483431,0.0037907637,-0.018090662,-0.020367773,-0.028871072,0.047538243,-0.10768592,-0.042355523,-0.0111153945,-0.0152800195,-0.029033583,0.094191,0.038365815,-0.03939293,0.0931111,-0.010718535,-0.050835233,0.025273852,0.07279848,0.029778931,-0.027467865,0.012763782,-0.08613625,0.037119716,-0.0066674906,-0.0064984676,-0.06463803,-0.02262698,-0.006662267,0.004007783,-0.012931498,-0.06799307,0.11573277,0.04125991,0.02006685,-7.490216e-33,0.027318578,-0.03089877,0.053459015,-0.010298359,0.006956045,-0.07670215,0.071948774,-0.046824098,-0.012271019,0.07779689,0.01319181,-0.006775766,-0.013730427,0.021019883,0.0016050829,0.022068858,-0.0371442,-0.014283189,0.025885208,0.05920507,0.04510928,0.10100897,-0.03121995,-0.0018823666,0.03259756,0.02795815,-0.011360053,0.069709376,0.020691566,-0.029589377,-0.046831656,0.02688746,0.082770064,0.05009656,-0.047698915,-0.06041973,-0.05089126,-0.06209793,-0.025245773,-0.047560815,-0.08658846,0.023878906,-0.029522436,-0.081295416,0.006543166,0.073693365,0.054986306,0.009791497,0.07364748,-0.121101275,-0.047310088,0.032675143,-0.015194298,0.049740303,0.013601254,-0.0010147255,-0.06494357,0.054974508,-0.052201584,-0.057975695,0.034252685,0.010048144,0.07704904,0.011422448,0.021074815,0.033461057,0.059950784,0.055698786,0.033588033,-0.0028622486,-0.035543516,-0.05145056,0.037790865,-0.11358726,0.0049766,-0.01069936,0.007383495,-0.025030537,0.010829355,-0.086786464,-0.09370186,-0.06605035,-0.03615298,0.038347483,-0.05472267,-0.023398995,0.036179744,0.018816173,0.04049081,0.06874521,-0.07085362,0.003589865,0.072671115,0.05719196,0.08737299,-6.0519355e-08,0.0079990765,0.02041514,-0.07288359,0.03458111,0.041362308,-0.044408802,-0.025145302,-0.044055413,-0.031626627,0.023900986,-0.08180342,-0.011132942,-0.030301789,-0.036728606,0.06959203,0.13258795,0.03518025,-0.009990641,0.05015195,-0.013113758,-0.05607967,-0.026745223,-0.0031214918,0.049858548,0.021691268,0.020780511,0.039738968,0.0018584528,0.009767206,-0.059522666,-0.029684046,0.01938292,-0.005802481,-0.00037855963,0.10913914,0.0669921,-0.06693139,0.02152244,0.02462963,-0.025562229,0.0062372964,-0.06480058,0.0012940577,-0.028258627,0.07693209,0.028500099,-0.029221207,-0.07479815,0.0515928,0.02012457,0.010795766,0.056417253,-0.023586577,0.03131941,-0.034900904,0.02431833,-0.08456145,0.010146221,0.054010436,0.02038612,0.0010408332,0.013921848,0.046126306,-0.049919263
gZdgOcE9FN0,ECL Logic Explained | ECL OR and NOR gate explained,2025-03-10 17:42:20+00:00,2025,3,Monday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the ECL logic. So we will see that what is ECL logic, the advantages of this ECL logic over the other logics and the basic working principle of the ECL logic. And then after, we will also see the circuit of one of the popular 10K series of ECL  gate like the OR and the NOR gate. And through that, we will understand the working of the ECL logic. So this ECL logic is also known as the emitter coupled logic. So similar to the TTL logic, it also uses the bipolar junction transistors. But if you recall, in the TTL logic, the transistors were operating in the saturation  during the switching. So of course, in the advanced TTL logics, the transistor saturation was prevented. But if you see the conventional TTL logic, then here the transistors are operating in the saturation. But this ECL logic is the non-saturated logic. That means here, the transistors do not operate in the saturation. So because of that, there won't be a charge storage issue in the base of the transistor And hence, the speed of the operation will be faster. And moreover, here the voltage swing is also very low. Meaning that, here the difference between the logic low and the logic high is also very low. So therefore, here the parasitic capacitance will also charge faster. And hence, these ECL logic gates are very fast. But here, since it is a non-saturated logic, so transistors are always operating in the active region. And therefore, the power consumption of this ECL gate will be higher. Now the reason this logic is called the emitter-couple logic, because here, the emitter  of the transistors is coupled or connected together. So typically, these ECL gates are used in the high-speed applications, like in the clock distribution system and in the high-speed data communication systems. So in the early days, they were also used in the high-speed computation. But because of its higher power consumption, nowadays, they are not used in the  applications where the energy efficiency is more important. And rather, they are used in the applications where the speed is more important than  the power consumption. So now, let us see the basic element of this ECL logic gate, and let us understand the basic working principle of this ECL logic. So the basic element of this ECL logic is the differential amplifier. And here, this differential amplifier is used as the current steering switch. That means here, by changing the input voltage by the small amount, it is possible to steer the entire current from the one arm of the differential amplifier to the other arm. And for that, here the one arm of the differential amplifier is biased with the fixed voltage. Let's say that is equal to Vr, and the input is applied at the second arm. And here, we are assuming that, the transistors used in the differential amplifiers are the matched pair. That means in all respects, they are identical. Now whenever this Vin = Vr, then the current through both arms will be equal. So here as you can see, at the emitter of this differential amplifier, the current source is connected. So if Vin = Vr, then the current through both arms will be equal to I / 2. But if this Vin is slightly more than the Vr, let's say this Vr + ΔV, then the entire current will flow through this branch. That means this entire current I will flow through this transistor. So at that time, if we see the Vo1, then this Vo1 = Vcc -  I x Rc. That is the drop across this transistor. And similarly, if we see the Vo2 = Vcc. Because this second transistor remains in the off condition. And similarly, when the input is equal to Vr - ΔV, then the entire current will flow through this second transistor. So at that time, if we see the Vo2, then the Vo2 = Vcc - I x Rc. And if we see the Vo1, then this Vo1 will be equal to Vcc. Because this transistor will remain in the off condition. So in this way, by changing the input voltage by the small amount, it is possible to  steer the entire current in the one branch. So very shortly we will see that what should be the value of this ΔV, so that it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to the other branch. But in this way, because of the current steering, we are getting the two possible output states. So one is the Vo = Vcc and the other is equal to Vcc - I x Rc. So due to this current steering capability, sometimes this logic is also referred as the current steering logic or the current mode logic. So here if you observe, then although there is a current switching, but the total current drawn from the supply remains constant. That means at any given time, the current drawn from the supply will be equal to I. And therefore, unlike the TTL or the CMOS logic, there will not be any current spikes during the switching. And that is one of the advantages of the ECL logic. Moreover, if you see the earlier ECL logic gates, then they were using the negative power supply. That means in that case, this Vcc = 0. And instead of the ground, we will have the negative voltage. So in that case, if you see the two possible output states, then these output states will be equal to 0 and - I x Rc. So as you can see, in this case, even if there is a variation in the power supply, then also it won't affect the outputs. Because here we are taking the outputs between these nodes and the ground. And in this way, by using the negative power supply, the fluctuations in the power  supply line will have the minimum effect on the output. And that is why, even though this ECL logic has the low voltage swing, then also it will work properly. And in a way, it is possible to use this ECL logic in very high-speed applications. But the thing is, here this differential pair is the basic element of any ECL logic gate. And as you can see, here this differential pair is used as the current steering switch. So now let's see, in this differential pair, what should be the value of this ΔV. That means by changing this input voltage by the what amount, it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to another branch. So here, first let's assume that the β of these transistors is very high. So we can assume that the emitter current of these transistors is same as the collector current. So here, let's say, the two transistors are Q1 and Q2 respectively. So here, if the Vbe1 is the drop across the base emitter junction of the Q1, then we can say that this IE1 = Is x e ^(Vbe1 / Vt)  where this Vt is the thermal voltage. And similarly, for the second transistor, this emitter current  IE2 ≈  Is x e ^ (Vbe2 / Vt). So if we take the ratio of these two equations, then we can say that this  IE1 / IE2 = e ^ [(Vbe1 - Vbe2 / Vt)]. So now, let's take the natural log on both sides. So if we take the natural log on both sides, then we can say that this  Vbe1 - Vbe2 = Vt x ln (IE1 / IE2). So here, basically we need to find the value of the Δ V. So if you observe over here, then the emitter of both the transistors are connected together. That means here, the Ve1 and Ve2 are equal. So we can say that effectively, that is equal to this Vb1 - Vb2. And that is equal to this Vt x ln (IE1 / IE2). So here, this total current that is IE1 + IE2 is equal to IE. So here, let's say when the Vin =  Vr + ΔV, at that time, this current IE1 is 99% of the IE. And of course, at that time, this IE2 will be equal to 1% of the IE. So we can say that when this Vin = Vr + ΔV, at that time, this IE1 is equal to 99% of IE. So at that time, we can write this expression as this Vbe1 - Vbe2 that is equal to this Vt x ln (99/1) Now as you know, at room temperature, the value of this Vt or the thermal voltage is equal to 25 mV. So if we calculate the value of this Vbe1 - Vbe2, then that is roughly equal to 115 mV. So we can say that when this input voltage is 115 mV above the Vr, at that time, the 99% of the total current flows through this Q1 transistor. So as you can see, even by changing the input voltage, even by this 115 mV, it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to the other branch. And that is why it is possible to operate this ECL logic even with the low voltage swing. So of course, this circuit alone won't work as the ECL gate. Because in the actual circuit, we also need to generate this reference voltage. And we also need to make sure that the logic high and the logic low voltage levels are also identical for both the input and the output side. So that, the output of the one logic gate can be connected to another logic gate. So if you see the commercially available ECL gates, then in that, this 10K and 100K  series are very popular. And of course, nowadays, the different versions of this series are also available. So in these ECL gates, when they are operated with the negative voltage, then the reference voltage is kept around - 1.3V. And if we see the logic high and the logic low voltages, then they are ± 400 mV around this voltage. So if we see the logic high, then that is around -0.9V. And the logic low is around -1.7V to -1.75V. That means when the ECL gates are operated with the negative voltage, then the logic high and the logic low voltages are the negative voltages. And here, this is the circuit of the ECL 10K series two input OR and the NOR gate. So as you can see, one of the advantages of this ECL gate is that, the output and its complement are available at the same time. That means using the same circuit, it is possible to get both OR gate  as well as the NOR gate outputs. So here, this part of the circuit is the current steering part. So here, since it is a two-input gate, so here, this A and B are the two inputs. And as you can see, here these two transistors are connected in parallel, so that it  can perform the OR and the NOR operation. That means here, these two transistors are the input transistor, while if we see the third transistor, then that is the reference transistor. And these three transistors forms the current steering switch. Now one more thing if you observe here, then here, the one end of the supply is connected to the ground terminal, while the other end is connected to the -5.2. That means here, the negative supply is used in this ECL logic. And here, the reference voltage for this transistor is generated using this part of the circuit. And if we see this last part, then that is the emitter follower. So this part performs the level shifting that is required for getting the desired output voltage. Moreover, since it is the emitter follower stage, so it also provides the low output resistance to the load and in a way, it offers the faster rise time. So in this circuit, to make the parasitic capacitance lower,  the size of all the transistors were kept small. And hence, we can assume that the base emitter voltage of all these transistors in the circuit is around 0.75V and the current that is flowing through the emitter is around 1 mA. So assuming that, first let's see how this reference voltage is generated for the given circuit. So here, we will assume that the drop across each diode is around 0.75V. So in that case, we can say that the current through this branch, let's say that is equal to IR is equal to - 5.2V plus, the drop across these two diodes, that is plus 1.5V, divided by the sum of these two resistors. That is equal to 4.98 kΩ plus 907Ω. And here, to find this voltage Vr, first we need to find the drop across this resistor. So we can say that, that is equal to this IR times 907Ω. So if we calculate, then that is roughly equal to -0.57V. That means here, the voltage at this node is equal to -0.57V. And on top of that, if we add the voltage drop Vbe, that is 0.75V, then this voltage Vr is equal to -0.57V -0.75V and that is equal to -1.32V. So that is how the stable reference voltage is generated for this reference transistor. So now let's see, when both A and B inputs are logic low, then how the circuit will behave. And what outputs we are getting. So earlier we have seen that the logic low voltage is around -0.4 V  below the reference voltage. So that is around -1.7V. And similarly, if we see the logic high, then that is 0.4V above the reference voltage. So that is around -0.9V. So here, first let's see how the circuit behaves when both A and B inputs are -1.7V. So here let's say, these three transistors are Q1, Q2 and Q3. So whenever both A and B inputs are logic low or around -1.7V, at that time, this Q1 and Q2 will remain in the off condition. And the entire current will flow through this Q3 transistor. Now here if you observe, then instead of the current source,  at the emitter terminal we have the resistor. That means here, we will have slight variation in the current  depending on the voltage at the emitter terminal. But that change will be marginal. So here, when this Q3 is on, at that time, first let's see the emitter current. So here we have seen that this reference voltage is equal to -1.32V. And here, we assume that this Vbe is equal to 0.75V. So we can say that this emitter current is equal to -5.2V, that is this voltage, plus 0.75V, that is this Vbe drop, plus 1.32V. And in the denominator, we will have this resistor, that is equal to 779Ω. So if we calculate the value of this emitter current, then that is roughly equal to 4 mA. And here, assuming that this beta is very large, this collector current will also remain almost constant. So we can say that when this Q3 transistor is in the on condition, then its collector current is roughly equal to 4 mA. That means here, if we see the drop across this collector resistor, then this VC3 is roughly equal to -4 mA times 245Ω, that is roughly equal to - 0.98V. While if we see the other output or the voltage at the collector of the Q2, then just by looking at this part of the circuit, we can say that that is equal to 0V, because this resistor is connected to the ground terminal. That means we can say that when the A and B inputs are -1.7V, then the one output is equal to -0.98V, while the other output is equal to 0V. But here, we have just seen that for the ECL logic, the logic low is equal to -1.7V, while the logic high is equal to -0.9V. And we know that if we want to use this ECL logic gate in the circuit, then the input and output should have the same logic low and the logic high levels, right? So to make the outputs of the ECL gates compatible with the logic high and the logic low levels, the one more emitter follower stage is used. So this stage serves the two purposes. First is, it performs the required level shifting to get the desired voltages for the logic low and the logic high. So for example, here when both A and B are logic low, at that time, the voltage at this end is equal to -0.98V. But now because of this emitter follower stage, we will also have the drop across this resistor. That is roughly equal to -0.75V. That means here, if we see the Vo2, then that is equal to -0.98V -0.75V. And that is roughly equal to -1.72V. So that is very close to logic low. And similarly, if we see the Vo1, then that is equal to the voltage at this node minus 0.75V. So this Vo1 will also be roughly equal to -0.8V. So in this way, because of this emitter follower stage, we are getting the proper logic high and the logic low levels. So here as you can see, this Vo1 and Vo2 or the outputs of this ECL gate are kept open. But in the actual circuit, either they are connected to the other ECL gate or they are connected to the output load. So typically, in this ECL gate, the transmission line will act as an output load. And it will have the resistance of 50 Ω. So whenever the output to this ECL gate is the transmission line, then this transmission line is terminated with the voltage of -2V. So depending on that load, we will get the value of this Vo1. Because that load will decide the drop across this resistor. Because the drop across this resistor is equal to the current that is flowing through this emitter of this transistor divided by β. And therefore, depending on the load, this Vo1 will slightly change. But typically, it is around -0.8 to 0.9V. And in this way, this voltage can be considered as the logic high. So here, if you see the output Vo2, then it will act as an OR gate. Because whenever both inputs are low, then this Vo2 will be -1.72V. And that can be considered as the logic low. And likewise, when both A and B are high, then this Vo2 will also be high. And on the other end, this Vo1 output will act as an OR gate output. Because here, when both A and B inputs are low, then this Vo1  will be equal to roughly - 0.8V. And that can be considered as the logic high. So in this way, through this Vo1 and Vo2, we are getting both complementary outputs at the same time in this ECL gate. So now, let's see the other case, when both A and B or any one of them is 1. So in that case, the input voltage to this A and B input will be equal to -0.9V. So in that case, either Q1 and Q2 will be ON, while the Q3 will remain in the OFF condition. So here, let's say, this A is equal to 1, while the B is equal to 0. That means here, this A input is equal to - 0.9V, while the B input is equal to -1.7V. So in this condition, the Q3 will remain in the OFF condition, and the entire current will flow through this branch. So in this condition, now let's find the emitter current. So here, this base voltage is equal to -0.9V. And here, if we assume the VBE drop of 0.75V, then this emitter current IE will be equal to -5.2V, plus 0.75V that is the VBE drop, plus 0.9V. And in the denominator, we will have this 779Ω. So if we calculate the value, then this emitter current will be roughly equal to 4.55 mA. And in that condition, the drop across this 220Ω or this VC2 will be equal to - 4.55 mA times 220 Ω. So that is roughly equal to -1V. So because of that, if we see the output voltage, then that is equal to -1V - 0.75V. So that is equal to -1.75V. While if we see the Vo2, then that is equal to -0.75V, minus the drop across this 245Ω. So that will depend on the load. So let's say, the current through the load is equal to IE. So in that case, the drop across this 245Ω will be equal to I divided by β times 245Ω. And roughly it will be equal to -0.8V. That means in that case, this Vo2 can be considered as the logic high. So in this way, when the A and B inputs or any one of them is high, then this Vo2  output will be high, while the Vo1 output will be low. And in this way, this Vo2 output will act as an OR gate, and this Vo1 output will act as an NOR gate. And in this way, this circuit performs the function of the OR and the NOR gate. Now here, if you observe this circuit, then here, the 50K resistor is connected at the input side. That means here, the one end of the 50K resistor is connected to the input terminal, while the other end is connected to the negative power supply. The reason is that the voltage swing in the ECL is very low. So if the input is left open, then also, due to the external noise or the interference, we may get the false logic high or the logic low. So to avoid that, this 50K resistor is connected. So in this case, through the 50K resistor, the input will get tied to the negative power supply. That means here, even when the input is not applied, the input will be considered as the logic low. And in this way, we will not get any false logic high. So that is the purpose of these resistors at the input side. The another thing if you observe, then here, this emitter follower stage has the separate ground. The reason is that these outputs are connected to the external circuit or the load. And on these outputs, there will be a frequent change in the voltage level from logic low to the logic high. So this change should not affect the other part of the circuit  where the stable reference voltage is generated. So that is why, for the current steering as well as for generation of the reference voltage, the separate ground is used. So of course, externally, when we connect the circuit to the ground,  then all the grounds will get common. But internally in the design, they are kept separate to minimize the interference. So I hope in this video, you understood the basics of the ECL logic. Like what is the basic principle of the ECL logic, the advantages of the ECL logic, and the different applications of the ECL logic. And I hope through this circuit, you also understood the basic working of the ECL gate. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe the channel for more such videos.",ecl logic explained ecl or and nor gate explained,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the ecl logic. so we will see that what is ecl logic, the advantages of this ecl logic over the other logics and the basic working principle of the ecl logic. and then after, we will also see the circuit of one of the popular 10k series of ecl gate like the or and the nor gate. and through that, we will understand the working of the ecl logic. so this ecl logic is also known as the emitter coupled logic. so similar to the ttl logic, it also uses the bipolar junction transistors. but if you recall, in the ttl logic, the transistors were operating in the saturation during the switching. so of course, in the advanced ttl logics, the transistor saturation was prevented. but if you see the conventional ttl logic, then here the transistors are operating in the saturation. but this ecl logic is the non-saturated logic. that means here, the transistors do not operate in the saturation. so because of that, there wont be a charge storage issue in the base of the transistor and hence, the speed of the operation will be faster. and moreover, here the voltage swing is also very low. meaning that, here the difference between the logic low and the logic high is also very low. so therefore, here the parasitic capacitance will also charge faster. and hence, these ecl logic gates are very fast. but here, since it is a non-saturated logic, so transistors are always operating in the active region. and therefore, the power consumption of this ecl gate will be higher. now the reason this logic is called the emitter-couple logic, because here, the emitter of the transistors is coupled or connected together. so typically, these ecl gates are used in the high-speed applications, like in the clock distribution system and in the high-speed data communication systems. so in the early days, they were also used in the high-speed computation. but because of its higher power consumption, nowadays, they are not used in the applications where the energy efficiency is more important. and rather, they are used in the applications where the speed is more important than the power consumption. so now, let us see the basic element of this ecl logic gate, and let us understand the basic working principle of this ecl logic. so the basic element of this ecl logic is the differential amplifier. and here, this differential amplifier is used as the current steering switch. that means here, by changing the input voltage by the small amount, it is possible to steer the entire current from the one arm of the differential amplifier to the other arm. and for that, here the one arm of the differential amplifier is biased with the fixed voltage. lets say that is equal to vr, and the input is applied at the second arm. and here, we are assuming that, the transistors used in the differential amplifiers are the matched pair. that means in all respects, they are identical. now whenever this vin vr, then the current through both arms will be equal. so here as you can see, at the emitter of this differential amplifier, the current source is connected. so if vin vr, then the current through both arms will be equal to i 2. but if this vin is slightly more than the vr, lets say this vr δv, then the entire current will flow through this branch. that means this entire current i will flow through this transistor. so at that time, if we see the vo1, then this vo1 vcc - i x rc. that is the drop across this transistor. and similarly, if we see the vo2 vcc. because this second transistor remains in the off condition. and similarly, when the input is equal to vr - δv, then the entire current will flow through this second transistor. so at that time, if we see the vo2, then the vo2 vcc - i x rc. and if we see the vo1, then this vo1 will be equal to vcc. because this transistor will remain in the off condition. so in this way, by changing the input voltage by the small amount, it is possible to steer the entire current in the one branch. so very shortly we will see that what should be the value of this δv, so that it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to the other branch. but in this way, because of the current steering, we are getting the two possible output states. so one is the vo vcc and the other is equal to vcc - i x rc. so due to this current steering capability, sometimes this logic is also referred as the current steering logic or the current mode logic. so here if you observe, then although there is a current switching, but the total current drawn from the supply remains constant. that means at any given time, the current drawn from the supply will be equal to i. and therefore, unlike the ttl or the cmos logic, there will not be any current spikes during the switching. and that is one of the advantages of the ecl logic. moreover, if you see the earlier ecl logic gates, then they were using the negative power supply. that means in that case, this vcc 0. and instead of the ground, we will have the negative voltage. so in that case, if you see the two possible output states, then these output states will be equal to 0 and - i x rc. so as you can see, in this case, even if there is a variation in the power supply, then also it wont affect the outputs. because here we are taking the outputs between these nodes and the ground. and in this way, by using the negative power supply, the fluctuations in the power supply line will have the minimum effect on the output. and that is why, even though this ecl logic has the low voltage swing, then also it will work properly. and in a way, it is possible to use this ecl logic in very high-speed applications. but the thing is, here this differential pair is the basic element of any ecl logic gate. and as you can see, here this differential pair is used as the current steering switch. so now lets see, in this differential pair, what should be the value of this δv. that means by changing this input voltage by the what amount, it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to another branch. so here, first lets assume that the β of these transistors is very high. so we can assume that the emitter current of these transistors is same as the collector current. so here, lets say, the two transistors are q1 and q2 respectively. so here, if the vbe1 is the drop across the base emitter junction of the q1, then we can say that this ie1 is x e vbe1 vt where this vt is the thermal voltage. and similarly, for the second transistor, this emitter current ie2 is x e vbe2 vt. so if we take the ratio of these two equations, then we can say that this ie1 ie2 e vbe1 - vbe2 vt. so now, lets take the natural log on both sides. so if we take the natural log on both sides, then we can say that this vbe1 - vbe2 vt x ln ie1 ie2. so here, basically we need to find the value of the δ v. so if you observe over here, then the emitter of both the transistors are connected together. that means here, the ve1 and ve2 are equal. so we can say that effectively, that is equal to this vb1 - vb2. and that is equal to this vt x ln ie1 ie2. so here, this total current that is ie1 ie2 is equal to ie. so here, lets say when the vin vr δv, at that time, this current ie1 is 99 of the ie. and of course, at that time, this ie2 will be equal to 1 of the ie. so we can say that when this vin vr δv, at that time, this ie1 is equal to 99 of ie. so at that time, we can write this expression as this vbe1 - vbe2 that is equal to this vt x ln 991 now as you know, at room temperature, the value of this vt or the thermal voltage is equal to 25 mv. so if we calculate the value of this vbe1 - vbe2, then that is roughly equal to 115 mv. so we can say that when this input voltage is 115 mv above the vr, at that time, the 99 of the total current flows through this q1 transistor. so as you can see, even by changing the input voltage, even by this 115 mv, it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to the other branch. and that is why it is possible to operate this ecl logic even with the low voltage swing. so of course, this circuit alone wont work as the ecl gate. because in the actual circuit, we also need to generate this reference voltage. and we also need to make sure that the logic high and the logic low voltage levels are also identical for both the input and the output side. so that, the output of the one logic gate can be connected to another logic gate. so if you see the commercially available ecl gates, then in that, this 10k and 100k series are very popular. and of course, nowadays, the different versions of this series are also available. so in these ecl gates, when they are operated with the negative voltage, then the reference voltage is kept around - 1.3v. and if we see the logic high and the logic low voltages, then they are 400 mv around this voltage. so if we see the logic high, then that is around -0.9v. and the logic low is around -1.7v to -1.75v. that means when the ecl gates are operated with the negative voltage, then the logic high and the logic low voltages are the negative voltages. and here, this is the circuit of the ecl 10k series two input or and the nor gate. so as you can see, one of the advantages of this ecl gate is that, the output and its complement are available at the same time. that means using the same circuit, it is possible to get both or gate as well as the nor gate outputs. so here, this part of the circuit is the current steering part. so here, since it is a two-input gate, so here, this a and b are the two inputs. and as you can see, here these two transistors are connected in parallel, so that it can perform the or and the nor operation. that means here, these two transistors are the input transistor, while if we see the third transistor, then that is the reference transistor. and these three transistors forms the current steering switch. now one more thing if you observe here, then here, the one end of the supply is connected to the ground terminal, while the other end is connected to the -5.2. that means here, the negative supply is used in this ecl logic. and here, the reference voltage for this transistor is generated using this part of the circuit. and if we see this last part, then that is the emitter follower. so this part performs the level shifting that is required for getting the desired output voltage. moreover, since it is the emitter follower stage, so it also provides the low output resistance to the load and in a way, it offers the faster rise time. so in this circuit, to make the parasitic capacitance lower, the size of all the transistors were kept small. and hence, we can assume that the base emitter voltage of all these transistors in the circuit is around 0.75v and the current that is flowing through the emitter is around 1 ma. so assuming that, first lets see how this reference voltage is generated for the given circuit. so here, we will assume that the drop across each diode is around 0.75v. so in that case, we can say that the current through this branch, lets say that is equal to ir is equal to - 5.2v plus, the drop across these two diodes, that is plus 1.5v, divided by the sum of these two resistors. that is equal to 4.98 kω plus 907ω. and here, to find this voltage vr, first we need to find the drop across this resistor. so we can say that, that is equal to this ir times 907ω. so if we calculate, then that is roughly equal to -0.57v. that means here, the voltage at this node is equal to -0.57v. and on top of that, if we add the voltage drop vbe, that is 0.75v, then this voltage vr is equal to -0.57v -0.75v and that is equal to -1.32v. so that is how the stable reference voltage is generated for this reference transistor. so now lets see, when both a and b inputs are logic low, then how the circuit will behave. and what outputs we are getting. so earlier we have seen that the logic low voltage is around -0.4 v below the reference voltage. so that is around -1.7v. and similarly, if we see the logic high, then that is 0.4v above the reference voltage. so that is around -0.9v. so here, first lets see how the circuit behaves when both a and b inputs are -1.7v. so here lets say, these three transistors are q1, q2 and q3. so whenever both a and b inputs are logic low or around -1.7v, at that time, this q1 and q2 will remain in the off condition. and the entire current will flow through this q3 transistor. now here if you observe, then instead of the current source, at the emitter terminal we have the resistor. that means here, we will have slight variation in the current depending on the voltage at the emitter terminal. but that change will be marginal. so here, when this q3 is on, at that time, first lets see the emitter current. so here we have seen that this reference voltage is equal to -1.32v. and here, we assume that this vbe is equal to 0.75v. so we can say that this emitter current is equal to -5.2v, that is this voltage, plus 0.75v, that is this vbe drop, plus 1.32v. and in the denominator, we will have this resistor, that is equal to 779ω. so if we calculate the value of this emitter current, then that is roughly equal to 4 ma. and here, assuming that this beta is very large, this collector current will also remain almost constant. so we can say that when this q3 transistor is in the on condition, then its collector current is roughly equal to 4 ma. that means here, if we see the drop across this collector resistor, then this vc3 is roughly equal to -4 ma times 245ω, that is roughly equal to - 0.98v. while if we see the other output or the voltage at the collector of the q2, then just by looking at this part of the circuit, we can say that that is equal to 0v, because this resistor is connected to the ground terminal. that means we can say that when the a and b inputs are -1.7v, then the one output is equal to -0.98v, while the other output is equal to 0v. but here, we have just seen that for the ecl logic, the logic low is equal to -1.7v, while the logic high is equal to -0.9v. and we know that if we want to use this ecl logic gate in the circuit, then the input and output should have the same logic low and the logic high levels, right? so to make the outputs of the ecl gates compatible with the logic high and the logic low levels, the one more emitter follower stage is used. so this stage serves the two purposes. first is, it performs the required level shifting to get the desired voltages for the logic low and the logic high. so for example, here when both a and b are logic low, at that time, the voltage at this end is equal to -0.98v. but now because of this emitter follower stage, we will also have the drop across this resistor. that is roughly equal to -0.75v. that means here, if we see the vo2, then that is equal to -0.98v -0.75v. and that is roughly equal to -1.72v. so that is very close to logic low. and similarly, if we see the vo1, then that is equal to the voltage at this node minus 0.75v. so this vo1 will also be roughly equal to -0.8v. so in this way, because of this emitter follower stage, we are getting the proper logic high and the logic low levels. so here as you can see, this vo1 and vo2 or the outputs of this ecl gate are kept open. but in the actual circuit, either they are connected to the other ecl gate or they are connected to the output load. so typically, in this ecl gate, the transmission line will act as an output load. and it will have the resistance of 50 ω. so whenever the output to this ecl gate is the transmission line, then this transmission line is terminated with the voltage of -2v. so depending on that load, we will get the value of this vo1. because that load will decide the drop across this resistor. because the drop across this resistor is equal to the current that is flowing through this emitter of this transistor divided by β. and therefore, depending on the load, this vo1 will slightly change. but typically, it is around -0.8 to 0.9v. and in this way, this voltage can be considered as the logic high. so here, if you see the output vo2, then it will act as an or gate. because whenever both inputs are low, then this vo2 will be -1.72v. and that can be considered as the logic low. and likewise, when both a and b are high, then this vo2 will also be high. and on the other end, this vo1 output will act as an or gate output. because here, when both a and b inputs are low, then this vo1 will be equal to roughly - 0.8v. and that can be considered as the logic high. so in this way, through this vo1 and vo2, we are getting both complementary outputs at the same time in this ecl gate. so now, lets see the other case, when both a and b or any one of them is 1. so in that case, the input voltage to this a and b input will be equal to -0.9v. so in that case, either q1 and q2 will be on, while the q3 will remain in the off condition. so here, lets say, this a is equal to 1, while the b is equal to 0. that means here, this a input is equal to - 0.9v, while the b input is equal to -1.7v. so in this condition, the q3 will remain in the off condition, and the entire current will flow through this branch. so in this condition, now lets find the emitter current. so here, this base voltage is equal to -0.9v. and here, if we assume the vbe drop of 0.75v, then this emitter current ie will be equal to -5.2v, plus 0.75v that is the vbe drop, plus 0.9v. and in the denominator, we will have this 779ω. so if we calculate the value, then this emitter current will be roughly equal to 4.55 ma. and in that condition, the drop across this 220ω or this vc2 will be equal to - 4.55 ma times 220 ω. so that is roughly equal to -1v. so because of that, if we see the output voltage, then that is equal to -1v - 0.75v. so that is equal to -1.75v. while if we see the vo2, then that is equal to -0.75v, minus the drop across this 245ω. so that will depend on the load. so lets say, the current through the load is equal to ie. so in that case, the drop across this 245ω will be equal to i divided by β times 245ω. and roughly it will be equal to -0.8v. that means in that case, this vo2 can be considered as the logic high. so in this way, when the a and b inputs or any one of them is high, then this vo2 output will be high, while the vo1 output will be low. and in this way, this vo2 output will act as an or gate, and this vo1 output will act as an nor gate. and in this way, this circuit performs the function of the or and the nor gate. now here, if you observe this circuit, then here, the 50k resistor is connected at the input side. that means here, the one end of the 50k resistor is connected to the input terminal, while the other end is connected to the negative power supply. the reason is that the voltage swing in the ecl is very low. so if the

arm of the differential amplifier to the other arm. and for that, here the one arm of the differential amplifier is biased with the fixed voltage. lets say that is equal to vr, and the input is applied at the second arm. and here, we are assuming that, the transistors used in the differential amplifiers are the matched pair. that means in all respects, they are identical. now whenever this vin vr, then the current through both arms will be equal. so here as you can see, at the emitter of this differential amplifier, the current source is connected. so if vin vr, then the current through both arms will be equal to i 2. but if this vin is slightly more than the vr, lets say this vr δv, then the entire current will flow through this branch. that means this entire current i will flow through this transistor. so at that time, if we see the vo1, then this vo1 vcc - i x rc. that is the drop across this transistor. and similarly, if we see the vo2 vcc. because this second transistor remains in the off condition. and similarly, when the input is equal to vr - δv, then the entire current will flow through this second transistor. so at that time, if we see the vo2, then the vo2 vcc - i x rc. and if we see the vo1, then this vo1 will be equal to vcc. because this transistor will remain in the off condition. so in this way, by changing the input voltage by the small amount, it is possible to steer the entire current in the one branch. so very shortly we will see that what should be the value of this δv, so that it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to the other branch. but in this way, because of the current steering, we are getting the two possible output states. so one is the vo vcc and the other is equal to vcc - i x rc. so due to this current steering capability, sometimes this logic is also referred as the current steering logic or the current mode logic. so here if you observe, then although there is a current switching, but the total current drawn from the supply remains constant. that means at any given time, the current drawn from the supply will be equal to i. and therefore, unlike the ttl or the cmos logic, there will not be any current spikes during the switching. and that is one of the advantages of the ecl logic. moreover, if you see the earlier ecl logic gates, then they were using the negative power supply. that means in that case, this vcc 0. and instead of the ground, we will have the negative voltage. so in that case, if you see the two possible output states, then these output states will be equal to 0 and - i x rc. so as you can see, in this case, even if there is a variation in the power supply, then also it wont affect the outputs. because here we are taking the outputs between these nodes and the ground. and in this way, by using the negative power supply, the fluctuations in the power supply line will have the minimum effect on the output. and that is why, even though this ecl logic has the low voltage swing, then also it will work properly. and in a way, it is possible to use this ecl logic in very high-speed applications. but the thing is, here this differential pair is the basic element of any ecl logic gate. and as you can see, here this differential pair is used as the current steering switch. so now lets see, in this differential pair, what should be the value of this δv. that means by changing this input voltage by the what amount, it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to another branch. so here, first lets assume that the β of these transistors is very high. so we can assume that the emitter current of these transistors is same as the collector current. so here, lets say, the two transistors are q1 and q2 respectively. so here, if the vbe1 is the drop across the base emitter junction of the q1, then we can say that this ie1 is x e vbe1 vt where this vt is the thermal voltage. and similarly, for the second transistor, this emitter current ie2 is x e vbe2 vt. so if we take the ratio of these two equations, then we can say that this ie1 ie2 e vbe1 - vbe2 vt. so now, lets take the natural log on both sides. so if we take the natural log on both sides, then we can say that this vbe1 - vbe2 vt x ln ie1 ie2. so here, basically we need to find the value of the δ v. so if you observe over here, then the emitter of both the transistors are connected together. that means here, the ve1 and ve2 are equal. so we can say that effectively, that is equal to this vb1 - vb2. and that is equal to this vt x ln ie1 ie2. so here, this total current that is ie1 ie2 is equal to ie. so here, lets say when the vin vr δv, at that time, this current ie1 is 99 of the ie. and of course, at that time, this ie2 will be equal to 1 of the ie. so we can say that when this vin vr δv, at that time, this ie1 is equal to 99 of ie. so at that time, we can write this expression as this vbe1 - vbe2 that is equal to this vt x ln 991 now as you know, at room temperature, the value of this vt or the thermal voltage is equal to 25 mv. so if we calculate the value of this vbe1 - vbe2, then that is roughly equal to 115 mv. so we can say that when this input voltage is 115 mv above the vr, at that time, the 99 of the total current flows through this q1 transistor. so as you can see, even by changing the input voltage, even by this 115 mv, it is possible to steer the entire current from one branch to the other branch. and that is why it is possible to operate this ecl logic even with the low voltage swing. so of course, this circuit alone wont work as the ecl gate. because in the actual circuit, we also need to generate this reference voltage. and we also need to make sure that the logic high and the logic low voltage levels are also identical for both the input and the output side. so that, the output of the one logic gate can be connected to another logic gate. so if you see the commercially available ecl gates, then in that, this 10k and 100k series are very popular. and of course, nowadays, the different versions of this series are also available. so in these ecl gates, when they are operated with the negative voltage, then the reference voltage is kept around - 1.3v. and if we see the logic high and the logic low voltages, then they are 400 mv around this voltage. so if we see the logic high, then that is around -0.9v. and the logic low is around -1.7v to -1.75v. that means when the ecl gates are operated with the negative voltage, then the logic high and the logic low voltages are the negative voltages. and here, this is the circuit of the ecl 10k series two input or and the nor gate. so as you can see, one of the advantages of this ecl gate is that, the output and its complement are available at the same time. that means using the same circuit, it is possible to get both or gate as well as the nor gate outputs. so here, this part of the circuit is the current steering part. so here, since it is a two-input gate, so here, this a and b are the two inputs. and as you can see, here these two transistors are connected in parallel, so that it can perform the or and the nor operation. that means here, these two transistors are the input transistor, while if we see the third transistor, then that is the reference transistor. and these three transistors forms the current steering switch. now one more thing if you observe here, then here, the one end of the supply is connected to the ground terminal, while the other end is connected to the -5.2. that means here, the negative supply is used in this ecl logic. and here, the reference voltage for this transistor is generated using this part of the circuit. and if we see this last part, then that is the emitter follower. so this part performs the level shifting that is required for getting the desired output voltage. moreover, since it is the emitter follower stage, so it also provides the low output resistance to the load and in a way, it offers the faster rise time. so in this circuit, to make the parasitic capacitance lower, the size of all the transistors were kept small. and hence, we can assume that the base emitter voltage of all these transistors in the circuit is around 0.75v and the current that is flowing through the emitter is around 1 ma. so assuming that, first lets see how this reference voltage is generated for the given circuit. so here, we will assume that the drop across each diode is around 0.75v. so in that case, we can say that the current through this branch, lets say that is equal to ir is equal to - 5.2v plus, the drop across these two diodes, that is plus 1.5v, divided by the sum of these two resistors. that is equal to 4.98 kω plus 907ω. and here, to find this voltage vr, first we need to find the drop across this resistor. so we can say that, that is equal to this ir times 907ω. so if we calculate, then that is roughly equal to -0.57v. that means here, the voltage at this node is equal to -0.57v. and on top of that, if we add the voltage drop vbe, that is 0.75v, then this voltage vr is equal to -0.57v -0.75v and that is equal to -1.32v. so that is how the stable reference voltage is generated for this reference transistor. so now lets see, when both a and b inputs are logic low, then how the circuit will behave. and what outputs we are getting. so earlier we have seen that the logic low voltage is around -0.4 v below the reference voltage. so that is around -1.7v. and similarly, if we see the logic high, then that is 0.4v above the reference voltage. so that is around -0.9v. so here, first lets see how the circuit behaves when both a and b inputs are -1.7v. so here lets say, these three transistors are q1, q2 and q3. so whenever both a and b inputs are logic low or around -1.7v, at that time, this q1 and q2 will remain in the off condition. and the entire current will flow through this q3 transistor. now here if you observe, then instead of the current source, at the emitter terminal we have the resistor. that means here, we will have slight variation in the current depending on the voltage at the emitter terminal. but that change will be marginal. so here, when this q3 is on, at that time, first lets see the emitter current. so here we have seen that this reference voltage is equal to -1.32v. and here, we assume that this vbe is equal to 0.75v. so we can say that this emitter current is equal to -5.2v, that is this voltage, plus 0.75v, that is this vbe drop, plus 1.32v. and in the denominator, we will have this resistor, that is equal to 779ω. so if we calculate the value of this emitter current, then that is roughly equal to 4 ma. and here, assuming that this beta is very large, this collector current will also remain almost constant. so we can say that when this q3 transistor is in the on condition, then its collector current is roughly equal to 4 ma. that means here, if we see the drop across this collector resistor, then this vc3 is roughly equal to -4 ma times 245ω, that is roughly equal to - 0.98v. while if we see the other output or the voltage at the collector of the q2, then just by looking at this part of the circuit, we can say that that is equal to 0v, because this resistor is connected to the ground terminal. that means we can say that when the a and b inputs are -1.7v, then the one output is equal to -0.98v, while the other output is equal to 0v. but here, we have just seen that for the ecl logic, the logic low is equal to -1.7v, while the logic high is equal to -0.9v. and we know that if we want to use this ecl logic gate in the circuit, then the input and output should have the same logic low and the logic high levels, right? so to make the outputs of the ecl gates compatible with the logic high and the logic low levels, the one more emitter follower stage is used. so this stage serves the two purposes. first is, it performs the required level shifting to get the desired voltages for the logic low and the logic high. so for example, here when both a and b are logic low, at that time, the voltage at this end is equal to -0.98v. but now because of this emitter follower stage, we will also have the drop across this resistor. that is roughly equal to -0.75v. that means here, if we see the vo2, then that is equal to -0.98v -0.75v. and that is roughly equal to -1.72v. so that is very close to logic low. and similarly, if we see the vo1, then that is equal to the voltage at this node minus 0.75v. so this vo1 will also be roughly equal to -0.8v. so in this way, because of this emitter follower stage, we are getting the proper logic high and the logic low levels. so here as you can see, this vo1 and vo2 or the outputs of this ecl gate are kept open. but in the actual circuit, either they are connected to the other ecl gate or they are connected to the output load. so typically, in this ecl gate, the transmission line will act as an output load. and it will have the resistance of 50 ω. so whenever the output to this ecl gate is the transmission line, then this transmission line is terminated with the voltage of -2v. so depending on that load, we will get the value of this vo1. because that load will decide the drop across this resistor. because the drop across this resistor is equal to the current that is flowing through this emitter of this transistor divided by β. and therefore, depending on the load, this vo1 will slightly change. but typically, it is around -0.8 to 0.9v. and in this way, this voltage can be considered as the logic high. so here, if you see the output vo2, then it will act as an or gate. because whenever both inputs are low, then this vo2 will be -1.72v. and that can be considered as the logic low. and likewise, when both a and b are high, then this vo2 will also be high. and on the other end, this vo1 output will act as an or gate output. because here, when both a and b inputs are low, then this vo1 will be equal to roughly - 0.8v. and that can be considered as the logic high. so in this way, through this vo1 and vo2, we are getting both complementary outputs at the same time in this ecl gate. so now, lets see the other case, when both a and b or any one of them is 1. so in that case, the input voltage to this a and b input will be equal to -0.9v. so in that case, either q1 and q2 will be on, while the q3 will remain in the off condition. so here, lets say, this a is equal to 1, while the b is equal to 0. that means here, this a input is equal to - 0.9v, while the b input is equal to -1.7v. so in this condition, the q3 will remain in the off condition, and the entire current will flow through this branch. so in this condition, now lets find the emitter current. so here, this base voltage is equal to -0.9v. and here, if we assume the vbe drop of 0.75v, then this emitter current ie will be equal to -5.2v, plus 0.75v that is the vbe drop, plus 0.9v. and in the denominator, we will have this 779ω. so if we calculate the value, then this emitter current will be roughly equal to 4.55 ma. and in that condition, the drop across this 220ω or this vc2 will be equal to - 4.55 ma times 220 ω. so that is roughly equal to -1v. so because of that, if we see the output voltage, then that is equal to -1v - 0.75v. so that is equal to -1.75v. while if we see the vo2, then that is equal to -0.75v, minus the drop across this 245ω. so that will depend on the load. so lets say, the current through the load is equal to ie. so in that case, the drop across this 245ω will be equal to i divided by β times 245ω. and roughly it will be equal to -0.8v. that means in that case, this vo2 can be considered as the logic high. so in this way, when the a and b inputs or any one of them is high, then this vo2 output will be high, while the vo1 output will be low. and in this way, this vo2 output will act as an or gate, and this vo1 output will act as an nor gate. and in this way, this circuit performs the function of the or and the nor gate. now here, if you observe this circuit, then here, the 50k resistor is connected at the input side. that means here, the one end of the 50k resistor is connected to the input terminal, while the other end is connected to the negative power supply. the reason is that the voltage swing in the ecl is very low. so if the input is left open, then also, due to the external noise or the interference, we may get the false logic high or the logic low. so to avoid that, this 50k resistor is connected. so in this case, through the 50k resistor, the input will get tied to the negative power supply. that means here, even when the input is not applied, the input will be considered as the logic low. and in this way, we will not get any false logic high. so that is the purpose of these resistors at the input side. the another thing if you observe, then here, this emitter follower stage has the separate ground. the reason is that these outputs are connected to the external circuit or the load. and on these outputs, there will be a frequent change in the voltage level from logic low to the logic high. so this change should not affect the other part of the circuit where the stable reference voltage is generated. so that is why, for the current steering as well as for generation of the reference voltage, the separate ground is used. so of course, externally, when we connect the circuit to the ground, then all the grounds will get common. but internally in the design, they are kept separate to minimize the interference. so i hope in this video, you understood the basics of the ecl logic. like what is the basic principle of the ecl logic, the advantages of the ecl logic, and the different applications of

h2dRSxNb4to,Why do LEDs emit Light while Diodes do not ?#led #diode,2025-02-24 18:31:18+00:00,2025,2,Monday,"In this short video, let's understand why do LEDs emit light while the diodes do not. So if you see the LED or the light-emitting diode, then it is also one kind of p-n junction diode. Because its electrical characteristic is similar to the normal p-n junction diode. That means unless the voltage between the anode and the cathode of the LED is less  than the cut-in voltage or the threshold voltage, then it will remain in the off condition. But when this voltage exceeds the threshold voltage, then suddenly current starts  flowing through the LED. And during this process, the LED also emits the light. But if you see the normal p-n junction diode, then it does not emit any light. The reason is that the normal p-n junction diode is made up of the semiconductor materials like the silicon and the germanium. So in the normal p-n junction diode, during the electron hole recombination process,  when the electrons from the conduction band combine with the holes in the valence band, then they release the energy in the form of heat. But that is not the case with the LEDs. Because the semiconductor materials that are used for making the LEDs  are other than the silicon. And with these materials, when the electrons in the conduction band combine with  the holes in the valence band, then they release the energy in the form of light. And the wavelength of the light depends on the materials that are used for making these LEDs. So to get the different colors, the different materials are used. So these materials are known as the direct band gap semiconductors. Meaning that in these materials, if we see the energy versus momentum curve,  then the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band  have the same momentum value. And because of that, when the electrons from the conduction band combine with the holes in the valence band, then they are able to release this additional energy  in the form of photons. But that is not the case with the normal p-n junction diode. Because these diodes are made up of either silicon or germanium. And these semiconductor materials are known as the indirect band gap semiconductors. Meaning that in these materials, if we see the energy versus momentum curve,  then the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction bands are not aligned. So due to this different value of the momentum, to conserve the momentum,  for the electron-hole recombination process, first electron needs to transfer the  momentum to the crystal lattice. So due to this transfer of momentum, we will see the lattice vibration in the structure. So due to this lattice vibration, the heat will get generated. So in simple terms, we can say that the electrons have released the energy in the form of heat. And because of this, in the normal p-n junction diode, during this electron hole recombination process, the photons cannot get released.",why do leds emit light while diodes do not ?led diode,"in this

UinhkuseB2Y,"TTL Sub Families | Schottky TTL (74 S series), Low Power Schottky TTL (74 LS) Explained",2025-02-15 17:44:15+00:00,2025,2,Saturday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will see the subfamily of the TTL logic. And we will see that how the TTL logic evolved over time, and how the different versions of the TTL came into existence. So so far, all the discussion related to the TTL logic, which we have carried out, that was for the standard TTL version, which is often known as the 74 series. So for example, the 7400 is the IC for the standard TTL two input NAND gate. And likewise, the 7404 is the IC for the inverter. So after the standard TTL gates, the different versions of the TTL also came. So the main purpose of all these different versions was to either reduce the power consumption or to increase the speed of the TTL gates. So if you see the typical power consumption of the TTL gate,  then that is roughly around 10 mW. While if you see the speed or the propagation delay of this logic gate,  then that is roughly around 9 to 10 ns. So all the versions that came after the standard TTL gates have either lower power consumption or the higher speed compared to the standard version. So during our discussion, we will take the reference of the standard two input TTL NAND gate. And with respect to that, we will see that what modifications were made  in the different versions of the TTL. So the first two series, that came after the standard 74 series, were the 74L and 74H. So if you see the 74L series, then that is the low-power TTL logic. So the design wise, it is same as the standard TTL logic. But here, the resistor values were increased. So because of the increase in the resistor values, the current drawn by the circuit will also reduce. And because of that, the power consumption of the logic gate will also reduce. But at the same time, because of the lower current,  the capacitive load at the output also charges slower. So if you see the typical power consumption of the 74L series gates,  then that is around 1 mW. So as you can see, compared to the standard 74 series version, there is a substantial reduction in the power consumption. But at the same time, the speed will also reduce. So here, the propagation delay is roughly around 33 ns. So that is the 74L series. That is the low-power TTL logic. So then after, to increase the speed of the logic gates, the 74L series came,  which is also known as the high-speed TTL logic. So in this version, the values of all the resistors were reduced. And because of the lower resistance values, the current in the circuit increases. And due to the higher current, the capacity load charges faster. And due to that, we will see the increase in the speed of the logic gate. And further, to increase the speed, here on the output side, the Darlington pair is used. So as you know, this Darlington pair provides the higher current gain. That is roughly equal to β². So when this Darlington pair is in the ON condition, then due to this higher current, the capacitive load at the output charge is faster. And hence, we will have the faster turn-on time. So if we see the same thing in the other way,  then the output resistance of this Darlington pair is even lower. So due to this lower resistance, the RC time constant will also reduce. And hence, we will have the faster turn-on time. Now here, the purpose of this resistor at the emitter of the Q4 is that, when this Darlington pair goes in the OFF condition, then the charge that is stored at the base of this Q5  will be removed through this resistor. So in short, because of this Darlington pair at the output side, and due to the lower resistance values, the propagation delay of the 74H series gates is lower compared  to the standard TTL gates. But due to the higher current, the power dissipation will be more. So here, for the 74H series, the typical power consumption is around 23 mW. While if we see the propagation delay or the speed of the logic gate,  then that is roughly around 6 ns. So for any logic gate of any family, the important metric to measure its speed and power efficiency is the speed power product. And as its name suggests, it is the product of the average power that is consumed by  the gate and the speed of the gate. So this parameter defines the energy consumed by the logic gate per switching operation. And often it is represented in the picojoules. So the lower value of this parameter indicates the better efficiency of the logic gate. So for the 74H series, if we see the speed power product, then that is around 138 picojoules. And in fact, that is even higher than the standard TTL gate. Because for the standard TTL gate, this typical speed power product is equal to 90 picojoules. So of course, the 74H series gates provide the better speed, but they are not efficient in terms of the power. So then after, to improve the speed and the overall efficiency of the gate,  the 74S series came into existence. And this series uses the Schottky transistors. So first, let us briefly understand what is Schottky transistor. And in this 74S series, why the normal bipolar junction transistors were replaced  by the Schottky transistors. So here, if you see the standard TTL logic, or even the 74L and the 74H series, then in this series, the majority of the transistors in the circuit were operating in the saturation. So in the saturation, the excess amount of charge is stored in the base of the transistors. So unless this charge is not removed, the transistor won't go in the OFF state. And that delay in removing the charges from the base of the transistor  limits the speed of the logic gate. So if you see the Schottky transistors, then they use the Schottky barrier diode between the base and the collector of the transistor. So this arrangement does not allow the transistor to go into saturation. And in this way, that eliminates the problem of the excess charge that is stored in the base of the transistor. So here, when the sufficient amount of base current starts flowing through the transistor, then the transistor starts going into saturation. And due to that, this voltage Vc starts reducing. So here, as soon as this collector voltage starts dropping, the Schottky barrier diode will get turned on. And as you know, the forward voltage drop of the Schottky barrier diode is around 0.25 to 0.3V. Because if you are aware, the Schottky barrier diode has the metal semiconductor junction. So once it gets turned on, then the voltage difference between the base and the collector will remain between the 0.25 and the 0.3V. So for example, if the voltage at the base is equal to 0.7V, then the voltage at the collector will be around 0.4V. And hence, in this case, this base-collector junction will not get forward biased. Because as you know, for the transistor to go into saturation, both the base emitter and the collector base junction should get forward biased. But in this case, this collector base junction will not get forward biased. And in this way, the transistor won't go into saturation. So we can say that in this way, the Schottky barrier diode prevents the transistor from going into saturation. So these transistors with the Schottky barrier diode are known as the Schottky transistors. And typically, this is how they are represented. That means this is the symbol of the Schottky transistor. So this 74S series uses this Schottky transistor. And this is the circuit of the 74S series two input NAND gate. And this TTL series is known as the Schottky TTL logic. So as you can see over here, except the one transistor in the Darlington pair, all the transistors have been replaced by the Schottky transistor. And that prevents all the transistors from going into saturation. And due to that, there will be an improvement in the speed. Moreover, compared to the standard 74 series TTL logic, here all the resistor values  have been also reduced. So due to that, the overall current in the circuit will increase. And hence, the capacitive load will charge faster. And due to that, you will also see the improvement in the speed. So apart from that, on the output side for the active pull-up, we also have the Darlington pair. So as we have discussed earlier, when this Darlington pair is in the ON condition, then it offers the very low output impedance. And hence, during the low to high transition, this capacitive load will charge faster. And because of that, there will be an improvement in the speed. So similarly, here for the pull-down also, we have the active element. So if you recall, then in the standard TTL logic, during the pull-down,  we had only resistor over here. And we have seen that, that resistor helps in removing the charge that is stored at the base of the transistor. So in this case, since we have the active element, so it removes the base charge of the transistor even faster. Moreover, here now since all the transistors are the Schottky transistors,  so they won't go into saturation. And because of that, there won't be much base charge compared to the earlier case. So let us understand how this active element in the pull-down network helps in increasing the speed of the logic gate. So in this logic gate, during the low to high transition, this Q4 and Q5 will be in the ON condition. And at that time, this Q6 will go into OFF state. So this Q6 transistor will completely go in the OFF state, when the charge that is  stored at the base of the transistor will get removed. So here, when this Q6 starts going into the OFF state, at that time, this Q3 is already in the ON state. And hence, it provides the lower resistance path for removal of this base charge. And due to that, we will get the faster low to high transition. Apart from that, this transistor Q3 also helps in faster high to low transition. Or in other words, I would say that it helps in turning ON this Q6 transistor during this HIGH to LOW transition. So in the standard TTL gate, we have seen that when this Q2 transistor gets turned ON, then the current through the emitter will get divided in two branches. The one current will flow through the resistor, while the other current will go into the  base of another transistor. But in this case, if you see, then instead of the passive resistor, here we have the active element. So it won't get turned ON until there is sufficient voltage at the base of this Q3. That means until this Q3 gets turned ON, this Q3 transistor will not draw any current. And therefore, this entire current will go into the base of the Q6. And due to that, this Q6 will turn ON faster. So in short, because of this Q3 transistor, this output transistor Q6 can get switched ON and OFF faster. Moreover, here because of this Q3 transistor,  we will also get the sharper voltage transfer characteristic. So this is the voltage transfer characteristic of the standard TTL inverter. So as you can see, during the HIGH to LOW transition, here we have the two slopes. So in this region, only this Q2 transistor will be in the ON condition, while in this region, both Q2 and the output transistor will be in the ON condition. But in this case, we will not have that situation. Because in this case, when the voltage at the base of the Q2 reaches 0.7V at that time, it won't get turned ON. Because unlike the earlier case, here we don't have any passive resistor. So now, to turn ON this transistor Q2, we also need to turn ON either Q3 or the Q6. And for that, we also require the additional VBE. That means here, to turn ON this transistor Q2,  we require the 0.7V plus 0.7V at the base of the Q2. That means when the voltage at the base of the Q2 is around 1.4V at that time,  this Q2 will get turned ON. And at that voltage, this Q6 will also get turned ON. That means in this case, both Q2 and Q6 will get turned ON simultaneously. And due to that, now this curve will get stretched up to the 1.1V. And therefore, now we will have the sharper transition. So these are the advantages that we will get after adding this Q3 transistor. So apart from all these changes compared to the standard TTL version,  here we also have the Schottky diodes at the input side. So these diodes provide the negative voltage protection and it also removes the ringing. So because of all these design changes, we get the improvement in the speed. But due to the lower resistance values, the power consumption will increase. So for the 74S series, the power consumption is around 20 mW, while if you see the speed, then that is around 3 ns. That means compared to the previous versions,  there is a substantial improvement in the speed. And therefore, the speed power product will be equal to 60 pJ. So that is the Schottky TTL logic. So after the 74S series, to reduce the power consumption of the gate, the 74LS series came. And that became quite popular. So this 74LS is the low-power, slower speed version of the 74S series. And here, this LS stands for the low-power Schottky TTL logic. So in this version, the manufacturing technology was also changed. That means in this version, the size of the transistors was also  lesser compared to the earlier version. And because of that, the parasitic capacitance were also reduced. And hence, there was also an increase in the speed. But here, since it is a low-power version of the 74S series, so here,  the value of all the resistors were increased. Apart from that, there are a couple of more changes on the design side. So here, on the input side, instead of the multi-emitter transistor, we have a simple two Schottky diodes. The reason is that the Schottky diode requires a much lesser space compared to the conventional multi-emitter transistor. And the second reason is that, here since we have the Schottky transistors, so they are not going into saturation. And therefore, the charge at the base of these transistors will also be less. So it can easily be removed with the help of these Schottky transistors. And therefore, here these two Schottky diodes are used for the two inputs. So whenever the inputs are low, at that time,  the current will flow through these Schottky diodes. And it will also remove the base charge of this Q1 transistor. That means whenever these inputs are low, then these Schottky diodes will get  turned ON and it won't allow the Q1 to go into ON state. And whenever the inputs are HIGH, at that time, these Schottky diodes will remain in the OFF condition and the Q1 will get turned ON. So that is one of the modifications in this 74LS series. Apart from that, here we also have two more Schottky diodes. So here, this upper Schottky diode helps in removing the base charge of the Q5 when it goes from ON to OFF state. So here, this Schottky diode provides the path for removal of the base charge of the Q5. So when the Q5 goes in the OFF state, at that time, this Q1 will be in the ON condition. So through this path, the base charge of the Q5 will get removed. So that is the purpose of this upper Schottky diode. And this lower Schottky diode provides the additional sink current path through this Q1. So whenever the output goes from the high to low state, at that time, this capacitive load will get discharged through this transistor. But now it will also have the additional path for the discharge through this Schottky diode. And hence, it will also turn OFF faster. And because of that, we will have the faster turn OFF time of the logic gate. So here, due to all these modifications, despite increasing the resistor values, the speed that you are getting is comparable to the standard TTL gates. So of course, here since the resistor values have been increased,  So the power consumption will be low. So for this 74 LS series, the typical power consumption is around 2 mW. While if we see the speed, then that is around 10 ns. That means now the speed power product is equal to 20 pJ. And if we compare it with the standard TTL logic, then that is almost 4 to 5 times lower. So that is the 74 LS series of the TTL gate. So after the 74 LS series, the 74 ALS series came. That is the advanced low-power Schottky TTL logic. So compared to the earlier version of the 74 LS series, this version was using the 3 micron fabrication technology. That means here, the transistor sizes were further reduced. Apart from that, there are a couple of changes in the design, which reduces the power consumption and increases the speed of the logic gate. So the first one if you see, then there is additional transistors over here. So this transistor provides the required base drive for this Q2 transistor. Because now, the emitter current of the Q1 is going as the base current for the Q2. So due to that, now the base current of the Q2 will increase. And due to that, now this Q2 and Q3 will get turned ON faster. And that will improve the switching speed. So apart from that, if we see the second change, then now on the input side,  we have the PNP transistors. So first, let's understand why these transistors were introduced. So here, due to this additional Q1 transistor, to turn ON this Q2 and Q3 transistor, we require the additional voltage of 0.6 to 0.7 V. That is the VBE of the Q1, right? That means due to this additional transistor, the voltage at the base of the Q1 should be at least 3 VBE drop. That is the one VBE, plus the second VBE and the third VBE. So due to this additional transistor, the required input voltage to turn ON this Q2 and Q3 will also increase. But to compensate that, here these PNP transistors were introduced. So here, these transistors are used in the emitter follower configuration. So here, for these PNP transistors, this VBE drop will be negative. That is equal to minus 0.7 V. And due to that,  this additional VBE drop will get eliminated. Because here, we are applying the input at the base of this PNP transistor. So now if we see, then the required input voltage to turn ON this transistor Q2 and Q3 will be equal to minus 0.7 V plus the 3 VBE drop across these 3 transistors. That means here, this additional VBEdrop will get eliminated. And therefore, the required input voltage will almost remain same. So that is the purpose of these PNP transistors. Moreover, here these Schottky diodes were introduced to remove the  base charge of this Q2 transistor. And due to that, it will get turned OFF faster. And finally, since it is a low-power series, so to reduce the power consumption, all the resistor values have been increased. So for this 74 ALS version, the typical power consumption is around 1.2 mW. And if we see the speed, then that is roughly around 4 ns. That means the speed power product is equal to 4.8 pJ. So that is the advanced low-power Schottky TTL logic. So after this 74 ALS series, the 74 AS and the 74 F series came. So these versions are basically a faster version of the 74 ALS series,  which mainly focuses on the speed of the TTL gates. So here, this AS stands for the advanced Schottky TTL logic. So in this version, the typical power consumption is around 8 mW, but the speed of the logic gate is around 1.7 ns, and it is fastest among all TTL versions. So therefore, here the speed power product is around 13.6 pJ. And then this 74 F series is also very similar to the 74 AS series. But this version was developed by the company called Fairchild. So if we see the characteristics of these 74 F series gates, then that is comparable to the 74 AS series. And that is how over the years, the different versions of the TTL came into existence. So still in many applications, these TTL logic ICs are used for the prototyping. But in most of the applications, nowadays, this CMOS logic is used. Because this CMOS logic is very power efficient, and it is also very easy to scale it up. So the issue with the TTL logic is that, it is not easy to scale it up. Because as you know, this TTL logic involves a lot of resistors and transistors. So during the fabrication, this resistor takes a lot of space. And hence, using this TTL logic, it is not possible to design  the very large scale integrated circuits. And that is why over the years, this CMOS logic has replaced the TTL logic. So that's it for this video, and I hope in this video, you understood the different  versions of the TTL logic, and how this logic evolved over the years. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below.

to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will see the subfamily of the ttl logic. and we will see that how the ttl logic evolved over time, and how the different versions of the ttl came into existence. so so far, all the discussion related to the ttl logic, which we have carried out, that was for the standard ttl version, which is often known as the 74 series. so for example, the 7400 is the ic for the standard ttl two input nand gate. and likewise, the 7404 is the ic for the inverter. so after the standard ttl gates, the different versions of the ttl also came. so the main purpose of all these different versions was to either reduce the power consumption or to increase the speed of the ttl gates. so if you see the typical power consumption of the ttl gate, then that is roughly around 10 mw. while if you see the speed or the propagation delay of this logic gate, then that is roughly around 9 to 10 ns. so all the versions that came after the standard ttl gates have either lower power consumption or the higher speed compared to the standard version. so during our discussion, we will take the reference of the standard two input ttl nand gate. and with respect to that, we will see that what modifications were made in the different versions of the ttl. so the first two series, that came after the standard 74 series, were the 74l and 74h. so if you see the 74l series, then that is the low-power ttl logic. so the design wise, it is same as the standard ttl logic. but here, the resistor values were increased. so because of the increase in the resistor values, the current drawn by the circuit will also reduce. and because of that, the power consumption of the logic gate will also reduce. but at the same time, because of the lower current, the capacitive load at the output also charges slower. so if you see the typical power consumption of the 74l series gates, then that is around 1 mw. so as you can see, compared to the standard 74 series version, there is a substantial reduction in the power consumption. but at the same time, the speed will also reduce. so here, the propagation delay is roughly around 33 ns. so that is the 74l series. that is the low-power ttl logic. so then after, to increase the speed of the logic gates, the 74l series came, which is also known as the high-speed ttl logic. so in this version, the values of all the resistors were reduced. and because of the lower resistance values, the current in the circuit increases. and due to the higher current, the capacity load charges faster. and due to that, we will see the increase in the speed of the logic gate. and further, to increase the speed, here on the output side, the darlington pair is used. so as you know, this darlington pair provides the higher current gain. that is roughly equal to β². so when this darlington pair is in the on condition, then due to this higher current, the capacitive load at the output charge is faster. and hence, we will have the faster turn-on time. so if we see the same thing in the other way, then the output resistance of this darlington pair is even lower. so due to this lower resistance, the rc time constant will also reduce. and hence, we will have the faster turn-on time. now here, the purpose of this resistor at the emitter of the q4 is that, when this darlington pair goes in the off condition, then the charge that is stored at the base of this q5 will be removed through this resistor. so in short, because of this darlington pair at the output side, and due to the lower resistance values, the propagation delay of the 74h series gates is lower compared to the standard ttl gates. but due to the higher current, the power dissipation will be more. so here, for the 74h series, the typical power consumption is around 23 mw. while if we see the propagation delay or the speed of the logic gate, then that is roughly around 6 ns. so for any logic gate of any family, the important metric to measure its speed and power efficiency is the speed power product. and as its name suggests, it is the product of the average power that is consumed by the gate and the speed of the gate. so this parameter defines the energy consumed by the logic gate per switching operation. and often it is represented in the picojoules. so the lower value of this parameter indicates the better efficiency of the logic gate. so for the 74h series, if we see the speed power product, then that is around 138 picojoules. and in fact, that is even higher than the standard ttl gate. because for the standard ttl gate, this typical speed power product is equal to 90 picojoules. so of course, the 74h series gates provide the better speed, but they are not efficient in terms of the power. so then after, to improve the speed and the overall efficiency of the gate, the 74s series came into existence. and this series uses the schottky transistors. so first, let us briefly understand what is schottky transistor. and in this 74s series, why the normal bipolar junction transistors were replaced by the schottky transistors. so here, if you see the standard ttl logic, or even the 74l and the 74h series, then in this series, the majority of the transistors in the circuit were operating in the saturation. so in the saturation, the excess amount of charge is stored in the base of the transistors. so unless this charge is not removed, the transistor wont go in the off state. and that delay in removing the charges from the base of the transistor limits the speed of the logic gate. so if you see the schottky transistors, then they use the schottky barrier diode between the base and the collector of the transistor. so this arrangement does not allow the transistor to go into saturation. and in this way, that eliminates the problem of the excess charge that is stored in the base of the transistor. so here, when the sufficient amount of base current starts flowing through the transistor, then the transistor starts going into saturation. and due to that, this voltage vc starts reducing. so here, as soon as this collector voltage starts dropping, the schottky barrier diode will get turned on. and as you know, the forward voltage drop of the schottky barrier diode is around 0.25 to 0.3v. because if you are aware, the schottky barrier diode has the metal semiconductor junction. so once it gets turned on, then the voltage difference between the base and the collector will remain between the 0.25 and the 0.3v. so for example, if the voltage at the base is equal to 0.7v, then the voltage at the collector will be around 0.4v. and hence, in this case, this base-collector junction will not get forward biased. because as you know, for the transistor to go into saturation, both the base emitter and the collector base junction should get forward biased. but in this case, this collector base junction will not get forward biased. and in this way, the transistor wont go into saturation. so we can say that in this way, the schottky barrier diode prevents the transistor from going into saturation. so these transistors with the schottky barrier diode are known as the schottky transistors. and typically, this is how they are represented. that means this is the symbol of the schottky transistor. so this 74s series uses this schottky transistor. and this is the circuit of the 74s series two input nand gate. and this ttl series is known as the schottky ttl logic. so as you can see over here, except the one transistor in the darlington pair, all the transistors have been replaced by the schottky transistor. and that prevents all the transistors from going into saturation. and due to that, there will be an improvement in the speed. moreover, compared to the standard 74 series ttl logic, here all the resistor values have been also reduced. so due to that, the overall current in the circuit will increase. and hence, the capacitive load will charge faster. and due to that, you will also see the improvement in the speed. so apart from that, on the output side for the active pull-up, we also have the darlington pair. so as we have discussed earlier, when this darlington pair is in the on condition, then it offers the very low output impedance. and hence, during the low to high transition, this capacitive load will charge faster. and because of that, there will be an improvement in the speed. so similarly, here for the pull-down also, we have the active element. so if you recall, then in the standard ttl logic, during the pull-down, we had only resistor over here. and we have seen that, that resistor helps in removing the charge that is stored at the base of the transistor. so in this case, since we have the active element, so it removes the base charge of the transistor even faster. moreover, here now since all the transistors are the schottky transistors, so they wont go into saturation. and because of that, there wont be much base charge compared to the earlier case. so let us understand how this active element in the pull-down network helps in increasing the speed of the logic gate. so in this logic gate, during the low to high transition, this q4 and q5 will be in the on condition. and at that time, this q6 will go into off state. so this q6 transistor will completely go in the off state, when the charge that is stored at the base of the transistor will get removed. so here, when this q6 starts going into the off state, at that time, this q3 is already in the on state. and hence, it provides the lower resistance path for removal of this base charge. and due to that, we will get the faster low to high transition. apart from that, this transistor q3 also helps in faster high to low transition. or in other words, i would say that it helps in turning on this q6 transistor during this high to low transition. so in the standard ttl gate, we have seen that when this q2 transistor gets turned on, then the current through the emitter will get divided in two branches. the one current will flow through the resistor, while the other current will go into the base of another transistor. but in this case, if you see, then instead of the passive resistor, here we have the active element. so it wont get turned on until there is sufficient voltage at the base of this q3. that means until this q3 gets turned on, this q3 transistor will not draw any current. and therefore, this entire current will go into the base of the q6. and due to that, this q6 will turn on faster. so in short, because of this q3 transistor, this output transistor q6 can get switched on and off faster. moreover, here because of this q3 transistor, we will also get the sharper voltage transfer characteristic. so this is the voltage transfer characteristic of the standard ttl inverter. so as you can see, during the high to low transition, here we have the two slopes. so in this region, only this q2 transistor will be in the on condition, while in this region, both q2 and the output transistor will be in the on condition. but in this case, we will not have that situation. because in this case, when the voltage at the base of the q2 reaches 0.7v at that time, it wont get turned on. because unlike the earlier case, here we dont have any passive resistor. so now, to turn on this transistor q2, we also need to turn on either q3 or the q6. and for that, we also require the additional vbe. that means here, to turn on this transistor q2, we require the 0.7v plus 0.7v at the base of the q2. that means when the voltage at the base of the q2 is around 1.4v at that time, this q2 will get turned on. and at that voltage, this q6 will also get turned on. that means in this case, both q2 and q6 will get turned on simultaneously. and due to that, now this curve will get stretched up to the 1.1v. and therefore, now we will have the sharper transition. so these are the advantages that we will get after adding this q3 transistor. so apart from all these changes compared to the standard ttl version, here we also have the schottky diodes at the input side. so these diodes provide the negative voltage protection and it also removes the ringing. so because of all these design changes, we get the improvement in the speed. but due to the lower resistance values, the power consumption will increase. so for the 74s series, the power consumption is around 20 mw, while if you see the speed, then that is around 3 ns. that means compared to the previous versions, there is a substantial improvement in the speed. and therefore, the speed power product will be equal to 60 pj. so that is the schottky ttl logic. so after the 74s series, to reduce the power consumption of the gate, the 74ls series came. and that became quite popular. so this 74ls is the low-power, slower speed version of the 74s series. and here, this ls stands for the low-power schottky ttl logic. so in this version, the manufacturing technology was also changed. that means in this version, the size of the transistors was also lesser compared to the earlier version. and because of that, the parasitic capacitance were also reduced. and hence, there was also an increase in the speed. but here, since it is a low-power version of the 74s series, so here, the value of all the resistors were increased. apart from that, there are a couple of more changes on the design side. so here, on the input side, instead of the multi-emitter transistor, we have a simple two schottky diodes. the reason is that the schottky diode requires a much lesser space compared to the conventional multi-emitter transistor. and the second reason is that, here since we have the schottky transistors, so they are not going into saturation. and therefore, the charge at the base of these transistors will also be less. so it can easily be removed with the help of these schottky transistors. and therefore, here these two schottky diodes are used for the two inputs. so whenever the inputs are low, at that time, the current will flow through these schottky diodes. and it will also remove the base charge of this q1 transistor. that means whenever these inputs are low, then these schottky diodes will get turned on and it wont allow the q1 to go into on state. and whenever the inputs are high, at that time, these schottky diodes will remain in the off condition and the q1 will get turned on. so that is one of the modifications in this 74ls series. apart from that, here we also have two more schottky diodes. so here, this upper schottky diode helps in removing the base charge of the q5 when it goes from on to off state. so here, this schottky diode provides the path for removal of the base charge of the q5. so when the q5 goes in the off state, at that time, this q1 will be in the on condition. so through this path, the base charge of the q5 will get removed. so that is the purpose of this upper schottky diode. and this lower schottky diode provides the additional sink current path through this q1. so whenever the output goes from the high to low state, at that time, this capacitive load will get discharged through this transistor. but now it will also have the additional path for the discharge through this schottky diode. and hence, it will also turn off faster. and because of that, we will have the faster turn off time of the logic gate. so here, due to all these modifications, despite increasing the resistor values, the speed that you are getting is comparable to the standard ttl gates. so of course, here since the resistor values have been increased, so the power consumption will be low. so for this 74 ls series, the typical power consumption is around 2 mw. while if we see the speed, then that is around 10 ns. that means now the speed power product is equal to 20 pj. and if we compare it with the standard ttl logic, then that is almost 4 to 5 times lower. so that is the 74 ls series of the ttl gate. so after the 74 ls series, the 74 als series came. that is the advanced low-power schottky ttl logic. so compared to the earlier version of the 74 ls series, this version was using the 3 micron fabrication technology. that means here, the transistor sizes were further reduced. apart from that, there are a couple of changes in the design, which reduces the power consumption and increases the speed of the logic gate. so the first one if you see, then there is additional transistors over here. so this transistor provides the required base drive for this q2 transistor. because now, the emitter current of the q1 is going as the base current for the q2. so due to that, now the base current of the q2 will increase. and due to that, now this q2 and q3 will get turned on faster. and that will improve the switching speed. so apart from that, if we see the second change, then now on the input side, we have the pnp transistors. so first, lets understand why these transistors were introduced. so here, due to this additional q1 transistor, to turn on this q2 and q3 transistor, we require the additional voltage of 0.6 to 0.7 v. that is the vbe of the q1, right? that means due to this additional transistor, the voltage at the base of the q1 should be at least 3 vbe drop. that is the one vbe, plus the second vbe and the third vbe. so due to this additional transistor, the required input voltage to turn on this q2 and q3 will also increase. but to compensate that, here these pnp transistors were introduced. so here, these transistors are used in the emitter follower configuration. so here, for these pnp transistors, this vbe drop will be negative. that is equal to minus 0.7 v. and due to that, this additional vbe drop will get eliminated. because here, we are applying the input at the base of this pnp transistor. so now if we see, then the required input voltage to turn on this transistor q2 and q3 will be equal to minus 0.7 v plus the 3 vbe drop across these 3 transistors. that means here, this additional vbedrop will get eliminated. and therefore, the required input voltage will almost remain same. so that is the purpose of these pnp transistors. moreover, here these schottky diodes were introduced to remove the base charge of this q2 transistor. and due to that, it will get turned off faster. and finally, since it is a low-power series, so to reduce the power consumption, all the resistor values have been increased. so for this 74 als version, the typical power consumption is around 1.2 mw. and if we see the speed, then that is roughly around 4 ns. that means the speed power product is equal to 4.8 pj. so that is the advanced low-power schottky ttl logic. so after this 74 als series, the 74 as and the 74 f series came. so these versions are basically a faster version of the 74 als series, which mainly focuses on the speed of the ttl gates. so here, this as stands for the advanced schottky ttl logic. so in this version, the typical power consumption is around 8 mw, but the speed of the logic gate is around 1.7 ns, and it is fastest among all ttl versions. so therefore, here the speed power product is around 13.6 pj. and then this 74 f series is also very similar to the 74 as series. but this version was developed by the company called fairchild. so if we see the characteristics of these 74 f series gates, then that is comparable to the 74 as series. and that is how over the years, the different versions of the ttl came into existence. so still in many applications, these ttl logic ics are used for the prototyping. but in most of the applications, nowadays, this cmos logic is used. because this cmos logic is very power efficient, and it is also very easy to scale it up. so the issue with the ttl logic is that, it is not easy to scale it up. because as you know, this ttl logic involves a lot of resistors and transistors. so during the fabrication, this resistor takes a lot of space. and hence, using this ttl logic, it is not possible to design the very large scale integrated circuits. and that is why over the years, this cmos logic has replaced the ttl logic. so thats it for this video, and i hope in this video, you understood the different versions of the ttl logic, and how this logic evolved over the years. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe the channel for more such videos.","ttl sub families schottky ttl 74 s series, low power schottky ttl

roughly around 33 ns. so that is the 74l series. that is the low-power ttl logic. so then after, to increase the speed of the logic gates, the 74l series came, which is also known as the high-speed

and due to the lower resistance values, the propagation delay of the 74h series gates is lower compared to the standard ttl gates. but due to the higher current, the power dissipation will be more. so here, for the 74h series, the typical power consumption is around 23 mw. while if we see the propagation delay or the speed of the logic gate, then that is roughly around 6 ns. so for any logic gate

the power. so then after, to improve the speed and the overall efficiency of the gate, the 74s series came into existence. and this series uses the schottky transistors. so first, let us briefly understand what is schottky transistor. and in this 74s series, why the normal bipolar junction transistors were replaced by the schottky transistors. so here, if you see the standard ttl logic, or

this is the circuit of the 74s series two input nand gate. and this ttl series is known as the schottky ttl logic. so as you can see over here, except the one transistor in the darlington pair, all the transistors have been replaced by the schottky transistor. and that prevents all the transistors from going into saturation. and due to that, there will be an improvement in the speed. moreover, compared to the standard 74 series ttl logic, here all the resistor values have been also reduced. so due to that, the overall current in the circuit will increase. and hence, the capacitive load will charge faster. and due to that, you will also see the improvement in the speed. so apart from that, on the output side for the active pull-up, we also have the darlington pair. so as we have discussed earlier, when this darlington pair is in the on condition, then it offers the very low output impedance. and hence, during the low to high transition, this capacitive load will charge faster. and because of that, there will be an improvement in the speed. so similarly, here for the pull-down also, we have the active element. so if you recall, then in the standard ttl logic, during the pull-down, we had only resistor over here. and we have seen that, that resistor helps in removing the charge that is stored at the base of the transistor. so in this case, since we have the active element, so it removes the base charge of the transistor even faster. moreover, here now since all the transistors are the schottky transistors, so they wont go into saturation. and because of that, there wont be much base charge compared to the earlier case. so let us understand how this active element in the pull-down network helps in increasing the speed of the logic gate. so in this logic gate, during the low to high transition, this q4 and q5 will be in the on condition. and at that time, this q6 will go into off state. so this q6 transistor will completely go in the off state, when the charge that is stored at the base of the transistor will get removed. so here, when this q6 starts going into the off state, at that time, this q3 is already in the on state. and hence, it provides the lower resistance path for removal of this base charge. and due to that, we will get the faster low to high transition. apart from that, this transistor q3 also helps in faster high to low transition. or in other words, i would say that it helps in turning on this q6 transistor during this high to low transition. so in the standard ttl gate, we have seen that when this q2 transistor gets turned on, then the current through the emitter will get divided in two branches. the one current will flow through the resistor, while the other current will go into the base of another transistor. but in this case, if you see, then instead of the passive resistor, here we have the active element. so it wont get turned on until there is sufficient voltage at the base of this q3. that means until this q3 gets turned on, this q3 transistor will not draw any current. and therefore, this entire current will go into the base of the q6. and due to that, this q6 will turn on faster. so in short, because of this q3 transistor, this output transistor q6 can get switched on and off faster. moreover, here because of this q3 transistor, we will also get the sharper voltage transfer characteristic. so this is the voltage transfer characteristic of the standard ttl inverter. so as you can see, during the high to low transition, here we have the two slopes. so in this region, only this q2 transistor will be in the on condition, while in this region, both q2 and the output transistor will be in the on condition. but in this case, we will not have that situation. because in this case, when the voltage at the base of the q2 reaches 0.7v at that time, it wont get turned on. because unlike the earlier case, here we dont have any passive resistor. so now, to turn on this transistor q2, we also need to turn on either q3 or the q6. and for that, we also require the additional vbe. that means here, to turn on this transistor q2, we require the 0.7v plus 0.7v at the base of the q2. that means when the voltage at the base of the q2 is around 1.4v at that time, this q2 will get turned on. and at that voltage, this q6 will also get turned on. that means in this case, both q2 and q6 will get turned on simultaneously. and due to that, now this curve will get stretched up to the 1.1v. and therefore, now we will have the sharper transition. so these are the advantages that we will get after adding this q3 transistor. so apart from all these changes compared to the standard ttl version, here we also have the schottky diodes at the input side. so these diodes provide the negative voltage protection and it also removes the ringing. so because of all these design changes, we get the improvement in the speed. but due to the lower resistance values, the power consumption will increase. so for the 74s series, the power consumption is around 20 mw, while if you see the speed, then that is around 3 ns. that means compared to the previous versions, there is a substantial improvement in the speed. and therefore, the speed power product will be equal to 60 pj. so that is the schottky ttl logic. so after the 74s series, to reduce the power consumption of the gate, the 74ls series came. and that became quite popular. so this 74ls is the low-power, slower speed version of the 74s series. and here, this ls stands for the low-power schottky ttl logic. so in this version, the manufacturing technology was also changed. that means in this version, the size of the transistors was also lesser compared to the earlier version. and because of that, the parasitic capacitance were also reduced. and hence, there was also an increase in the speed. but here, since it is a low-power version of the 74s series, so here, the value of all the resistors were increased. apart from that, there are a couple of more changes on the design side. so here, on the input side, instead of the multi-emitter transistor, we have a simple two schottky diodes. the reason is that the schottky diode requires a much lesser space compared to the conventional multi-emitter transistor. and the second reason is that, here since we have the schottky transistors, so they are not going into saturation. and therefore, the charge at the base of these transistors will also be less. so it can easily be removed with the help of these schottky transistors. and therefore, here these two schottky diodes are used for the two inputs. so whenever the inputs are low, at that time, the current will flow through these schottky diodes. and it will also remove the base charge of this q1 transistor. that means whenever these inputs are low, then these schottky diodes will get turned on and it wont allow the q1 to go into on state. and whenever the inputs are high, at that time, these schottky diodes will remain in the off condition and the q1 will get turned on. so that is one of the modifications in this 74ls series. apart from that, here we also have two more schottky diodes. so here, this upper schottky diode helps in removing the base charge of the q5 when it goes from on to off state. so here, this schottky diode provides the path for removal of the base charge of the q5. so when the q5 goes in the off state, at that time, this q1 will be in the on condition. so through this path, the base charge of the q5 will get removed. so that is the purpose of this upper schottky diode. and this lower schottky diode provides the additional sink current path through this q1. so whenever the output goes from the high to low state, at that time, this capacitive load will get discharged through this transistor. but now it will also have the additional path for the discharge through this schottky diode. and hence, it will also turn off faster. and because of that, we will have the faster turn off time of the logic gate. so here, due to all these modifications, despite increasing the resistor values, the speed that you are getting is comparable to the standard ttl gates. so of course, here since the resistor values have been increased, so the power consumption will be low. so for this 74 ls series, the typical power consumption is around 2 mw. while if we see the speed, then that is around 10 ns. that means now the speed power product is equal to 20 pj. and if we compare it with the standard ttl logic, then that is almost 4 to 5 times lower. so that is the 74 ls series of the ttl gate. so after the 74 ls series, the 74 als series came. that is the advanced low-power schottky ttl logic. so compared to the earlier version of the 74 ls series, this version was using the 3 micron fabrication technology. that means here, the transistor sizes were further reduced. apart from that, there are a couple of changes in the design, which reduces the power consumption and increases the speed of the logic gate. so the first one if you see, then there is additional transistors over here. so this transistor provides the required base drive for this q2 transistor. because now, the emitter current of the q1 is going as the base current for the q2. so due to that, now the base current of the q2 will increase. and due to that, now this q2 and q3 will get turned on faster. and that will improve the switching speed. so apart from that, if we see the second change, then now on the input side, we have the pnp transistors. so first, lets understand why these transistors were introduced. so here, due to this additional q1 transistor, to turn on this q2 and q3 transistor, we require the additional voltage of 0.6 to 0.7 v. that is the vbe of the q1, right? that means due to this additional transistor, the voltage at the base of the q1 should be at least 3 vbe drop. that is the one vbe, plus the second vbe and the third vbe. so due to this additional transistor, the required input voltage to turn on this q2 and q3 will also increase. but to compensate that, here these pnp transistors were introduced. so here, these transistors are used in the emitter follower configuration. so here, for these pnp transistors, this vbe drop will be negative. that is equal to minus 0.7 v. and due to that, this additional vbe drop will get eliminated. because here, we are applying the input at the base of this pnp transistor. so now if we see, then the required input voltage to turn on this transistor q2 and q3 will be equal to minus 0.7 v plus the 3 vbe drop across these 3 transistors. that means here, this additional vbedrop will get eliminated. and therefore, the required input voltage will almost remain same. so that is the purpose of these pnp transistors. moreover, here these schottky diodes were introduced to remove the base charge of this q2 transistor. and due to that, it will get turned off faster. and finally, since it is a low-power series, so to reduce the power consumption, all the resistor values have been increased. so for this 74 als version, the typical power consumption is around 1.2 mw. and if we see the speed, then that is roughly around 4 ns. that means the speed power product is equal to 4.8 pj. so that is the advanced low-power schottky ttl logic. so after this 74 als series, the 74 as and the 74 f series came. so these versions are basically a faster version of the 74 als series, which mainly focuses on the speed of the ttl gates. so here, this as stands for the advanced schottky ttl logic. so in this version, the typical power consumption is around 8 mw, but the speed of the logic gate is around 1.7 ns, and it is fastest among all ttl versions. so therefore, here the speed power product is around 13.6 pj. and then this 74 f series is also very similar to the 74 as series. but this version was developed by the company called fairchild. so if we see the characteristics of these 74 f series gates, then that is comparable to the 74 as series. and that is how over the years, the different versions of the ttl came into existence. so still in many applications, these ttl logic ics are used for the prototyping. but in most of the applications, nowadays, this cmos logic is used. because this cmos logic is very power efficient, and it is also very easy to scale it up. so the issue with the ttl logic is that, it is not easy to scale it up. because as you know, this ttl logic involves a lot of resistors and transistors. so during the fabrication, this resistor takes a lot of space. and hence, using this ttl logic, it is not possible to design the very large scale integrated circuits. and that is why over the years, this cmos logic has replaced the ttl logic. so thats it for this video, and i hope in this video, you understood the different versions of the ttl logic, and how this logic evolved over the years. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me

OF5QgmKb6f8,TTL Open Collector gates and Tri-State TTL gates Explained,2025-02-01 07:32:42+00:00,2025,2,Saturday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the open-character TTL gates and Tri-state gates. So in the past couple of videos, we have seen the internal circuit of the TTL inverter,  NAND gate as well as the NOR gate. Now in all these circuits, if you have observed the last stage,  then that was the totem pole stage. So the advantage of this totem pole stage is that it offers the fast switching speed. Because in this totem pole stage, this upper transistor provides the active pull-up  whenever it is in the ON condition. And during the ON condition, it offers the very low resistance. And because of that, it is able to drive the other TTL stages faster and hence it offers the fast switching speed. And the same is the case for the lower transistor. That means in the ON condition, it provides the active pull-down  and it offers the lower resistance. And because of that, it offers the faster switching speed. So that is the advantage of the totem pole stage as the output stage in the TTL gates. But the issue with the totem pole stage is that in the high condition,  the output voltage does not go beyond the 3.6V. And the second issue is that, the output of the totem pole stages  cannot be connected together. And in a way, it is not possible to perform the wired-AND operation. So what is wired-AND operation, I have already covered it in the separate video. So for more information, you can check this video. But here, first let us understand why the totem pole outputs cannot be connected together. So here, let's say, we have two TTL logic gates with the totem pole outputs, and their outputs are connected together. Now when we connect the outputs of the totem pole stages together,  then the main issue arises when both the outputs are at the different logic level. So here, let's say, the one output is at the logic low,  while the other output is at the logic high. So in this TTL gate, since the output is the logic low, so this Q4 transistor will be in the ON condition. While if we see the Q3 transistor, then that will remain in the OFF condition. While for this second TTL gate, since the output is HIGH, so this Q4 will remain in the OFF condition, while the Q3 will remain in the ON condition. And when we connect these outputs together, then what will happen, this Q3 transistor will try to pull up the output voltage of this node, while this Q4 transistor will try to bring down the output voltage to the logic LOW. And since both are the active elements, so both transistors will fight to set the output voltage to either logic LOW or logic HIGH. And here, since the Q4 is offering the lower resistance path, so effectively,  we will have the short circuit. And because of that, there is a chance of high flow of current  between this Q3 and the Q4 transistor. And because of that, both the logic gates can get damaged. So to avoid that, these totem pole outputs are not connected together. And because of that, there is no way we can achieve the wired-AND logic  in these TTL gates with the totem pole outputs. But in these open collector TTL gates, it is possible to perform the wired-AND logic. So as its name suggests, here the collector of this transistor Q4 is kept in the open condition. So if you see the earlier case of the totem pole output, then above this collector terminal, there was a diode and the transistor. But here in this open collector case, this collector terminal is kept open. And here, the output is taken through this collector terminal. So typically, in these open collector gates, the external pull-up resistor is connected at the collector terminal. So here, when this Q4 is in the ON condition, then it operates in the saturation and  this VCE is close to 0.2 V. So because of that, the output of this gate will be logic LOW. And similarly, when this Q4 is in the OFF condition, then the voltage at the output is close to VCC. Because here, this output node is connected to the VCC via this pull-up resistor. And in this way, the output will be logic HIGH. Moreover, in this logic HIGH condition, the output will also be close to VCC. So here, the need of the pull-up resistor is that, when the Q4 is in the OFF condition, then the voltage at the collector of this transistor will not be sufficient  to be considered as the logic HIGH. So that is why we need the external pull-up resistor. And with this external pull-up resistor, it is possible to perform the wired AND logic. That means when we connect the outputs of these open collector gates together, then the overall output is the logic AND operation of all the outputs. That means here, if any one of the outputs is LOW,  then the overall output will be logic LOW. And the overall output will be logic HIGH, when all the outputs are HIGH. So first, let us see, why is it possible to connect the outputs of the open collector gates together and then we will see that how it performs the wired AND operation. So here, we have two TTL inverters with the open collector outputs. And here, the output of one TTL gate is LOW, while the output of the other one is HIGH. And let's say, their outputs are connected together. So here, for the first logic gate, since the output is LOW, so this Q4 transistor will operate in the ON condition. And similarly, for the second TTL gate, since the output is HIGH,  it means that its Q4 transistor will be in the OFF condition. So here, this Q4 transistor will try to pull down the output voltage at this node to the logic LOW. So here if you see, then on the other side, we have only passive element. So unlike the totem pole stage, we do not have any active component which can fight to pull the output voltage of this node to the logic HIGH. And therefore, the output voltage at this node will get pulled down to logic zero. And effectively, now the output of these connected logic gates will be equal to logic LOW. That means in case of the open collector gates, since we have the passive pull-up network, so it is possible to connect the outputs together. And those output connections will effectively behave as the wired AND logic. Because here, if any one of the outputs is LOW, then the overall output of that node  will be LOW, and it will become HIGH when all the outputs are logic HIGH. So that is how, when the open collector outputs of these TTL gates are connected together, then that performs the wired AND logic. So again, for more in-depth explanation, you can check this video. So that is the advantage of the open collector gates. But the issue with this open collector gate is that, because of this external pull-up resistor, or basically, due to this passive pull-up, the switching speed will be lesser compared to the totem pole stage. And hence, the propagation delay of these logic gates will be more. So one can argue that, what if we reduce the value of this pull-up resistor and make it comparable to the resistance value, which is equivalent to the resistance offered by  the active pull-up. So let's see what happens. So here if you observe, when the overall output is equal to logic LOW,  then for this logic gate, the current will flow through this path. Moreover, the current through this pull-up resistor will also flow through this Q4 transistor. So here, if the value of the pull-up resistor is very much low, then the total current that is flowing through this Q4 transistor might become more than  the IOL(max) limit of this TTL gate. And because of that, it can damage the transistors. Moreover, the same thing can also happen when we connect the output of this  open collector gate to the input of the TTL gates. So for example, if the output of this open collector gate is LOW, at that time,  the current will flow through this Q4 transistor via this pull-up resistor. And moreover, this IIL current of this connected gate will also flow through this transistor. So if the value of this pull-up resistor is too low, then again, the total current that is flowing through this Q4 transistor will become more than the IOL(max) limit. So again, if you want to calculate what should be the minimum and maximum value of the pull-up resistor, then I have already explained that in one of the earlier videos of the pull-up resistor. So for more information, you can check that video. But in short, that is why it is not possible to reduce the value of the pull-up resistor beyond the certain value. And that is why the propagation delay of these open collector gates  will be more than the totem pole stage. Alright, so far, we have seen the TTL gates with the totem pole output and the open collector output. So now, let's talk about the tri-state TTL gates. So if you see any standard logic gates, then it has only two states. That is logic HIGH and logic LOW. But these tri-state TTL gates have the three outputs. That is logic LOW, logic HIGH and the high impedance state. So for that, these tri-state gates have the one more input. That is the control input. So let's say, this data input is equal to x, while this control input is equal to enable input. So whenever this enable input is LOW, at that time, the output is in the high impedance mode. That means here, the output and input are not connected with each other. And in this condition, we can say that the output of this tri-state gate is  in the high impedance mode. And now whenever this enable input is made to logic 1, then this gate will behave as the normal gate. And in that condition, depending on the input, he will get the output. So in case of this tri-state inverter, when the enable input is HIGH, then it will behave as the normal inverter. So here in this inverter, when the input is LOW, then the output will be logic HIGH. And similarly, when the input is HIGH, then at the output, we will get the logic LOW. So now, let's see the circuit of the tri-state TTL inverter and let's understand  the working of this circuit. So if you see the circuit of this tri-state TTL inverter, then it is similar to the normal TTL inverter except the couple of changes. So here, since we have the two inputs, that is the data input and the enable input, so the current driving stage of this TTL inverter is now a multi-emitter transistor. And the second change is that, now at the base of the Q3, we have one more diode. So here, the cathode of this diode is connected to the enable input, while the anode is connected to the base of the Q3. So now, let's see how this circuit works. So we know that, for the multi-emitter transistor, when any one of the input is low, then the base emitter junction will get forward biased. And because of that, this Q2 and Q4 transistor will remain in the OFF condition. So here, when this enable input is LOW, then the same thing happens. That means here, the base emitter junction of the Q1 will get forward biased. And because of that, the voltage at the base of the Q1 will be around 0.9V. And because of that, the voltage at the collector will be roughly equal to 0.3V. So because of this voltage, both Q2 and Q4 will remain in the OFF condition. And now, the voltage at the base of the Q3 or at the anode of this diode will be close to Vcc. But here, since the enable input is low, so this diode will get forward biased. And hence, now the voltage at the base of the Q3 will be roughly equal to 0.7V. And this voltage will not be sufficient to turn this transistor Q3 in the ON condition. Because here, for that, we at least require the 1.4V at the base of this transistor Q3. And in this condition, this Q3 will also remain in the OFF condition. So we can say that when the enable input is LOW, at that time,  both Q3 and Q4 are in the OFF condition. And therefore, the output of this TTL gate is in the high impedance mode. Now whenever this enable input is HIGH, at that time,  the output of the logic gate depends on this A input. So whenever this enable input is logic HIGH, then first, this diode will get reverse biased. Because now, the voltage at the cathode of this diode is close to 5V. And therefore, it will remain in the OFF condition. And therefore, now this circuit will work as the normal inverter. That means now, when this A input is LOW, then the output will be equal to logic HIGH and it is close to 3.6V. And similarly, when the A input is HIGH, at that time, the output will be equal to logic LOW. And in that condition, that is close to 0.2V. And in this way, this circuit works as the tri-state inverter. So I hope in this video, you understood the working of these open collector TTL gates and the tri-state gates.

about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the open-character ttl gates and tri-state gates. so in the past couple of videos, we have seen the internal circuit of the ttl inverter, nand gate as well as the nor gate. now in all these circuits, if you have observed the last stage, then that was the totem pole stage. so the advantage of this totem pole stage is that it offers the fast switching speed. because in this totem pole stage, this upper transistor provides the active pull-up whenever it is in the on condition. and during the on condition, it offers the very low resistance. and because of that, it is able to drive the other ttl stages faster and hence it offers the fast switching speed. and the same is the case for the lower transistor. that means in the on condition, it provides the active pull-down and it offers the lower resistance. and because of that, it offers the faster switching speed. so that is the advantage of the totem pole stage as the output stage in the ttl gates. but the issue with the totem pole stage is that in the high condition, the output voltage does not go beyond the 3.6v. and the second issue is that, the output of the totem pole stages

condition. so here, when this enable input is low, then the same thing happens. that means here, the base emitter junction of the q1 will get forward biased. and because of that, the voltage at the base of the q1 will be around 0.9v. and because of that, the voltage at the collector will be roughly equal to 0.3v. so because of this voltage, both q2 and q4 will remain in the off condition. and now, the voltage at the base of the q3 or at the anode of this diode will be close to vcc. but here, since the enable input is low, so this diode will get forward biased. and hence, now the voltage at the base of the q3 will be roughly equal to 0.7v. and this voltage will not be sufficient to turn this transistor q3 in the on condition. because here, for that, we at least require the 1.4v at the base of this transistor q3. and in this condition, this q3 will also remain in the off condition. so we can say that when the enable input is low, at that time, both q3 and q4 are in the off condition. and therefore, the output of this ttl gate is in the high impedance mode. now whenever this enable input is high, at that time, the output of the logic gate depends on this a input. so whenever this enable input is logic high, then first, this diode will get reverse biased. because now, the voltage at the cathode of this diode is close to 5v. and therefore, it will remain in the off condition. and therefore, now this circuit will work as the normal inverter. that means now, when this a input is low, then the output will be equal to logic high and it is close to 3.6v. and similarly, when the a input is high, at that time, the output will be equal to logic low. and in that condition, that is close to 0.2v. and in this way, this circuit works as the tri-state inverter.

sDn2hi5ndCA,TTL Logic: TTL NAND and NOR gates Explained,2025-01-23 18:15:35+00:00,2025,1,Thursday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in the previous video, we have seen the internal circuit of the inverter. And based on this circuit, we have also seen the voltage transfer characteristic of this inverter. So, similarly, in this video, let us see the internal circuit of the NAND gate as well as the NOR gate. And first, let us see the internal circuit of the NAND gate. So if you see the circuit of the NAND gate, then it is very similar to the inverter circuit. But here, the first transistor is the multi-emitter transistor. So as its name suggests, this multi-emitter transistor has the two emitter terminals. That means suppose, if we have two transistors, and for these two transistors,  if the base and collectors are connected together, then the two emitter terminals  will behave as the multi-emitter transistor. But in the actual circuits, instead of having the two separate transistors, we have the single transistor, and the base and the collector terminals are common. But it will have the two emitter terminals. So in this TTL NAND gate, depending on the required number of inputs,  this multi-emitter transistor is used. So here, this circuit is the example of the two input NAND gate. So now, let's see the working of the given circuit. So earlier, we have seen that in this TTL logic circuit,  the first stage is the current steering stage. So based on the input, the current goes either on the input side, or it goes towards the next stage. So whenever this base-emitter junction is forward biased,  then the current will go towards the input side. So we can say that whenever the input is low,  then most of the current will flow towards the input side. And whenever the input is high, then this base-emitter junction will get reversed biased, and most of the current will go towards the next stage. So in this multi-emitter transistor, if any one of the inputs is low,  then also this base-emitter junction will get forward biased. And in that condition, most of the current will flow through that specific input. So whenever we will take the different input combinations of this A and B at that time, we will discuss about it in more detail. So here, for the two inputs, we will have total four input combinations. And if we see the truth table of the NAND gate, then this is how it will look like. That means whenever any one of the inputs to the NAND gate is zero, at that time,  the output is logic HIGH. And whenever both inputs are HIGH, at that time only, the output of the gate is LOW. So now, let's see how this circuit works as the NAND gate. And for that, let's consider the case when both inputs A and B are zero. So here, let's assume that the voltage at both input terminals is roughly equal to 0.2V. So here, with this voltage, both base-emitter junctions of the Q1 will get forward biased. And therefore, the voltage over here will be roughly equal to 0.9V. And with this voltage, the collector base junction of the Q1 will also get forward biased. That means here, the voltage around here will be roughly equal to 0.3V. So with this voltage, the base-emitter junction of the Q2 will not get forward biased. And therefore, the Q2 will remain in the OFF condition. And since the Q2 is in the OFF condition, so the Q4 will also remain in the OFF condition. And since the Q2 and Q4 are in the OFF condition, so they hardly draw any current. That means here, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to Vcc. Or in this case, that is roughly equal to 5V. And with this voltage, the base-emitter junction of the Q3 will get forward biased. And if we see the voltage at the output, then that is equal to 5 minus the drop across the VBE of the Q3, minus the drop across the diode. That is equal to 5 minus 1.4V. That is equal to 3.6V. And this output voltage can be considered as the logic HIGH. So we can say that when both inputs are zero, at that time,  the output of this NAND gate is equal to logic HIGH. So similarly, now let's take another extreme case, when both inputs A and B are HIGH. So in this condition, let's say the voltage at both input terminals is roughly equal to 3.6V. So in the earlier video of the TTL inverter, we have seen that when the input voltage is more than 1.5V, then this Q2 and Q4 will get forward biased,  and they will remain in the ON condition. And if we go beyond the 1.5V, then both Q2 and Q4 will operate in the saturation. That means in this condition, if we see this voltage drop, or the VBE, then that is roughly equal to 0.75V. And due to that, the voltage at this node is roughly equal to 1.5V. So due to this, the voltage at the base of the Q1 will not go beyond the 2.1V. So in this condition, the base emitter junction of the Q1 will get reverse biased, while the collector base junction will get forward biased. And therefore, this Q1 will operate in the reverse active region. So in this condition, since the Q4 is operating in the saturation, so the output voltage is roughly equal to 0.2V. And since Q2 is also operating in the saturation, so the voltage at this node,  or at the base of the Q3 will not be sufficient to turn this transistor Q3 in the ON condition. And therefore, this Q3 will remain in the OFF condition. That means we can say that, when both the inputs are HIGH, at that time, the output of this TTL NAND gate is equal to logic LOW, that is roughly equal to 0.2V. So similarly, let's see the case where one of the inputs is logic 0, while the other input is HIGH. So here, we will take the second case, where this A input is logic LOW, while the B input is HIGH. So let's say, one of the inputs is at 0.2V, while the other input is at 3.6V. So as I said earlier, in this multi-emitter transistor, when any one of the inputs is LOW, then the base emitter junction will get forward biased. Let's see why. So here, through this resistor R1, the Vcc is connected to the base of the Q1. And here, since A is LOW, so due to that, this base emitter junction will get forward biased. So in that condition, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is equal to 0.9V. And with this base voltage, the second base emitter junction will not get forward biased. Because here, the voltage at one end is equal to 0.9V,  while the voltage at the other end is equal to 3.6V. And due to that, this base emitter junction will not get forward biased. But here, since one of the base emitter junction is already forward biased,  so the current will flow through that input. And due to that, if we see the voltage at this end, then that is roughly equal to 0.3V. So because of this voltage, both Q2 and Q4 will remain in the OFF condition. And since they are in the OFF condition, so there is hardly any flow of current through the emitter of the Q2. So we can say that the voltage at the base of the Q3 is roughly equal to Vcc. So due to that, Q3 will go in the ON condition, and the output voltage is roughly equal to 3.6V, that is 5 - 1.4V. So we can say that in that condition, the output of the TTL NAND gate will be logic-HIGH. So we can say that when any one of the inputs to the NAND gate is LOW, at that time, the output is equal to logic-HIGH. And the same can also be seen for another input combination. So that is how this circuit will work as the TTL NAND gate. So similarly, now let's see the internal circuit of the two inputs NOR gate, and let's understand how this circuit works as the NOR gate. So here, if you see the circuit of the TTL NOR gate, then here, for the two inputs, we have the separate current-steering stages. So here, this part is the current-steering stage for the A input, while the second part is the current-steering stage for the B input. And here, the collector of the Q1 is going into the base of the Q3. That is the next stage. And similarly, the collector of the Q2 is also going to the base of the Q4. So here, in this TTL NOR gate, both Q3 and Q4 are connected in the parallel connection. That means here, both the emitter and the collector terminals of this Q3 and Q4 are connected together. And then, these two resistors are connected to the collector and the emitter terminals respectively. And then after, we will have the totem pole output stage. So basically, in this two input TTL NOR gate, we have two separate current-steering stages. And in the second stage, these transistors Q3 and Q4 are connected in the parallel connection. So now, let's understand how this circuit works as the NOR gate. So here, for the two inputs, we will have total four input combinations. So as you know, in case of the NOR gate, when any one of the input is 1,  then the output is equal to 0. And whenever both inputs are 0, at that time only, the output will be equal to 1. So now let's see for the different input combinations, how this circuit will work as the NOR gate. And first, let's take the case when both inputs are 0. So here, let's say the voltage at both input nodes is equal to roughly 0.2V. So we know that with this input,  the base emitter junction of the Q1 will get forward biased. And similarly, this base emitter junction of the Q2 will also get forward biased. And if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to 0.3V. Likewise, the voltage at the collector of the Q2 is also roughly equal to 0.3V. So because of this voltage, both Q3 and Q4 will remain in the OFF condition. And due to that, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to Vcc. Or in this case, that is roughly equal to 5V. So due to that, this Q6 will get turned ON, while the Q5 will remain in the OFF condition. Because here, there won't be any drop across this 1K resistor. And due to that, this Q5 will also remain in the OFF condition. And since the voltage at the base of the Q6 is roughly equal to 5V, so the Q6 will remain in the ON condition. And due to that, the output voltage is roughly equal to 3.6V. That means whenever both inputs are 0, at that time, the output is HIGH. So similarly, now let's see another extreme case, where both inputs are HIGH. So in this case, let's say the input is equal to 3.6V. So we know that when the input is equal to 3.6V, at that time, the first transistor will operate in the reverse active region. That means in this condition, the voltage at this node is roughly equal to 2.1V. And similarly, the voltage over here will also be equal to 2.1V. So because of this voltage, if we see the voltage at the collector of the Q1 and Q2, then that is roughly equal to 1.5V. And because of this voltage, this Q3 and Q4, as well as the Q5 will get turned ON. And at this voltage, they will operate in the saturation. That means here, if we see the output voltage, then that is roughly equal to 0.2V. Because this output voltage is between the  collector and the emitter terminal of the Q5. So since the Q5 is operating in the saturation, so the output voltage is roughly equal to 0.2V. And here, since Q3 and Q4, as well as the Q5 is operating in the saturation, so the voltage at the base of the Q6 will not be sufficient to turn ON this transistor Q6. So therefore, this Q6 will remain in the OFF condition. That means we can say that when both inputs are HIGH, at that time, the output of the NOR gate is equal to LOW. So similarly, let's see the case when one of the inputs is LOW,  while another input is HIGH. So let's say the voltage at the A input is equal to 0.2V,  while the voltage at the B input is roughly equal to 3.6V. So as we have seen, when the input is LOW, at that time, this base emitter junction of the Q1 will get forward biased. That means in this condition, the voltage at the base of the Q1 will be equal to 0.9V. And if we see the voltage at the collector of the Q1, then that is roughly equal to 0.3V. Because here, both base emitter junction as well as the collector base junctions are forward biased. So with this voltage, this Q3 will get turned OFF. Because here, this voltage will not be sufficient to make the base emitter junction of the Q3 to be forward biased. And hence, the Q3 will remain in the OFF condition. On the other hand, if we see this transistor Q2, then its input is HIGH. Therefore, this Q2 will operate in the reverse active region. And in this condition, the voltage at the base will be roughly equal to 2.1V. So in this condition, this base collector junction will also get forward biased. And the voltage over here will be roughly equal to 1.5V. So with this voltage, both Q4 and Q5 will be in the ON condition. And they will operate in the saturation. So since the Q5 is operating in the saturation,  so the output of this transistor will be roughly equal to 0.2V. That is the VCE of this transistor Q5. And since the Q4 and Q5 are operating in the saturation, so the voltage at the base of the Q6 will not be sufficient to make this transistor Q3 in the ON condition. And therefore, the output will remain LOW. So the same thing will also happen when the A is HIGH and the B is LOW. So whenever this A is HIGH, then the Q3 will get turned ON and  the Q4 will remain in the OFF condition. And in that case, through this transistor Q3,  the current will flow through the 1kΩ resistor. And because of that, the Q5 will get turned ON. That means in this third case also, we will get the same result. So we can say that in this TTL NOR gate, when any one of the inputs is HIGH, at that time, the output of the gate will be logic LOW. And that is how this circuit works as the NOR gate. So, so far in our discussion, if you have observed the last stage of the TTL gate,  then that was the Totem-pole stage. And therefore, these logic gates are known as the TTL logic gates with the Totem-pole output. So in the standard TTL gates, apart from this Totem-pole stage,  we also have the other two versions. That is the open collector gate and the tri-state gates. So in the next video, you will also learn about these two types. But I hope in this video, you understood the working of the TTL NAND gate and the NOR gate. So if you have any questions or suggestions, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",ttl logic ttl nand and nor gates explained,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in the previous video, we have seen the internal circuit of the inverter. and based on this circuit, we have also seen the voltage transfer characteristic of this inverter. so, similarly, in this video, let us see the internal circuit of the nand gate as well as the nor gate. and first, let us see the internal circuit of the nand gate. so if you see the circuit of the nand gate, then it is very similar to the inverter circuit. but here, the first transistor is the multi-emitter transistor. so as its name suggests, this multi-emitter transistor has the two emitter terminals. that means suppose, if we have two transistors, and for these two transistors, if the base and collectors are connected together, then the two emitter terminals will behave as the multi-emitter transistor. but in the actual circuits, instead of having the two separate transistors, we have the single transistor, and the base and the collector terminals are common. but it will have the two emitter terminals. so in this ttl nand gate, depending on the required number of inputs, this multi-emitter transistor is used. so here, this circuit is the example of the two input nand gate. so now, lets see the working of the given circuit. so earlier, we have seen that in this ttl logic circuit, the first stage is the current steering stage. so based on the input, the current goes either on the input side, or it goes towards the next stage. so whenever this base-emitter junction is forward biased, then the current will go towards the input side. so we can say that whenever the input is low, then most of the current will flow towards the input side. and whenever the input is high, then this base-emitter junction will get reversed biased, and most of the current will go towards the next stage. so in this multi-emitter transistor, if any one of the inputs is low, then also this base-emitter junction will get forward biased. and in that condition, most of the current will flow through that specific input. so whenever we will take the different input combinations of this a and b at that time, we will discuss about it in more detail. so here, for the two inputs, we will have total four input combinations. and if we see the truth table of the nand gate, then this is how it will look like. that means whenever any one of the inputs to the nand gate is zero, at that time, the output is logic high. and whenever both inputs are high, at that time only, the output of the gate is low. so now, lets see how this circuit works as the nand gate. and for that, lets consider the case when both inputs a and b are zero. so here, lets assume that the voltage at both input terminals is roughly equal to 0.2v. so here, with this voltage, both base-emitter junctions of the q1 will get forward biased. and therefore, the voltage over here will be roughly equal to 0.9v. and with this voltage, the collector base junction of the q1 will also get forward biased. that means here, the voltage around here will be roughly equal to 0.3v. so with this voltage, the base-emitter junction of the q2 will not get forward biased. and therefore, the q2 will remain in the off condition. and since the q2 is in the off condition, so the q4 will also remain in the off condition. and since the q2 and q4 are in the off condition, so they hardly draw any current. that means here, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to vcc. or in this case, that is roughly equal to 5v. and with this voltage, the base-emitter junction of the q3 will get forward biased. and if we see the voltage at the output, then that is equal to 5 minus the drop across the vbe of the q3, minus the drop across the diode. that is equal to 5 minus 1.4v. that is equal to 3.6v. and this output voltage can be considered as the logic high. so we can say that when both inputs are zero, at that time, the output of this nand gate is equal to logic high. so similarly, now lets take another extreme case, when both inputs a and b are high. so in this condition, lets say the voltage at both input terminals is roughly equal to 3.6v. so in the earlier video of the ttl inverter, we have seen that when the input voltage is more than 1.5v, then this q2 and q4 will get forward biased, and they will remain in the on condition. and if we go beyond the 1.5v, then both q2 and q4 will operate in the saturation. that means in this condition, if we see this voltage drop, or the vbe, then that is roughly equal to 0.75v. and due to that, the voltage at this node is roughly equal to 1.5v. so due to this, the voltage at the base of the q1 will not go beyond the 2.1v. so in this condition, the base emitter junction of the q1 will get reverse biased, while the collector base junction will get forward biased. and therefore, this q1 will operate in the reverse active region. so in this condition, since the q4 is operating in the saturation, so the output voltage is roughly equal to 0.2v. and since q2 is also operating in the saturation, so the voltage at this node, or at the base of the q3 will not be sufficient to turn this transistor q3 in the on condition. and therefore, this q3 will remain in the off condition. that means we can say that, when both the inputs are high, at that time, the output of this ttl nand gate is equal to logic low, that is roughly equal to 0.2v. so similarly, lets see the case where one of the inputs is logic 0, while the other input is high. so here, we will take the second case, where this a input is logic low, while the b input is high. so lets say, one of the inputs is at 0.2v, while the other input is at 3.6v. so as i said earlier, in this multi-emitter transistor, when any one of the inputs is low, then the base emitter junction will get forward biased. lets see why. so here, through this resistor r1, the vcc is connected to the base of the q1. and here, since a is low, so due to that, this base emitter junction will get forward biased. so in that condition, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is equal to 0.9v. and with this base voltage, the second base emitter junction will not get forward biased. because here, the voltage at one end is equal to 0.9v, while the voltage at the other end is equal to 3.6v. and due to that, this base emitter junction will not get forward biased. but here, since one of the base emitter junction is already forward biased, so the current will flow through that input. and due to that, if we see the voltage at this end, then that is roughly equal to 0.3v. so because of this voltage, both q2 and q4 will remain in the off condition. and since they are in the off condition, so there is hardly any flow of current through the emitter of the q2. so we can say that the voltage at the base of the q3 is roughly equal to vcc. so due to that, q3 will go in the on condition, and the output voltage is roughly equal to 3.6v, that is 5 - 1.4v. so we can say that in that condition, the output of the ttl nand gate will be logic-high. so we can say that when any one of the inputs to the nand gate is low, at that time, the output is equal to logic-high. and the same can also be seen for another input combination. so that is how this circuit will work as the ttl nand gate. so similarly, now lets see the internal circuit of the two inputs nor gate, and lets understand how this circuit works as the nor gate. so here, if you see the circuit of the ttl nor gate, then here, for the two inputs, we have the separate current-steering stages. so here, this part is the current-steering stage for the a input, while the second part is the current-steering stage for the b input. and here, the collector of the q1 is going into the base of the q3. that is the next stage. and similarly, the collector of the q2 is also going to the base of the q4. so here, in this ttl nor gate, both q3 and q4 are connected in the parallel connection. that means here, both the emitter and the collector terminals of this q3 and q4 are connected together. and then, these two resistors are connected to the collector and the emitter terminals respectively. and then after, we will have the totem pole output stage. so basically, in this two input ttl nor gate, we have two separate current-steering stages. and in the second stage, these transistors q3 and q4 are connected in the parallel connection. so now, lets understand how this circuit works as the nor gate. so here, for the two inputs, we will have total four input combinations. so as you know, in case of the nor gate, when any one of the input is 1, then the output is equal to 0. and whenever both inputs are 0, at that time only, the output will be equal to 1. so now lets see for the different input combinations, how this circuit will work as the nor gate. and first, lets take the case when both inputs are 0. so here, lets say the voltage at both input nodes is equal to roughly 0.2v. so we know that with this input, the base emitter junction of the q1 will get forward biased. and similarly, this base emitter junction of the q2 will also get forward biased. and if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to 0.3v. likewise, the voltage at the collector of the q2 is also roughly equal to 0.3v. so because of this voltage, both q3 and q4 will remain in the off condition. and due to that, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to vcc. or in this case, that is roughly equal to 5v. so due to that, this q6 will get turned on, while the q5 will remain in the off condition. because here, there wont be any drop across this 1k resistor. and due to that, this q5 will also remain in the off condition. and since the voltage at the base of the q6 is roughly equal to 5v, so the q6 will remain in the on condition. and due to that, the output voltage is roughly equal to 3.6v. that means whenever both inputs are 0, at that time, the output is high. so similarly, now lets see another extreme case, where both inputs are high. so in this case, lets say the input is equal to 3.6v. so we know that when the input is equal to 3.6v, at that time, the first transistor will operate in the reverse active region. that means in this condition, the voltage at this node is roughly equal to 2.1v. and similarly, the voltage over here will also be equal to 2.1v. so because of this voltage, if we see the voltage at the collector of the q1 and q2, then that is roughly equal to 1.5v. and because of this voltage, this q3 and q4, as well as the q5 will get turned on. and at this voltage, they will operate in the saturation. that means here, if we see the output voltage, then that is roughly equal to 0.2v. because this output voltage is between the collector and the emitter terminal of the q5. so since the q5 is operating in the saturation, so the output voltage is roughly equal to 0.2v. and here, since q3 and q4, as well as the q5 is operating in the saturation, so the voltage at the base of the q6 will not be sufficient to turn on this transistor q6. so therefore, this q6 will remain in the off condition. that means we can say that when both inputs are high, at that time, the output of the nor gate is equal to low. so similarly, lets see the case when one of the inputs is low, while another input is high. so lets say the voltage at the a input is equal to 0.2v, while the voltage at the b input is roughly equal to 3.6v. so as we have seen, when the input is low, at that time, this base emitter junction of the q1 will get forward

base of the q6 will not be sufficient to make this transistor q3 in the on condition. and therefore, the output will remain low. so the same thing will also happen when the a is high and the b is low. so whenever this a is high, then the q3 will get turned on and the q4 will remain in the off condition. and in that case, through this transistor q3, the current will flow through the 1kω resistor. and because of that, the q5 will get turned on. that means in this third case also, we will get the same result. so we can say that in this ttl nor gate, when any one of the inputs is high, at that

that, this q5 will also remain in the off condition. and since the voltage at the base of the q6 is roughly equal to 5v, so the q6 will remain in the on condition. and due to that, the output voltage is roughly equal to 3.6v. that means whenever both inputs are 0, at that time, the output is high. so similarly, now lets see another extreme case, where both inputs are high. so in this case, lets say the input is equal to 3.6v. so we know that when the input is equal to 3.6v, at that time, the first transistor will operate in the reverse active region. that means in this condition, the voltage

is roughly equal to 1.5v. and because of this voltage, this q3 and q4, as well as the q5 will get turned on. and at this voltage, they will operate in the saturation. that means here, if we see the

transistor q6. so therefore, this q6 will remain in the off condition. that means we can say that when both inputs are high, at that time, the output of the nor gate is equal to low. so similarly, lets see the case when one of the inputs is low, while another input is high. so lets say the voltage at the a input is equal to 0.2v, while the voltage at the b input is roughly equal to 3.6v. so as we have seen, when the input is low, at that time, this base emitter junction of the q1 will get forward biased. that means in this condition, the voltage at the base of the q1 will be equal to 0.9v. and if we see the voltage at the collector of the q1, then that is roughly equal to 0.3v. because here, both base emitter junction as well as the collector base junctions are forward biased. so with

roughly equal to 2.1v. so in this condition, this base collector junction will also get forward biased. and the voltage over here will be roughly equal to 1.5v. so with this voltage, both q4 and q5 will be in the on condition. and they will operate in the saturation. so since the q5 is operating in the saturation, so the output of this transistor will be roughly equal to 0.2v. that is the vce of this transistor q5. and since the q4 and q5 are operating in the saturation, so the voltage at the base of the q6 will not be sufficient to make this transistor q3 in the on condition. and therefore, the output will remain low. so the same thing will also happen when the a is high and the b is low. so whenever this a is high, then the q3 will get turned on and the q4 will remain in the off condition. and in that case, through this transistor q3, the current will flow through the 1kω resistor. and because of that, the q5 will get turned on. that means in this third case also, we will get the same result. so we can say that in this ttl nor gate, when any one of the inputs is high, at that time, the output of the gate will be logic low. and that is how this circuit works as the nor

O5M2osASIQA,Why TTL logic gates have Totem Pole output stage ? #digitalelectronics,2025-01-18 05:17:19+00:00,2025,1,Saturday,"So, in this short video, let's understand, typically, why the TTL gates have the Totem Pole output stage. So, if you see any standard TTL gate, then it consists of the three stages. The first one is the current steering stage. So, depending on the input voltage level, this stage drives the current either towards the input side or towards the next stage. Then after, if you see the next stage, then that is the phase splitter. So, this stage generates the two outputs, which are a complement of each other. And these two outputs drive the final stage, which is known as the Totem-pole. So, let's see the purpose of this stage. So, in this Totem-pole stage, the upper transistor acts as an active pull-up, and it pulls the output voltage towards the positive rail. While if you see the lower transistor, then that acts as an active pull-down, and it pulls down the output voltage towards the ground potential. So here, since the phase splitter circuit provides the two complementary outputs, so at any given time, only one transistor will be ON. So whenever the input is low, then this Q3 will become ON. And in the ON condition, it will act as an emitter follower. And because of that, it provides the low output resistance. And it is helpful in driving the high-capacitive loads without degrading the switching time. So because of this lower output resistance, the switching time will be faster, and hence the propagation delay will be lower. Similarly, when the input is high, then the Q3 will become OFF, and the Q4 will become ON So in this condition, whatever charge that is stored in the base during the ON condition, that will be discharged through this resistor. And this transistor Q4 will offer the lower resistance path  for discharging the capacitive load. So in short, because of this Totem-pole output stage, the switching speed of the TTL gate increases, and hence the propagation delay reduces. So that is the advantage of the Totem-pole stage. But if you see the drawbacks, then because of this Totem-pole stage,  the output voltage cannot go beyond 3.6V when this Q3 is ON. Moreover, the Totem-pole outputs cannot be connected together to perform the wired AND logic. On the other hand, if we have open collector TTL gates,  then their outputs can be connected together. But in this case, because of the passive pull-up resistor, the propagation delay of such gates will be larger compared to the Totem-pole outputs. So in short, in the TTL logic, when we need a faster speed,  then the Totem-pole output stage is used.",why ttl logic gates have totem pole output stage ? digitalelectronics,"so, in this short video,

used.",-0.055180516,-0.0488677,0.014457091,0.019433526,0.030101994,0.016255803,-0.014228353,0.043742422,0.1307881,0.08559622,-0.046773802,-0.027551599,-0.032974288,-0.059295464,0.020095533,0.012047579,-0.08725358,-0.0083495565,0.025046598,-0.040253937,0.10205797,-0.09046321,-0.031337652,0.0011661244,-0.085167065,0.07428182,-0.12607756,-0.022301497,0.06104403,-0.10774822,-0.11395614,0.02159143,-0.072903536,0.01672891,-0.0678168,0.018595131,0.12674074,-0.007981781,-0.010856664,-0.032779515,0.06789738,-0.023569562,0.034405902,-0.01892425,-0.000630125,0.043103196,-0.043643136,0.027753687,-0.0446094,-0.11561473,0.02773934,0.027298998,0.05876463,0.015236168,-0.0848809,0.1281589,0.057329275,0.018523937,-0.06673793,0.042070206,-0.0764788,-0.026716061,-0.06858741,-0.055611964,0.11532339,-0.0685009,0.03201187,-0.015284865,0.009559427,0.007232219,-0.041857243,-0.11215718,0.013415315,-0.011669197,0.0014787307,-0.063958146,0.104724035,0.02344383,0.0048836027,0.024169175,0.05362252,0.015070992,-0.043700308,-0.0594722,-0.0405185,-0.075579785,-0.1115624,0.0075539527,0.021079477,0.022734417,-0.029901912,0.016528418,0.011308638,0.018196004,-0.008044129,-0.036562394,0.040443525,0.06697596,0.10790825,-0.003889985,0.06295614,-0.017132463,0.060063448,-0.08820352,-0.030266814,-0.05266432,0.024495637,-0.014654603,0.06318214,-0.039075874,0.0017939538,0.051668093,0.10644122,0.06809929,-0.089839004,-0.0071583153,-0.099070646,0.028006222,0.1386334,-0.015092007,-0.029951794,-0.04256714,-0.0074537867,0.13747819,0.06762193,-0.11927026,-0.029606443,-4.541746e-34,0.010331868,0.0042240904,0.03701106,-0.03579477,0.021735927,0.057776306,-0.017076313,-0.00844458,-0.04067335,0.058538847,-0.015931398,-0.06041244,-0.0028140112,0.047175135,0.017741904,-0.051616777,-0.03984983,-0.0072714104,-0.047523852,-0.06785803,0.01624269,0.06948271,-0.03183069,0.00093231234,-0.008096207,0.025897715,-0.00822261,0.0059569017,-0.062250134,0.02282531,0.020526243,-0.00020235445,0.011934986,0.06903462,0.06799025,0.028578702,0.072776265,-0.008085631,0.014888463,0.04338017,-0.04697541,-0.054652054,-0.0048075947,0.028010953,-0.0715316,-0.08331531,-0.05448613,0.012632082,-0.016369903,-0.043858275,0.03875507,-0.05722998,0.00016570505,-0.037776705,0.0041598203,0.026980149,-0.021777865,-0.006418628,0.006113541,0.12006137,-0.04138873,0.0064890655,-0.051586393,0.040436003,-0.07030678,0.044620458,0.046621162,-0.07526487,0.050398108,0.025026387,-0.04876144,0.107807875,0.047819525,-0.01956165,0.01747593,0.018354598,-0.0045653135,0.030040665,0.036297437,0.01918663,0.011258,-0.026071003,-0.055655137,0.03384865,0.04355066,0.019411294,0.056197427,-0.0008068919,-0.08599141,-0.026997626,-0.010299759,-0.033572756,0.06938112,0.03408707,0.10490023,-2.3255091e-33,0.015720533,0.016068079,-0.07261843,-0.069228545,-0.028755132,-0.021112742,-0.014570153,-0.040321212,0.000707806,-0.0080368845,0.03280029,0.02243715,-0.018626405,0.04313711,-0.056518834,-0.045747876,0.08390377,0.0052020536,-0.005346815,-0.09956308,0.09080833,0.05818014,-0.064177275,0.05733751,-0.0033801994,-0.026274282,-0.022080341,0.08121295,0.010666975,0.079594836,0.03258679,-0.066319756,0.07581935,0.034122862,-0.03407519,-0.007446453,-0.06983613,-0.009492655,0.015581567,0.054368313,-0.019547284,-0.03816138,0.031239916,-0.05042633,0.025099894,0.059259377,0.010562945,0.062577225,0.01183323,-0.038045656,0.031522907,-0.04499832,0.01733246,-0.021117395,-0.025687918,-0.073279984,-0.04084695,0.014008677,-0.026937991,0.005160417,0.04451093,0.01905112,-0.041026544,-0.021519104,0.034078356,-0.020315567,0.0005919672,-0.050948385,0.038079638,-0.0029705109,-0.059155982,0.07714211,0.063506134,-0.01709218,-0.025394455,0.0105645545,-0.034017816,-0.039717633,-0.005777757,-0.053786933,-0.118006185,-0.030707084,-0.0137362685,-0.04819191,0.0016191379,-0.015812356,0.04100411,0.09807084,0.026814554,-0.01634814,0.008496231,0.038479675,-0.012111533,0.04240005,-0.020094354,-5.408467e-08,0.08932003,-0.01938262,-0.12898542,0.006957997,0.014656349,-0.020576242,0.066884674,-0.05521574,-0.0011842593,-0.07897223,-0.075496346,0.010531233,-0.011005839,-0.03861037,0.13099842,0.06662905,-0.03494704,0.00084756844,0.01590916,0.017384766,0.0041414006,-0.096068256,-0.009990167,-0.031555027,-0.019992579,0.034577787,0.0008663659,0.06934868,0.023480972,0.010299272,0.010673356,-0.025535492,-0.07501966,0.14175396,0.040968776,0.0770026,-0.06326075,0.029608961,0.053475443,-0.0038877064,0.020930285,-0.027147843,-0.028547313,0.08531483,-0.017652437,0.0592408,-0.053392887,0.02529873,0.043632492,-0.012264067,-0.080949284,0.05003874,0.041539516,-0.020511845,-0.044654623,0.0005507673,0.0050439104,-0.022780057,-0.033717588,0.04621322,0.022261867,0.031185191,0.021746365,0.010001502
I74vWLGif_o,TTL Logic Explained | TTL Inverter Circuit | Noise Margin and Fanout of TTL Circuits,2025-01-12 18:00:06+00:00,2025,1,Sunday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the transistor-transistor logic which is also  commonly known as the TTL. So the logic gates which we have seen so far are designed using the different IC technologies, which is also known as the logic families. So the common logic families which are typically used in the IC fabrication are RTL,  DTL, TTL, ECL and CMOS. So these logic families or the IC technology which is used in designing these logic gates determines their characteristics like the speed, voltage levels, fan-out and power consumption. So some of the logic families like the RTL and the DTL are nowadays obsolete. But the other logic families like the TTL, ECL and the CMOS are still in use. So in the earlier videos, we have already seen the CMOS logic. So similarly, in this video, we will learn about the TTL logic. So as its name suggests, this TTL logic is based on the bipolar junction transistor. So every logic family has a defined range of input and output voltages that can be considered as either logic high or the logic LOW. So in case of the TTL logic, any input voltage between 0 to 0.8 V can be considered as  the logic '0', while any input voltage between 2 V to 5 V can be considered as the logic '1'. Similarly for the output, any output voltage between 2.4 V to 5 V will be considered as the logic HIGH, while any output voltage between 0 to 0.4 V will be considered as the logic LOW. So now let's see the circuit of the TTL logic gate. So this is the internal circuit of the TTL inverter. So in this video, what we will do, we will understand the working of this TTL logic gate with the help of this inverter circuit and in the next video, we will see that how to design the other TTL logic gates like the NAND gate, NOR gate and the other logic gates. So if you see the voltage transfer characteristic of this TTL inverter, then this is how it will look like. So this voltage transfer characteristic basically shows as the input changes, then how the output voltage changes. So in digital circuits, these logic gates are used in these two regions. So when the input is low, then the output is high, and it will be more than 3.6 V. And similarly, when the input is more than 2 V, then the output is typically around  0.2 V. And this can be considered as the logic LOW. So to understand how this TTL circuit works, first we should understand the different  stages of the TTL circuit. So in this TTL circuit, the first stage is known as the current steering part. So basically, this part directs the current either towards the input side or towards the base of the transistor Q2, depending on the input voltage. Then if you see the next part, then that is known as the phase splitter. So basically, this part generates the two output voltages, which are complement of each other. That means whenever the one output is increasing, at that time, the other output is reducing. For example, when the input voltage is increased from the LOW to HIGH, at that time, the voltage at the collector of the Q2 starts reducing, and at the same time, the voltage at the  emitter of this Q2 will increase. And these two outputs drive the final stage of the TTL circuit, that is known as the totem pole. Because here, the two transistors Q3 and Q4 are stacked on each other like the totem pole. So here, since they are fed through the phase splitter outputs, so at any given time,  only one of the transistors will be on. So it will get clear to you when we see the working of the TTL circuit. So first, let's see how this circuit will work whenever the input is LOW. So let's say, this input is equal to 0.2V. Because we have just seen that for the TTL logic, when the input is between 0 to 0.8V, then it can be considered as the logic '0'. So for this input, let's see how this circuit will behave. So here, I am assuming that you are already aware about the basics of the BJT. And in case, if you are not aware, then please go through the basics of the BJT. Or for that, you can watch this playlist. Alright, so now, when the input is 0.2V, then this base-emitter junction of the Q1 will become forward biased. Because here, the voltage applied to the base is equal to Vcc or the 5V. While if we see the voltage at the emitter, then that is equal to 0.2V. That means here, the base emitter junction of the Q1 will become forward biased. That means now, if we see the voltage at the base, then that would be equal to 0.2 + 0.7V. Or roughly it is equal to 0.9V. So now, if we see the collector base junction of the Q1, then it will be also forward biased. Because here, this transistor is the NPN transistor. And here, the voltage at this node will be close to 0V. So here, for this transistor Q1, both base-emitter junction and the collector-base junction will get forward biased. And therefore, this Q1 will operate in the saturation. So here, since this Q1 is operating in the saturation region, so the small amount of current is going away from the base of the Q2. Moreover, the base of the Q2 does not have sufficient voltage to turn ON this transistor Q2. And therefore, in this condition, only small amount of current will flow in this direction. And through this 4 kΩ resistor, the majority of the current will flow in this direction. That means in this condition, the Q2 will be OFF. And since the Q2 is OFF, so the drop across this resistor R3 will also be equal to 0. And therefore, the base of the Q4 will not have sufficient voltage to turn it ON. And therefore, this transistor Q4 will also remain in the OFF condition. So in this condition, since the Q2 and Q4 are OFF, so the voltage at this node will be close to Vcc. So here, this is the output node, and through the load, it is connected to the ground terminal. So here, to forward bias this base-emitter junction of the transistor Q3, the voltage at this node should be equal to Vbe of the Q3 plus the drop across the diode. That means it should be roughly equal to 1.4 V. And here, since it is more than that, so the base emitter junction of the Q3 will get forward biased. That means in this condition, the Q3 will be in the ON condition. And through this path, the current will flow in the base of the Q3. And if we see the voltage at the output node, then that is roughly equal to 3.6 V. That means Vbe minus the drop across the base emitter junction minus the drop  across the diode. But here, let's determine whether the collector base junction of the Q3 is forward biased or reverse biased. So if it is reverse biased, then the Q3 will operate in the active region. And if it is forward biased, then the Q3 will operate in the saturation. So for this collector base junction to be forward biased, the voltage at the collector should be at least 0.6 to 0.7 V less than the base voltage. Right? So here if you see, then the base voltage is close to Vcc. So we can say that, that is roughly equal to 5 V. That means here, the voltage at the collector should be around 4.2 to 4.3 V. So if that is the case, then this base-collector junction is forward biased, otherwise  it is reverse biased. So here, the drop across the diode is roughly around 0.7 V. That means here, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is equal to 3.6 plus 0.7 V. That is equal to 4.3 V. That means here, the voltage at the emitter of this transistor Q3 is roughly equal to 4.3 V. Moreover, here if we assume that this Q3 is operating in the saturation, in that condition also, the minimum voltage drop across the Vce will be equal to 0.2 V. So in that case, if we see the voltage at the collector, then that would be equal to this 4.3 V + 0.2 V. That is equal to 4.5 V. So if that is the case, then the difference in voltage between the base and the collector would be less than 0.7 V. And due to that, this base collector junction will not get forward biased. Because here, the voltage difference between the base and the collector is not able to cross the 0.6 to 0.7 V. So, we can say that here this collector base junction is operating in the reverse biased condition. And therefore, we can say that here this transistor Q3 is operating in the active region. So we can say that when the input voltage is low, then the output voltage is around 3.6 V. And as we have seen, it can be considered as the logic high. So in this way, when the input to this TTL inverter is low, then its output will be high. So we can say that in this voltage transfer characteristic, in this region, when the input is low, at that time, this Q1 is in the saturation, while the Q2 and Q4 will remain in the OFF condition. And similarly, if we see the transistor Q3, then it will be ON and it will operate in the active region. So similarly, let's see how this inverter circuit works when the input is HIGH. So let's say, the input to the inverter is equal to 3.6 V. Because this input voltage can be considered as the logic HIGH. Right? So when the input is 3.6 V, then the same will also appear at the emitter of the transistor Q1. Now here, through this resistor R1, this 5 V is connected to the base of the Q1. But here, the voltage at the base will not go beyond 2.1 V. So let's see why. So here, initially, let's assume that this base emitter junction gets forward biased. And due to that, the voltage at this node is equal to 3.6 V plus 0.7 V. That is roughly equal to 4.3 V. And due to that, this collector base junction will also get forward biased. So in that case, the voltage at this node will be equal to 4.3 minus 0.6 V. That is roughly equal to 3.7 V. So here, if the voltage at the base of the Q2 is equal to 3.7 V, then the base emitter junction of the Q2 will also get forward biased. And if we see the voltage over here, or at the emitter of the transistor Q2, then that is roughly equal to 3 V. So this voltage will also appear directly between the base emitter of the Q4. That means here, the base emitter junction of the Q4 will also get forward biased. And if that is the case, then the voltage between these two nodes will not be more  than the 0.7 or the 0.75 V. Right? So due to that, what will happen, this Q4 will be in the ON condition, and it will operate in the saturation. And if we see the voltage at the VBE of the Q4, then that will be around 0.75 V. Similarly, this Q2 will also operate in the saturation. And therefore, the VBE of the Q2 will also be around 0.75 V. That means if we see the voltage at the base of the Q2, then that is roughly equal to 1.5 V. And since the collector base junction of the Q1 is forward biased, so the voltage at the base of the Q1 will be roughly equal to this 1.5 V plus 0.6 V. That is roughly equal to 2.1 V. That means here, if this Q2 and Q4 is in the ON condition, and they are operating in the saturation, then the voltage at the base of the Q1 will not go beyond the 2.1 V. Because as you know, when the transistor is in the ON condition, then its base emitter voltage cannot go beyond the 0.7 or the 0.75 V. That means here, the base of the Q1 will not go beyond the 2.1 V. And therefore, when this input is HIGH, then this base emitter junction of the Q1 will get reverse biased. So typically, when the transistor is operating in the active region, at that time, this base emitter junction is forward biased and the collector base junction is reverse biased. But here, it is exactly opposite to that. That means here, the Q1 will operate in the reverse active region. And due to that, through this R1, the current will flow into the base of the Q2 instead of going in the other direction. So now, the Q2 and Q4 will operate in the saturation, and because of that, the large amount of current will flow into the collector of the Q2. So due to this flow of current, the voltage drop across the R2 will be more. And due to that, now the voltage at the base of the Q3 will be less, and it will not be enough to turn on this Q3. So let's approximately find out what is the voltage at the base of the Q3. So here, the emitter current of the Q2 will get divided in two parts. So some current will flow through this resistor, while the remaining current will flow  into the base of the Q4. And here, the drop across this 1K resistor would be around 0.75 V. And here, since the Q4 is operating in the saturation, so this voltage Vce or the output will be roughly around 0.2 V. Similarly, since the Q2 is also operating in the saturation, so this voltage Vce will also be roughly around 0.25 V. And therefore, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to 1 V. So this voltage will not be sufficient to turn ON this transistor Q3. Because here, if the output is 0.2 V, then to turn ON this transistor Q3, we will require this 0.2 V plus the drop across this diode that is 0.7 V, plus the drop across the Vbe, that is one more 0.7 V. So we can say that to turn ON this transistor Q3, we will roughly require this 0.2 V plus 1.4 V. That is roughly equal to 1.6 V. That means here, the Q3 will remain in the OFF condition. And in this way, when the input to the TTL inverter is HIGH, then the output will be LOW and it will be close to 0.2 V. So here, in this transfer characteristic if we see, then during this region of operation, the Q1 will operate in the reverse active region, while the Q2 and Q4 will operate in the saturation. Here if we see the transistor Q3, then it will remain in the OFF condition. So that is how this circuit works as the TTL inverter. That means when the input is LOW, then the output is HIGH. And when the input is HIGH, then the output is LOW. But now, let us also see, when the input is between this range, then how the output changes. So as you can see, up to certain input voltage, this output almost remains  constant up to 3.6 V. So basically, it will remain constant until this Q2 gets turned ON. So for that, first of all, let's see when this Q2 will get turned ON. So here, this Q2 will be in the ON condition when the voltage at the base of the Q2 is more than 0.7 V. So it will happen when the input is more than 0.6 V. So let's say, the input is equal to 0.7 V. So when it is 0.7 V, then the base of the Q1 will be at 1.4 V. Right? And if we see the voltage at the collector, then that is roughly equal to 0.8 V. Because here, when the input is around 0.7 V, at that time, this base emitter junction gets forward biased. And due to that, the voltage at the base will be roughly around 1.4 V. And similarly, since the collector base junction is also get forward biased, so the voltage at the collector or the voltage at the base of the Q2 will be roughly around 0.8 V. That means once again, here this Q1 is operating in the saturation. Because here, both base emitter junction and the collector base junctions are forward biased. And since it is operating in the saturation, so the drop between the collector and the emitter would be roughly around 0.1 to 0.2 V. So we can say that when the voltage at the input is more than 0.6 V, then the voltage at the base of the Q2 will be slightly more than 0.7 V. And due to that, this base emitter junction of the Q2 will get forward biased. So as it gets forward biased, then the current will start flowing through the base of the Q2. So earlier if you see, then when the input was less than 0.6 V, at that time, the majority of the current was flowing into the input side via this R1. But now, some of the current will get diverted towards the base of the Q2. And since the current starts flowing through the base of the Q2, so due to that, we will also get some emitter current. And because of that, the voltage will start getting build up across this resistor R3. But until the voltage drop across the R3 is not more than 0.7 V, this Q4 will remain in the OFF condition. So here, since there is some flow of current through the collector of the Q2, so due to that, there will be a more voltage drop across the R2. And because of that, the voltage at the base of the Q3 will reduce. And effectively, the output voltage will also reduce. Because we know that this Vout is equal to this Vb minus 1.4 V. So as the Vb reduces, then the output voltage will also reduce. So we can say that when the input voltage is more than 0.6 V, at that time, this Q2 and Q3 will be in the ON condition, while the Q4 will be in the OFF condition. That means in this region of operation, the Q1 is operating in the saturation, while the Q2 and Q3 will operate in the active region. And if we see the Q4, then it will remain in the OFF condition. So until this Q4 is OFF, this output voltage will reduce at the fixed rate with the increase in the input voltage. But once the Q4 gets turned ON, this output voltage will reduce even at the faster rate. So first, let's see when this Q4 will get turned ON. And once it is turned ON, then how the output voltage will fall sharply. So here, this Q4 will get turned ON when the voltage across the R3 is more than 0.6 V. So as soon as this voltage reaches the 0.65 V, then the base-emitter junction of the  Q4 will get forward biased. And for that to happen, let's find out the required input voltage. So let's say the voltage across the base emitter junction of the Q4 is equal to 0.65 V. And let's say across this transistor Q2, the voltage is also equal to 0.65 V. That means if we see the voltage at the base of the Q2, then that is equal to roughly 1.3 V. And here if we subtract the drop across the transistor Q1, then the input voltage should be more than 1.2 V. Because here, the Q1 is operating in the saturation right now. So we can say that when the input is more than 1.2 V, at that time this Q4 will get turned ON. And now it will also start drawing the current through the emitter of the Q2. That means effectively, now the emitter current of the Q2 will increase. So further, if we increase this input voltage, then effectively the voltage which is  appearing at the base of the Q2 will increase. And due to that, the base current as well as the collector current of the Q2 will increase. And due to that, now the drop across the resistor R2 will further increase. And due to that drop, now the voltage which is appearing at the base of the  Q3 will further reduce. Or effectively, we can say that now the output voltage will fall more sharply. So due to that, here we are seeing the sharp fall. And after a certain increase in the voltage drop across the resistor R2, the voltage at the base of the Q3 will not be sufficient to keep the transistor Q3 in the ON condition. And due to that, now the Q3 will also go in the OFF state. So we can say that during this region of operation, the Q1 will still operate in the saturation, while the Q2 will operate in the active region. Moreover, the Q4 will also get turned ON. And as soon as it gets turned ON, then the Q3 will go from the ON to OFF state. So now, during this region of operation, with the further little increase in the input voltage, the voltage at the base of the Q2 will increase. And due to that, the emitter current of the Q2 will further increase. And since the part of the emitter current is directly going into the base of the Q4, so first, this Q4 will go into the saturation. And as it goes into the saturation, then the output voltage will further reduce, and it will be close to 0.2 V. So, we can say that when the input is more than 1.45 V, then assuming this base emitter junction is forward biased, the voltage at the base of the Q1 will be roughly equal to 2.15 V. And here, since the collector-base junction is also forward biased, so the voltage over here will be roughly equal to 1.5 V. So, around at this voltage, this collector- base junction of the Q2 will also get forward biased, and now this Q2 will also operate in the saturation. So now, around at this voltage, both Q2 and Q4 are operating in the saturation. And in this condition, the Q3 will go in the OFF state. And here, now the output voltage is close to 0.2 V. So now, if we further increase the input voltage, then as we have seen, the voltage at the base of the Q1 will not go beyond the 2.15 V. So, we can say that the voltage at the base of the Q1 is restricted to around 2.1 to 2.15 V. So when the input voltage goes above this 1.5 V, at that time, this base emitter junction of the Q1 will get reverse biased. That means whenever the input is more than this, then this base emitter junction of  the Q1 will get reversed biased. And at the same time, this collector base junction will get forward biased. So in this condition, this Q1 will operate in the reverse active region. So that is the case when we consider the input as the HIGH. So we have seen that in this region of operation, the Q1 is operating in the reverse active region, while the Q2 and Q4 are operating in the saturation region. And at the same time, this Q3 remains in the OFF condition. So that is the voltage transfer characteristic of the TTL inverter. And keeping these voltages in mind, the upper and lower limits of the TTL inputs and outputs are defined. So for this TTL logic, this VIL is equal to 0.8 V. That is the maximum input voltage that can be considered as the logic '0'. Similarly, if we see the VOL, then that is equal to 0.4 V. That is the maximum output voltage that can be considered as the logic '0'. So as per this voltage transfer characteristic, when the input is between 0 to 0.8 V, at that time, the output is always more than 3 V. That means whenever the input is between 0 to 0.8 V, at that time, you will surely get the desired result. But here, conservatively, this range is kept from 2.4 V to 5 V. Because during the fabrication, the values of the resistor, as well as the characteristic of this transistor, might differ slightly from batch to batch. So keeping that tolerance in mind, these input and output voltage ranges are defined. So for the TTL logic, if we see the low state noise margin, then that is equal to 0.4 V. Because here, the VIL is equal to 0.8 V, while the VOL is equal to 0.4 V. That means the low state noise margin is equal to 0.4 V. Well, what is noise margin, I have already covered earlier in the separate video. So here, I am not going into the detail. But for more info, you can check that video. Similarly, if we see the high state, then here, this VIH is equal to 2 V. So this VIH is the minimum input voltage that can be considered as the logic HIGH. And similarly, this VOH is equal to 2.4 V. That is the minimum output voltage that can be considered as the logic HIGH. So as per this voltage transfer characteristic, when the input is equal to 2 V, at that time, the output is around 0.2 V. Or we can say that, that is equal to logic '0'. That means whenever the input is equal to VIH, at that time also, the circuit will work properly. And here if you observe, then even at 1.5 V also, we are getting the logic '0'. But considering all tolerances, this TTL range is kept more conservatively. So now, if we see the high state noise margin, then that is equal to VOH minus VIH. So here, this VOH is equal to 2.4 V. And similarly, if we see the VIH then that is equal to 2 V. That means for this TTL logic, this HIGH state noise margin is also equal to 0.4 V. So we can say that for this TTL logic, both the high state and low state noise margin is equal to 0.4 V. So similarly, now let's see the fanout for this TTL logic circuit. So as we have seen, the fanout defines the maximum number of other logic gates that can be connected at the output of the logic gate. So for the TTL logic family, these are the maximum allowed values of the input and the output currents. So when the output of the logic gate is LOW, then the logic gate sinks the current. And when the output is HIGH, then it will source the current. So here, when the output is LOW, then the logic gate will sink the current from the other logic gates. And at that time, the other logic gates will source that current. So this IIL is the maximum current that can flow out of the logic gate when its input is LOW. For example, if we consider this inverter, then for this inverter, when the input is LOW, let's say a 0.2 V, at that time, the voltage at the base will be roughly around 0.9 V. And the current that is flowing in this direction will be roughly equal to this 4 V divided by 4 kΩ, that is equal to 1 mA. So the maximum value that can flow in this direction is defined as 1.6 mA. Similarly, this IOL is equal to 16 mA. So this IOL is the maximum current that the logic gate can sink when its output is LOW. So as I said, when the output of the logic gate is LOW, then it will sink the current from the other logic gates. So here, the maximum allowed value of this current is equal to 16 mA. That means here, this output can sink maximum up to 16 mA of current. And we have seen that each logic gate can supply maximum up to 1.6 mA of current. So from this, we can say that the low-state fan-out for these TTL circuits is equal to IOL divided by IIL. So here, the IOL is equal to 16 mA, while the IIL is equal to 1.6 mA. And therefore, the low-state fan-out is equal to 10. That means whenever the input of the logic gate is low, at that time, maximum we can connect up to 10 loads. So similarly, let's see the HIGH state fan-out. So for that, we need to see the IOH and the IIH. So this IOH is the maximum current that the logic gate can source when its output is HIGH. So for example, when this output is HIGH, then it will supply the current. And this current will flow through the other logic gates. That means the other logic gates which are connected at the output of this logic gate will sink that current. So for the input side, the maximum current limit is defined as the IIH. That is equal to 40 μA. That is the maximum current that the TTL logic gate can sink when the input is HIGH. So here, this IIH is equal to 40 μA. And here, the value of the IOH is equal to 400 μA. So this IOH is the maximum current that can be supplied by the logic gate  when its output is high. So we can say that this HIGH state fan-out is equal to IOH divided by IIH. So here, the IOH is equal to 400 μA, while the IIH is equal to 40 μA. That means the HIGH state fan-out is also equal to 10. So we can say that for the TTL logic, when the output is HIGH, then at the most, we can connect the 10 output loads. And of course, this is valid when the connected logic gates are also of the TTL logic family. But suppose, if we are connecting the other type of logic family at the output, then once again, we need to check all these values for the other logic family. And according to those values, we can decide how many logic gates that we can  connect at the output side. But for the TTL logic gates, the value of this HIGH state and LOW state fan-out  is equal to 10. So if we connect more than these logic gates at the output,  then the performance of the logic gate is not guaranteed. So that is the noise margin and the fan-out of the TTL gates. So I hope in this video, you understood how this TTL circuit works and what is the voltage transfer characteristic of the TTL inverter. And moreover, I hope you also understood, how the noise margin and the fan-out can be calculated for the TTL circuits. So once we understood the working of the basic TTL inverter, so similarly in the next video, we will see the circuits of the other TTL logic gates, like the NOR gate, NAND gate and the other logic gates. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here  in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",ttl logic explained ttl inverter circuit noise margin and fanout of ttl circuits,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the transistor-transistor logic which is also commonly known as the ttl. so the logic gates which we have seen so far are designed using the different ic technologies, which is also known as the logic families. so the common logic families which are typically used in the ic fabrication are rtl, dtl, ttl, ecl and cmos. so these logic families or the ic technology which is used in designing these logic gates determines their characteristics like the speed, voltage levels, fan-out and power consumption. so some of the logic families like the rtl and the dtl are nowadays obsolete. but the other logic families like the ttl, ecl and the cmos are still in use. so in the earlier videos, we have already seen the cmos logic. so similarly, in this video, we will learn about the ttl logic. so as its name suggests, this ttl logic is based on the bipolar junction transistor. so every logic family has a defined range of input and output voltages that can be considered as either logic high or the logic low. so in case of the ttl logic, any input voltage between 0 to 0.8 v can be considered as the logic 0, while any input voltage between 2 v to 5 v can be considered as the logic 1. similarly for the output, any output voltage between 2.4 v to 5 v will be considered as the logic high, while any output voltage between 0 to 0.4 v will be considered as the logic low. so now lets see the circuit of the ttl logic gate. so this is the internal circuit of the ttl inverter. so in this video, what we will do, we will understand the working of this ttl logic gate with the help of this inverter circuit and in the next video, we will see that how to design the other ttl logic gates like the nand gate, nor gate and the other logic gates. so if you see the voltage transfer characteristic of this ttl inverter, then this is how it will look like. so this voltage transfer characteristic basically shows as the input changes, then how the output voltage changes. so in digital circuits, these logic gates are used in these two regions. so when the input is low, then the output is high, and it will be more than 3.6 v. and similarly, when the input is more than 2 v, then the output is typically around 0.2 v. and this can be considered as the logic low. so to understand how this ttl circuit works, first we should understand the different stages of the ttl circuit. so in this ttl circuit, the first stage is known as the current steering part. so basically, this part directs the current either towards the input side or towards the base of the transistor q2, depending on the input voltage. then if you see the next part, then that is known as the phase splitter. so basically, this part generates the two output voltages, which are complement of each other. that means whenever the one output is increasing, at that time, the other output is reducing. for example, when the input voltage is increased from the low to high, at that time, the voltage at the collector of the q2 starts reducing, and at the same time, the voltage at the emitter of this q2 will increase. and these two outputs drive the final stage of the ttl circuit, that is known as the totem pole. because here, the two transistors q3 and q4 are stacked on each other like the totem pole. so here, since they are fed through the phase splitter outputs, so at any given time, only one of the transistors will be on. so it will get clear to you when we see the working of the ttl circuit. so first, lets see how this circuit will work whenever the input is low. so lets say, this input is equal to 0.2v. because we have just seen that for the ttl logic, when the input is between 0 to 0.8v, then it can be considered as the logic 0. so for this input, lets see how this circuit will behave. so here, i am assuming that you are already aware about the basics of the bjt. and in case, if you are not aware, then please go through the basics of the bjt. or for that, you can watch this playlist. alright, so now, when the input is 0.2v, then this base-emitter junction of the q1 will become forward biased. because here, the voltage applied to the base is equal to vcc or the 5v. while if we see the voltage at the emitter, then that is equal to 0.2v. that means here, the base emitter junction of the q1 will become forward biased. that means now, if we see the voltage at the base, then that would be equal to 0.2 0.7v. or roughly it is equal to 0.9v. so now, if we see the collector base junction of the q1, then it will be also forward biased. because here, this transistor is the npn transistor. and here, the voltage at this node will be close to 0v. so here, for this transistor q1, both base-emitter junction and the collector-base junction will get forward biased. and therefore, this q1 will operate in the saturation. so here, since this q1 is operating in the saturation region, so the small amount of current is going away from the base of the q2. moreover, the base of the q2 does not have sufficient voltage to turn on this transistor q2. and therefore, in this condition, only small amount of current will flow in this direction. and through this 4 kω resistor, the majority of the current will flow in this direction. that means in this condition, the q2 will be off. and since the q2 is off, so the drop across this resistor r3 will also be equal to 0. and therefore, the base of the q4 will not have sufficient voltage to turn it on. and therefore, this transistor q4 will also remain in the off condition. so in this condition, since the q2 and q4 are off, so the voltage at this node will be close to vcc. so here, this is the output node, and through the load, it is connected to the ground terminal. so here, to forward bias this base-emitter junction of the transistor q3, the voltage at this node should be equal to vbe of the q3 plus the drop across the diode. that means it should be roughly equal to 1.4 v. and here, since it is more than that, so the base emitter junction of the q3 will get forward biased. that means in this condition, the q3 will be in the on condition. and through this path, the current will flow in the base of the q3. and if we see the voltage at the output node, then that is roughly equal to 3.6 v. that means vbe minus the drop across the base emitter junction minus the drop across the diode. but here, lets determine whether the collector base junction of the q3 is forward biased or reverse biased. so if it is reverse biased, then the q3 will operate in the active region. and if it is forward biased, then the q3 will operate in the saturation. so for this collector base junction to be forward biased, the voltage at the collector should be at least 0.6 to 0.7 v less than the base voltage. right? so here if you see, then the base voltage is close to vcc. so we can say that, that is roughly equal to 5 v. that means here, the voltage at the collector should be around 4.2 to 4.3 v. so if that is the case, then this base-collector junction is forward biased, otherwise it is reverse biased. so here, the drop across the diode is roughly around 0.7 v. that means here, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is equal to 3.6 plus 0.7 v. that is equal to 4.3 v. that means here, the voltage at the emitter of this transistor q3 is roughly equal to 4.3 v. moreover, here if we assume that this q3 is operating in the saturation, in that condition also, the minimum voltage drop across the vce will be equal to 0.2 v. so in that case, if we see the voltage at the collector, then that would be equal to this 4.3 v 0.2 v. that is equal to 4.5 v. so if that is the case, then the difference in voltage between the base and the collector would be less than 0.7 v. and due to that, this base collector junction will not get forward biased. because here, the voltage difference between the base and the collector is not able to cross the 0.6 to 0.7 v. so, we can say that here this collector base junction is operating in the reverse biased condition. and therefore, we can say that here this transistor q3 is operating in the active region. so we can say that when the input voltage is low, then the output voltage is around 3.6 v. and as we have seen, it can be considered as the logic high. so in this way, when the input to this ttl inverter is low, then its output will be high. so we can say that in this voltage transfer characteristic, in this region, when the input is low, at that time, this q1 is in the saturation, while the q2 and q4 will remain in the off condition. and similarly, if we see the transistor q3, then it will be on and it will operate in the active region. so similarly, lets see how this inverter circuit works when the input is high. so lets say, the input to the inverter is equal to 3.6 v. because this input voltage can be considered as the logic high. right? so when the input is 3.6 v, then the same will also appear at the emitter of the transistor q1. now here, through this resistor r1, this 5 v is connected to the base of the q1. but here, the voltage at the base will not go beyond 2.1 v. so lets see why. so here, initially, lets assume that this base emitter junction gets forward biased. and due to that, the voltage at this node is equal to 3.6 v plus 0.7 v. that is roughly equal to 4.3 v. and due to that, this collector base junction will also get forward biased. so in that case, the voltage at this node will be equal to 4.3 minus 0.6 v. that is roughly equal to 3.7 v. so here, if the voltage at the base of the q2 is equal to 3.7 v, then the base emitter junction of the q2 will also get forward biased. and if we see the voltage over here, or at the emitter of the transistor q2, then that is roughly equal to 3 v. so this voltage will also appear directly between the base emitter of the q4. that means here, the base emitter junction of the q4 will also get forward biased. and if that is the case, then the voltage between these two nodes will not be more than the 0.7 or the 0.75 v. right? so due to that, what will happen, this q4 will be in the on condition, and it will operate in the saturation. and if we see the voltage at the vbe of the q4, then that will be around 0.75 v. similarly, this q2 will also operate in the saturation. and therefore, the vbe of the q2 will also be around 0.75 v. that means if we see the voltage at the base of the q2, then that is roughly equal to 1.5 v. and since the collector base junction of the q1 is forward biased, so the voltage at the base of the q1 will be roughly equal to this 1.5 v plus 0.6 v. that is roughly equal to 2.1 v. that means here, if this q2 and q4 is in the on condition, and they are operating in the saturation, then the voltage at the base of the q1 will not go beyond the 2.1 v. because as you know, when the transistor is in the on condition, then its base emitter voltage cannot go beyond the 0.7 or the 0.75 v. that means here, the base of the q1 will not go beyond the 2.1 v. and therefore, when this input is high, then this base emitter junction of the q1 will get reverse biased. so typically, when the transistor is operating in the active region, at that time, this base emitter junction is forward biased and the collector base junction is reverse biased. but here, it is exactly opposite to that. that means here, the q1 will operate in the reverse active region. and due to that, through this r1, the current will flow into the base of the q2 instead of going in the other direction. so now, the q2 and q4 will operate in the saturation, and because of that, the large amount of current will flow into the collector of the q2. so due to this flow of current, the voltage drop across the r2 will be more. and due to that, now the voltage at the base of the q3 will be less, and it will not be enough to turn on this q3. so lets approximately find out what is the voltage at the base of the q3. so here, the emitter current of the q2 will get divided in two parts. so some current will flow through this resistor, while the remaining current will flow into the base of the q4. and here, the drop across this 1k resistor would be around 0.75 v. and here, since the q4 is operating in the saturation, so this voltage vce or the output will be roughly around 0.2 v. similarly, since the q2 is also operating in the saturation, so this voltage vce will also be roughly around 0.25 v. and therefore, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to 1 v. so this voltage will not be sufficient to turn on this transistor q3. because here, if the output is 0.2 v, then to turn on this transistor q3, we will require this 0.2 v plus the drop across this diode that is 0.7 v, plus the drop across the vbe, that is one more 0.7 v. so we can say that to turn on this transistor q3, we will roughly require this 0.2 v plus 1.4 v. that is roughly equal to 1.6 v. that means here, the q3 will remain in the off condition. and in this way, when the input to the ttl inverter is high, then the output will be low and it will be close to 0.2 v. so here, in this transfer characteristic if we see, then during this region of operation, the q1 will operate in the reverse active region, while the q2 and q4 will operate in the saturation. here if we see the transistor q3, then it will remain in the off condition. so that is how this circuit works as the ttl inverter. that means when the input is low, then the output is high. and when the input is high, then the output is low. but now, let us also see, when the input is between this range, then how the output changes. so as you can see, up to certain input voltage, this output almost remains constant up to 3.6 v. so basically, it will remain constant until this q2 gets turned on. so for that, first of all, lets see when this q2 will get turned on. so here, this q2 will be in the on condition when the voltage at the base of the q2 is more than 0.7 v. so it will happen when the input is more than 0.6 v. so lets say, the input is equal to 0.7 v. so when it is 0.7 v, then the base of the q1 will be at 1.4 v. right? and if we see the voltage at the collector, then that is roughly equal to 0.8 v. because here, when the input is around 0.7 v, at that time, this base emitter junction gets forward biased. and due to that, the voltage at the base will be roughly around 1.4 v. and similarly, since the collector base junction is also get forward biased, so the voltage at the collector or the voltage at the base of the q2 will be roughly around 0.8 v. that means once again, here this q1 is operating in the saturation. because here, both base emitter junction and the collector base junctions are forward biased. and since it is operating in the saturation, so the drop between the collector and the emitter would be roughly around 0.1 to 0.2 v. so we can say that when the voltage at the input is more than 0.6 v, then the voltage at the base of the q2 will be slightly more than 0.7 v. and due to that, this base emitter junction of the q2 will get forward biased. so as it gets forward biased, then the current will start flowing through the base of the q2. so earlier if you see, then when the input was less than 0.6 v, at that time, the majority of the current was flowing into the input side via this r1. but now, some of the current will get diverted towards the base of the q2. and since the current starts flowing through the base of the q2, so due to that, we will also get some emitter current. and because of that, the voltage will start getting build up across this resistor r3. but until the voltage drop across the r3 is not more than 0.7 v, this q4 will remain in the off condition. so here, since there is some flow of current through the collector of the q2, so due to that, there will be a more voltage drop across the r2. and because of that, the voltage at the base of the q3 will reduce. and effectively, the output voltage will also reduce. because we know that this vout is equal to this vb minus 1.4 v. so as the vb reduces, then the output voltage will also reduce. so we can say that when the input voltage is more than 0.6 v, at that time, this q2 and q3 will be in the on condition, while the q4 will be in the off condition. that means in this region of operation, the q1 is operating in the saturation, while the q2 and q3 will operate in the active region. and if we see the q4, then it will remain in the off condition. so until this q4 is off, this output voltage will reduce at the fixed rate with the increase in the input voltage. but once the q4 gets turned on, this output voltage will reduce even at the faster rate. so first, lets see when this q4 will get turned on. and once it is turned on, then how the output voltage will fall sharply. so here, this q4 will get turned on when the voltage across the r3 is more than 0.6 v. so as soon as this voltage reaches the 0.65 v, then the base-emitter junction of the q4 will get forward biased. and for that to happen, lets find out the required input voltage. so lets say the voltage across the base emitter junction of the q4 is equal to 0.65 v. and lets say across this transistor q2, the voltage is also equal to 0.65 v. that means if we see the voltage at the base of the q2, then that is equal to roughly 1.3 v. and here if we subtract the drop across the transistor q1, then the input voltage should be more than 1.2 v. because here, the q1 is operating in the saturation right now. so we can say that when the input is more than 1.2 v, at that time this q4 will get turned on. and now it will also start drawing the current through the emitter of the q2. that means effectively, now the emitter current of the q2 will increase. so further, if we increase this input voltage, then effectively the voltage which is appearing at the base of the q2 will increase. and due to that, the base current as well as the collector current of the q2 will increase. and due to that, now the drop across the resistor r2 will further increase. and due to that drop, now the voltage which is appearing at the base of the q3 will further reduce. or effectively, we can say that now the output voltage will fall more sharply. so due to that, here we are seeing the sharp fall. and after a certain increase in the voltage drop across the resistor r2, the voltage at the base of the q3 will not be sufficient to keep the transistor q3 in the on condition. and due to that, now the q3 will also go in the off state. so we can say that during this region of operation, the q1 will still operate in the saturation, while the q2 will operate in the active region. moreover, the q4 will also get turned on. and as soon as it gets turned on, then the q3 will go from the on to off state. so now, during this region of operation, with the further little increase in the input voltage, the voltage at the base of the q2 will increase. and due to that, the emitter current of the q2 will further increase. and since the part of the emitter current is directly going into the base of the q4, so first, this q4 will go into the saturation. and as it goes into the saturation, then the output voltage will further reduce, and it will be close to 0.2 v. so, we can say that when the input is more than 1.45 v, then assuming this base emitter junction is forward biased, the voltage at the base of the q1 will be roughly equal to 2.15 v. and here, since the collector-base junction is also forward biased, so the voltage over here will be roughly equal to 1.5 v. so, around at this voltage, this collector- base junction of the q2 will also get forward biased, and now this q2 will also operate in the saturation. so now, around at this voltage, both q2 and q4 are operating in the saturation. and in this condition, the q3 will go in the off state. and here, now the output voltage is close to 0.2 v. so now, if we further increase the input voltage, then as we have seen, the voltage at the base of the q1 will not go beyond the 2.15 v. so, we can say that the voltage at the base of the q1 is restricted to around 2.1 to 2.15 v. so when the input voltage goes above this 1.5 v, at that time, this base emitter junction of the q1 will get reverse biased. that means whenever the input is more than this, then this base emitter junction of the q1 will get reversed biased. and at the same time, this collector base junction will get forward biased. so in this condition, this q1 will operate in the reverse active region. so that is the case when we consider the input as the high. so we have seen that in this region of operation, the q1 is operating in the reverse active region, while the q2 and q4 are operating in the saturation region. and at the same time, this q3 remains in the off condition. so that is the voltage transfer characteristic of the ttl inverter. and keeping these voltages in mind, the upper and lower limits of the ttl inputs and outputs are defined. so for this ttl logic, this vil is equal to 0.8 v. that is the maximum input voltage that can be considered as the logic 0. similarly, if we see the vol, then that is equal to 0.4 v. that is the maximum output voltage that can be considered as the logic 0. so as per this voltage transfer characteristic, when the input is between 0 to 0.8 v, at that time, the output is always more than 3 v. that means whenever the input is between 0 to 0.8 v, at that time, you will surely get the desired result. but here, conservatively, this range is kept from 2.4 v to 5 v. because during the fabrication, the values of the resistor, as well as the characteristic of this transistor, might differ slightly from batch to batch. so keeping that tolerance in mind, these input and output voltage ranges are defined. so for the ttl logic, if we see the low state noise margin, then that is equal to 0.4 v. because here, the vil is equal to 0.8 v, while the vol is equal to 0.4 v. that means the low state noise margin is equal to 0.4 v. well, what is noise margin, i have already covered earlier in the separate video. so here, i am not going into the detail. but for more info, you can check that video. similarly, if we see the high state, then here, this vih is equal to 2 v. so this vih is the minimum input voltage that can be considered as the logic high. and similarly, this voh is equal to 2.4 v. that is the minimum output voltage that can be considered as the logic high. so as per this voltage transfer characteristic, when the input is equal to 2 v, at that time, the output is around 0.2 v. or we can say that, that is equal to logic 0. that means whenever the input is equal to vih, at that time also, the circuit will work properly. and here if you observe, then even at 1.5 v also, we are getting the logic 0. but considering all tolerances, this ttl range is kept more conservatively. so now, if we see the high state noise margin, then that is equal to voh minus vih. so here, this voh is equal to 2.4 v. and similarly, if we see the vih then that is equal to 2 v. that means for this ttl logic, this high state noise margin is also equal to 0.4 v. so we can say that for this ttl logic, both the high state and low state noise margin is equal to 0.4 v. so similarly, now lets see the fanout for this ttl logic circuit. so as we have seen, the fanout defines the maximum number of other logic gates that can be connected at the output of the logic gate. so for the ttl logic family, these are the maximum allowed values of the input and the output currents. so when the output of the logic gate is low, then the logic gate sinks the current. and when the output is high, then it will source the current. so here, when the output is low, then the logic gate will sink the current from the other logic gates. and at that time, the other logic gates will source that current. so this iil is the maximum current that can flow out of the logic gate when its input is low. for example, if we consider this inverter, then for this inverter, when the input is low, lets say a 0.2 v, at that time, the voltage at the base will be roughly around 0.9 v. and the current that is flowing in this direction will be roughly equal to this 4 v divided by 4 kω, that is equal to 1 ma. so the maximum value that can flow in this direction is defined as 1.6 ma. similarly, this iol is equal to 16 ma. so this iol is the maximum current that the logic gate can sink when its output is low. so as i said, when the output of the logic gate is low, then it will sink the current from the other logic gates. so here, the maximum allowed value of this current is equal to 16 ma. that means here, this output can sink maximum up to 16 ma of current. and we have seen that each logic gate can supply maximum up to 1.6 ma of current. so from this, we can say that the low-state fan-out for these ttl circuits is equal to iol divided by iil. so here, the iol is equal to 16 ma, while the iil is equal to 1.6 ma. and therefore, the low-state fan-out is equal to 10. that means whenever the input of the logic gate is low, at that time, maximum we can connect up to 10 loads. so similarly, lets see the high state fan-out. so for that, we need to see the ioh and the iih. so this ioh is the maximum current that the logic gate can source when its output is high. so for example, when this output is high, then it will supply the current. and this current will flow through the other logic gates. that means the other logic gates which are connected at the output of this logic gate will sink that current. so for the input side, the maximum current limit is defined as the iih. that is equal to 40 μa. that is the maximum current that the ttl logic gate can sink when the input is high. so here, this iih is equal to 40 μa. and here, the value of the ioh is equal to 400 μa. so this ioh is the maximum current that can be supplied by the logic gate when its output is high. so we can say that this high state fan-out is equal to ioh divided by iih. so here, the ioh is equal to 400 μa, while the iih is equal to 40 μa. that means the high state fan-out is also equal to 10. so we can say that for the ttl logic, when the output is high, then at the most, we can connect the 10 output loads. and of course, this is valid when the connected logic gates are also of the ttl logic family. but suppose, if we are connecting the other type of logic family at the output, then once again, we need to check all these values for the other logic family. and according to those values, we can decide how many logic gates that we can connect at the output side. but for the ttl logic gates, the value of this high state and low state fan-out is equal to 10. so if we connect more than these logic gates at the output, then the performance of the logic gate is not guaranteed. so that is the noise margin and the fan-out of the ttl gates. so i hope in this video, you understood how this ttl circuit works and what is the voltage transfer characteristic of the ttl inverter. and moreover, i hope you also understood, how the noise margin and the fan-out can be calculated for the ttl circuits. so once we understood the working of the basic ttl inverter, so similarly in the next video, we will see the circuits of the other ttl logic gates, like the nor gate, nand gate and the other logic gates. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.","ttl logic explained ttl inverter circuit noise margin and fanout of ttl circuits hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the transistor-transistor logic which is also commonly known as the ttl. so the logic gates which we have seen so far are designed using the different ic technologies, which is also known as the logic families. so the common logic families which are typically used in the ic fabrication are rtl, dtl, ttl, ecl and cmos. so these logic families or the ic technology which is used in designing these logic gates determines their characteristics like the speed, voltage levels, fan-out and power consumption. so some of the logic families like the rtl and the dtl are nowadays obsolete. but the other logic families like the ttl, ecl and the cmos are still in use. so in the earlier videos, we have already seen the cmos logic. so similarly, in this video, we will learn about the ttl logic. so as its name suggests, this ttl logic is based on the bipolar junction transistor. so every logic family has a defined range of input and output voltages that can be considered as either logic high or the logic low. so in case of the ttl logic, any input voltage between 0 to 0.8 v can be considered as the logic 0, while any input voltage between 2 v to 5 v can be considered as the logic 1. similarly for the output, any output voltage between 2.4 v to 5 v will be considered as the logic high, while any output voltage between 0 to 0.4 v will be considered as the logic low. so now lets see the circuit of the ttl logic gate. so this is the internal circuit of the ttl inverter. so in this video, what we will do, we will understand the working of this ttl logic gate with the help of this inverter circuit and in the next video, we will see that how to design the other ttl logic gates like the nand gate, nor gate and the other logic gates. so if you see the voltage transfer characteristic of this ttl inverter, then this is how it will look like. so this voltage transfer characteristic basically shows as the input changes, then how the output voltage changes. so in digital circuits, these logic gates are used in these two regions. so when the input is low, then the output is high, and it will be more than 3.6 v. and similarly, when the input is more than 2 v, then the output is typically around 0.2 v. and this can be considered as the logic low. so to understand how this ttl circuit works, first we should understand the different stages of the ttl circuit. so in this ttl circuit, the first stage is known as the current steering part. so basically, this part directs the current either towards the input side or towards the base of the transistor q2, depending on the input voltage. then if you see the next part, then that is known as the phase splitter. so basically, this part generates the two output voltages, which are complement of each other. that means whenever the one output is increasing, at that time, the other output is reducing. for example, when the input voltage is increased from the low to high, at that time, the voltage at the collector of the q2 starts reducing, and at the same time, the voltage at the emitter of this q2 will increase. and these two outputs drive the final stage of the ttl circuit, that is known as the totem pole. because here, the two transistors q3 and q4 are stacked on each other like the totem pole. so here, since they are fed through the phase splitter outputs, so at any given time, only one of the transistors will be on. so it will get clear to you when we see the working of the ttl circuit. so first, lets see how this circuit will work whenever the input is low. so lets say, this input is equal to 0.2v. because we have just seen that for the ttl logic, when the input is between 0 to 0.8v, then it can be considered as the logic 0. so for this input, lets see how this circuit will behave. so here, i am assuming that you are already aware about the basics of the bjt. and in case, if you are not aware, then please go through the basics of the bjt. or for that, you can watch this playlist. alright, so now, when the input is 0.2v, then this base-emitter junction of the q1 will become forward biased. because here, the voltage applied to the base is equal to vcc or the 5v. while if we see the voltage at the emitter, then that is equal to 0.2v. that means here, the base emitter junction of the q1 will become forward biased. that means now, if we see the voltage at the base, then that would be equal to 0.2 0.7v. or roughly it is equal to 0.9v. so now, if we see the collector base junction of the q1, then it will be also forward biased. because here, this transistor is the npn transistor. and here, the voltage at this node will be close to 0v. so here, for this transistor q1, both base-emitter junction and the collector-base junction will get forward biased. and therefore, this q1 will operate in the saturation. so here, since this q1 is operating in the saturation region, so the small amount of current is going away from the base of the q2. moreover, the base of the q2 does not have sufficient voltage to turn on this transistor q2. and therefore, in this condition, only small amount of current will flow in this direction. and through this 4 kω resistor, the majority of the current will flow in this direction. that means in this condition, the q2 will be off. and since the q2 is off, so the drop across this resistor r3 will also be equal to 0. and therefore, the base of the q4 will not have sufficient voltage to turn it on. and therefore, this transistor q4 will also remain in the off condition. so in this condition, since the q2 and q4 are off, so the voltage at this node will be close to vcc. so here, this is the output node, and through the load, it is connected to the ground terminal. so here, to forward bias this base-emitter junction of the transistor q3, the voltage at this node should be equal to vbe of the q3 plus the drop across the diode. that means it should be roughly equal to 1.4 v. and here, since it is more than that, so the base emitter junction of the q3 will get forward biased. that means in this condition, the q3 will be in the on condition. and through this path, the current will flow in the base of the q3. and if we see the voltage at the output node, then that is roughly equal to 3.6 v. that means vbe minus the drop across the base emitter junction minus the drop across the diode. but here, lets determine whether the collector base junction of the q3 is forward biased or reverse biased. so if it is reverse biased, then the q3 will operate in the active region. and if it is forward biased, then the q3 will operate in the saturation. so for this collector base junction to be forward biased, the voltage at the collector should be at least 0.6 to 0.7 v less than the base voltage. right? so here if you see, then the base voltage is close to vcc. so we can say that, that is roughly equal to 5 v. that means here, the voltage at the collector should be around 4.2 to 4.3 v. so if that is the case, then this base-collector junction is forward biased, otherwise it is reverse biased. so here, the drop across the diode is roughly around 0.7 v. that means here, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is equal to 3.6 plus 0.7 v. that is equal to 4.3 v. that means here, the voltage at the emitter of this transistor q3 is roughly equal to 4.3 v. moreover, here if we assume that this q3 is operating in the saturation, in that condition also, the minimum voltage drop across the vce will be equal to 0.2 v. so in that case, if we see the voltage at the collector, then that would be equal to this 4.3 v 0.2 v. that is equal to 4.5 v. so if that is the case, then the difference in voltage between the base and the collector would be less than 0.7 v. and due to that, this base collector junction will not get forward biased. because here, the voltage difference between the base and the collector is not able to cross the 0.6 to 0.7 v. so, we can say that here this collector base junction is operating in the reverse biased condition. and therefore, we can say that here this transistor q3 is operating in the active region. so we can say that when the input voltage is low, then the output voltage is around 3.6 v. and as we have seen, it can be considered as the logic high. so in this way, when the input to this ttl inverter is low, then its output will be high. so we can say that in this voltage transfer characteristic, in this region, when the input is low, at that time, this q1 is in the saturation, while the q2 and q4 will remain in the off condition. and similarly, if we see the transistor q3, then it will be on and it will operate in the active region. so similarly, lets see how this inverter circuit works when the input is high. so lets say, the input to the inverter is equal to 3.6 v. because this input voltage can be considered as the logic high. right? so when the input is 3.6 v, then the same will also appear at the emitter of the transistor q1. now here, through this resistor r1, this 5 v is connected to the base of the q1. but here, the voltage at the base will not go beyond 2.1 v. so lets see why. so here, initially, lets assume that this base emitter junction gets forward biased. and due to that, the voltage at this node is equal to 3.6 v plus 0.7 v. that is roughly equal to 4.3 v. and due to that, this collector base junction will also get forward biased. so in that case, the voltage at this node will be equal to 4.3 minus 0.6 v. that is roughly equal to 3.7 v. so here, if the voltage at the base of the q2 is equal to 3.7 v, then the base emitter junction of the q2 will also get forward biased. and if we see the voltage over here, or at the emitter of the transistor q2, then that is roughly equal to 3 v. so this voltage will also appear directly between the base emitter of the q4. that means here, the base emitter junction of the q4 will also get forward biased. and if that is the case, then the voltage between these two nodes will not be more than the 0.7 or the 0.75 v. right? so due to that, what will happen, this q4 will be in the on condition, and it will operate in the saturation. and if we see the voltage at the vbe of the q4, then that will be around 0.75 v. similarly, this q2 will also operate in the saturation. and therefore, the vbe of the q2 will also be around 0.75 v. that means if we see the voltage at the base of the q2, then that is roughly equal to 1.5 v. and since the collector base junction of the q1 is forward biased, so the voltage at the base of the q1 will be roughly equal to this 1.5 v plus 0.6 v. that is roughly equal to 2.1 v. that means here, if this q2 and q4 is in the on condition, and they are operating in the saturation, then the voltage at the base of the q1 will not go beyond the 2.1 v. because as you know, when the transistor is in the on condition, then its base emitter voltage cannot go beyond the 0.7 or the 0.75 v. that means here, the base of the q1 will not go beyond the 2.1 v. and therefore, when this input is high, then this base emitter junction of the q1 will get reverse biased. so typically, when the transistor is operating in the active region, at that time, this base emitter junction is forward biased and the collector base junction is reverse biased. but here, it is exactly opposite to that. that means here, the q1 will operate in the reverse active region. and due to that, through this r1, the current will flow into the base of the q2 instead of going in the other direction. so now, the q2 and q4 will operate in the saturation, and because of that, the large amount of current will flow into the collector of the q2. so due to this flow of current, the voltage drop across the r2 will be more. and due to that, now the voltage at the base of the q3 will be less, and it will not be enough to turn on this q3. so lets approximately find out what is the voltage at the base of the q3. so here, the emitter current of the q2 will get divided in two parts. so some current will flow through this resistor, while the remaining current will flow into the base of the q4. and here, the drop across this 1k resistor would be around 0.75 v. and here, since the q4 is operating in the saturation, so this voltage vce or the output will be roughly around 0.2 v. similarly, since the q2 is also operating in the saturation, so this voltage vce will also be roughly around 0.25 v. and therefore, if we see the voltage at this node, then that is roughly equal to 1 v. so this voltage will not be sufficient to turn on this transistor q3. because here, if the output is 0.2 v, then to turn on this transistor q3, we will require this 0.2 v plus the drop across this diode that is 0.7 v, plus the drop across the vbe, that is one more 0.7 v. so we can say that to turn on this transistor q3, we will roughly require this 0.2 v plus 1.4 v. that is roughly equal to 1.6 v. that means here, the q3 will remain in the off condition. and in this way, when the input to the ttl inverter is high, then the output will be low and it will be close to 0.2 v. so here, in this transfer characteristic if we see, then during this region of operation, the q1 will operate in the reverse active region, while the q2 and q4 will operate in the saturation. here if we see the transistor q3, then it will remain in the off condition. so that is how this circuit works as the ttl inverter. that means when the input is low, then the output is high. and when the input is high, then the output is low. but now, let us also see, when the input is between this range, then how the output changes. so as you can see, up to certain input voltage, this output almost remains constant up to 3.6 v. so basically, it will remain constant until this q2 gets turned on. so for that, first of all, lets see when this q2 will get turned on. so here, this q2 will be in the on condition when the voltage at the base of the q2 is more than 0.7 v. so it will happen when the input is more than 0.6 v. so lets say, the input is equal to 0.7 v. so when it is 0.7 v, then the base of the q1 will be at 1.4 v. right? and if we see the voltage at the collector, then that is roughly equal to 0.8 v. because here, when the input is around 0.7 v, at that time, this base emitter junction gets forward biased. and due to that, the voltage at the base will be roughly around 1.4 v. and similarly, since the collector base junction is also get forward biased, so the voltage at the collector or the voltage at the base of the q2 will be roughly around 0.8 v. that means once again, here this q1 is operating in the saturation. because here, both base emitter junction and the collector base junctions are forward biased. and since it is operating in the saturation, so the drop between the collector and the emitter would be roughly around 0.1 to 0.2 v. so we can say that when the voltage at the input is more than 0.6 v, then the voltage at the base of the q2 will be slightly more than 0.7 v. and due to that, this base emitter junction of the q2 will get forward biased. so as it gets forward biased, then the current will start flowing through the base of the q2. so earlier if you see, then when the input was less than 0.6 v, at that time, the majority of the current was flowing into the input side via this r1. but now, some of the current will get diverted towards the base of the q2. and since the current starts flowing through the base of the q2, so due to that, we will also get some emitter current. and because of that, the voltage will start getting build up across this resistor r3. but until the voltage drop across the r3 is not more than 0.7 v, this q4 will remain in the off condition. so here, since there is some flow of current through the collector of the q2, so due to that, there will be a more voltage drop across the r2. and because of that, the voltage at the base of the q3 will reduce. and effectively, the output voltage will also reduce. because we know that this vout is equal to this vb minus 1.4 v. so as the vb reduces, then the output voltage will also reduce. so we can say that when the input voltage is more than 0.6 v, at that time, this q2 and q3 will be in the on condition, while the q4 will be in the off condition. that means in this region of operation, the q1 is operating in the saturation, while the q2 and q3 will operate in the active region. and if we see the q4, then it will remain in the off condition. so until this q4 is off, this output voltage will reduce at the fixed rate with the increase in the input voltage. but once the q4 gets turned on, this output voltage will reduce even at the faster rate. so first, lets see when this q4 will get turned on. and once it is turned on, then how the output voltage will fall sharply. so here, this q4 will get turned on when the voltage across the r3 is more than 0.6 v. so as soon as this voltage reaches the 0.65 v, then the base-emitter junction of the q4 will get forward biased. and for that to happen, lets find out the required input voltage. so lets say the voltage across the base emitter junction of the q4 is equal to 0.65 v. and lets say across this transistor q2, the voltage is also equal to 0.65 v. that means if we see the voltage at the base of the q2, then that is equal to roughly 1.3 v. and here if we subtract the drop across the transistor q1, then the input voltage should be more than 1.2 v. because here, the q1 is operating in the saturation right now. so we can say that when the input is more than 1.2 v, at that time this q4 will get turned on. and now it will also start drawing the current through the emitter of the q2. that means effectively, now the emitter current of the q2 will increase. so further, if we increase this input voltage, then effectively the voltage which is appearing at the base of the q2 will increase. and due to that, the base current as well as the collector current of the q2 will increase. and due to that, now the drop across the resistor r2 will further increase. and due to that drop, now the voltage which is appearing at the base of the q3 will further reduce. or effectively, we can say that now the output voltage will fall more sharply. so due to that, here we are seeing the sharp fall. and after a certain increase in the voltage drop across the resistor r2, the voltage at the base of the q3 will not be sufficient to keep the transistor q3 in the on condition. and due to that, now the q3 will also go in the off state. so we can say that during this region of operation, the q1 will still operate in the saturation, while the q2 will operate in the active region. moreover, the q4 will also get turned on. and as soon as it gets turned on, then the q3 will go from the on to off state. so now, during this region of operation, with the further little increase in the input voltage, the voltage at the base of the q2 will increase. and due to that, the emitter current of the q2 will further increase. and since the part of the emitter current is directly going into the base of the q4, so first, this q4 will go into the saturation. and as it goes into the saturation, then the output voltage will further reduce, and it will be close to 0.2 v. so, we can say that when the input is more than 1.45 v, then assuming this base emitter junction is forward biased, the voltage at the base of the q1 will be roughly equal to 2.15 v. and here, since the collector-base junction is also forward biased, so the voltage over here will be roughly equal to 1.5 v. so, around at this voltage, this collector- base junction of the q2 will also get forward biased, and now this q2 will also operate in the saturation. so now, around at this voltage, both q2 and q4 are operating in the saturation. and in this condition, the q3 will go in the off state. and here, now the output voltage is close to 0.2 v. so now, if we further increase the input voltage, then as we have seen, the voltage at the base of the q1 will not go beyond the 2.15 v. so, we can say that the voltage at the base of the q1 is restricted to around 2.1 to 2.15 v. so when the input voltage goes above this 1.5 v, at that time, this base emitter junction of the q1 will get reverse biased. that means whenever the input is more than this, then this base emitter junction of the q1 will get reversed biased. and at the same time, this collector base junction will get forward biased. so in this condition, this q1 will operate in the reverse active region. so that is the case when we consider the input as the high. so we have seen that in this region of operation, the q1 is operating in the reverse active region, while the q2 and q4 are operating in the saturation region. and at the same time, this q3 remains in the off condition. so that is the voltage transfer characteristic of the ttl inverter. and keeping these voltages in mind, the upper and lower limits of the ttl inputs and outputs are defined. so for this ttl logic, this vil is equal to 0.8 v. that is the maximum input voltage that can be considered as the logic 0. similarly, if we see the vol, then that is equal to 0.4 v. that is the maximum output voltage that can be considered as the logic 0. so as per this voltage transfer characteristic, when the input is between 0 to 0.8 v, at that time, the output is always more than 3 v. that means whenever the input is between 0 to 0.8 v, at that time, you will surely get the desired result. but here, conservatively, this range is kept from 2.4 v to 5 v. because during the fabrication, the values of the resistor, as well as the characteristic of this transistor, might differ slightly from batch to batch. so keeping that tolerance in mind, these input and output voltage ranges are defined. so for the ttl logic, if we see the low state noise margin, then that is equal to 0.4 v. because here, the vil is equal to 0.8 v, while the vol is equal to 0.4 v. that means the low state noise margin is equal to 0.4 v. well, what is noise margin, i have already covered earlier in the separate video. so here, i am not going into the detail. but for more info, you can check that video. similarly, if we see the high state, then here, this vih is equal to 2 v. so this vih is the minimum input voltage that can be considered as the logic high. and similarly, this voh is equal to 2.4 v. that is the minimum output voltage that can be considered as the logic high. so as per this voltage transfer characteristic, when the input is equal to 2 v, at that time, the output is around 0.2 v. or we can say that, that is equal to logic 0. that means whenever the input is equal to vih, at that time also, the circuit will work properly. and here if you observe, then even at 1.5 v also, we are getting the logic 0. but considering all tolerances, this ttl range is kept more conservatively. so now, if we see the high state noise margin, then that is equal to voh minus vih. so here, this voh is equal to 2.4 v. and similarly, if we see the vih then that is equal to 2 v. that means for this ttl logic, this high state noise margin is also equal to 0.4 v. so we can say that for this ttl logic, both the high state and low state noise margin is equal to 0.4 v. so similarly, now lets see the fanout for this ttl logic circuit. so as we have seen, the fanout defines the maximum number of other logic gates that can be connected at the output of the logic gate. so for the ttl logic family, these are the maximum allowed values of the input and the output currents. so when the output of the logic gate is low, then the logic gate sinks the current. and when the output is high, then it will source the current. so here, when the output is low, then the logic gate will sink the current from the other logic gates. and at that time, the other logic gates will source that current. so this iil is the maximum current that can flow out of the logic gate when its input is low. for example, if we consider this inverter, then for this inverter, when the input is low, lets say a 0.2 v, at that time, the voltage at the base will be roughly around 0.9 v. and the current that is flowing in this direction will be roughly equal to this 4 v divided by 4 kω, that is equal to 1 ma. so the maximum value that can flow in this direction is defined as 1.6 ma. similarly, this iol is equal to 16 ma. so this iol is the maximum current that the logic gate can sink when its output is low. so as i said, when the output of the logic gate is low, then it will sink the current from the other logic gates. so here, the maximum allowed value of this current is equal to 16 ma. that means here, this output can sink maximum up to 16 ma of current. and we have seen that each logic gate can supply maximum up to 1.6 ma of current. so from this, we can say that the low-state fan-out for these ttl circuits is equal to iol divided by iil. so here, the iol is equal to 16 ma, while the iil is equal to 1.6 ma. and therefore, the low-state fan-out is equal to 10. that means whenever the input of the logic gate is low, at that time, maximum we can connect up to 10 loads. so similarly, lets see the high state fan-out. so for that, we need to see the ioh and the iih. so this ioh is the maximum current that the logic gate can source when its output is high. so for example, when this output is high, then it will supply the current. and this current will flow through the other logic gates. that means the other logic gates which are connected at the output of this logic gate will sink that current. so for the input side, the maximum current limit is defined as the iih. that is equal to 40 μa. that is the maximum current that the ttl logic gate can sink when the input is high. so here, this iih is equal to 40 μa. and here, the value of the ioh is equal to 400 μa. so this ioh is the maximum current that can be supplied by the logic gate when its output is high. so we can say that this high state fan-out is equal to ioh divided by iih. so here, the ioh is equal to 400 μa, while the iih is equal to 40 μa. that means the high state fan-out is also equal to 10. so we can say that for the ttl logic, when the output is high, then at the most, we can connect the 10 output loads. and of course, this is valid when the connected logic gates are also of the ttl logic family. but suppose, if we are connecting the other type of logic family at the output, then once again, we need to check all these values for the other logic family. and according to those values, we can decide how many logic gates that we can connect at the output side. but for the ttl logic gates, the value of this high state and low state fan-out is equal to 10. so if we connect more than these logic gates at the output, then the performance of the logic gate is not guaranteed. so that is the noise margin and the fan-out of the ttl gates. so i hope in this video, you understood how this ttl circuit works and what is the voltage transfer characteristic of the ttl inverter. and moreover, i hope you also understood, how the noise margin and the fan-out can be calculated for the ttl circuits. so once we understood the working of the basic ttl inverter, so similarly in the next video, we will see the circuits of the other ttl logic gates, like the nor gate, nand gate and the other logic gates. so if you have any question or

30KLkeL0_DY,Series Resonance Vs Parallel Resonance #resonance,2025-01-02 17:36:55+00:00,2025,1,Thursday,"In this short video, we will understand the basic difference between the  series and the parallel resonance. So, as you know, the resonance is the condition in the RLC circuit where at a specific frequency, this capacitive and the inductive reactance are equal in the magnitude. And due to that, the resulting impedance of the circuit will be purely resistive. So, this series resonance can be seen in the series RLC circuit where the inductive and the capacitive reactance are connected in the series connection. And similarly, this parallel resonance is seen in the parallel RLC circuit  where the capacitor and the inductors are connected in the parallel connection. So, this is the overall impedance of the series RLC circuit and at resonance, this inductive and the capacitive reactance will be same. So, they will cancel out each other and due to that, at resonance, the overall impedance of the circuit will be minimum. Moreover, it will be also purely resistive. So, for this series RLC circuit, if we see the impedance versus frequency curve,  then it will look like this. That means at resonance, the circuit will be purely resistive. So, the frequency at which this resonance occurs is known as the resonant frequency. So, if we go beyond this resonant frequency, then this series RLC circuit will  be inductive in nature. And below this resonant frequency, the circuit will be capacitive. So, in this series RLC circuit, at resonance, since the impedance is minimum, so the current in the circuit will be maximum. And if we see the current versus frequency curve, then this is how it will look like. And this is the expression of the resonant frequency. Similarly, for this parallel RLC circuit, this is the equivalent admittance of the circuit. So, at resonance, this inductive and the capacitive susceptance will cancel out each other and therefore, the admittance of the circuit will be minimum. Or in other words, we can say that the impedance of the circuit will be maximum. And this impedance will be purely resistive. So for this parallel RLC circuit, this is how the impedance curve will look like. So below the resonant frequency, this parallel RLC circuit will be inductive in nature. While beyond the resonant frequency, if we see, then the circuit will be  capacitive in nature. Now, in this parallel resonance, since at the resonance, the impedance is maximum,  so if we see the current curve, then this is how it will look like. That means at the resonance, the current in the circuit will be minimum. And once again, this is the expression of the resonant frequency. Now here, the sharpness of this impedance curve depends on the Q factor. So for this series RLC circuit, this Q factor is equal to ωL divided by R. While for the parallel RLC circuit, that is exactly opposite. And if we see the bandwidth of this resonant curve, then it can be given as  this  ωr divided by Q.

see the current curve, then this is how it will look like. that means at the resonance, the current in the circuit will be minimum. and once again, this is the expression of the resonant frequency. now here, the sharpness of this impedance curve depends on the q factor. so for this series rlc circuit, this q factor is equal to ωl divided by r. while for the parallel rlc circuit, that is exactly opposite. and if we see the bandwidth of this resonant curve, then it can be given as this ωr divided by q. so that is the quick comparison between the series and the parallel resonance.",-0.08176641,0.002450712,0.01142575,0.0017244279,-0.013199356,0.024508081,-0.059935905,0.05158149,0.10882937,-0.014777579,-0.02628228,-0.01594321,0.12187518,-0.012616044,-7.0145936e-05,-0.0032387974,-0.017222466,0.0230208,-0.010089034,-0.03134387,-0.036319662,-0.059013035,-0.025210181,0.035211693,-0.078723826,0.062225565,-0.01591158,0.045243327,-0.0155323595,0.0035316984,-0.015555019,-0.0067828023,-0.02792387,-0.038667012,-0.104174115,-0.055546697,-0.06631691,0.02674183,-0.001830725,0.005353262,-0.041606005,0.07383679,0.058399882,0.032109994,-0.032837026,-0.03015601,-0.077460594,-0.02994454,-0.006998819,-0.08573475,0.010981587,0.0016263925,-0.07251526,0.057459623,0.037934005,0.0393286,-0.08398062,-0.03359962,0.0012321032,0.06636233,0.019324744,-0.09158092,-0.02644711,0.063517645,0.04097545,0.039011676,0.07714654,0.009501574,0.06891539,-0.046906404,0.0469876,-0.07097364,-0.005228534,-0.02287838,0.09304414,0.013557016,-0.027467595,0.100624815,-0.007332706,0.026780993,-0.030791465,-0.044487357,-0.039603163,-0.03783914,-0.040193316,-0.078158595,-0.048776757,-0.11127417,-0.036307756,0.00072731235,0.09371815,0.01600797,-0.020868778,-0.022451706,-0.08830627,0.025444329,-0.0118018845,0.02693619,0.0138505725,0.015727038,0.04850445,-0.050185345,0.035602532,-0.014822274,-0.0017190601,-0.06958474,0.040044215,-0.026391646,-0.09759711,-0.009486637,-0.005547232,0.02301981,-0.041677658,0.084154196,-0.021458944,-0.05443012,0.042651962,-0.0347279,0.031243572,-0.07988654,0.032188646,-0.042021226,-0.042904977,-0.06512123,0.08382705,-0.09681033,-0.058907326,1.33549245e-33,-0.045526408,0.02108581,0.02559167,-0.08451992,0.013115714,-0.06970317,0.0369506,0.093305655,-0.006821543,0.022773879,0.00047212964,0.010208288,0.035988476,-0.014600604,-0.025849212,0.0018300241,0.027232483,-0.05697615,-0.034865458,-0.01741658,0.06186548,0.045487963,0.11933869,0.05109096,-0.0053993356,-0.038914464,-0.01726624,0.00073446915,-0.053358126,0.008545333,-0.010328315,0.042344462,0.027025945,0.05493859,-0.034343906,0.014173608,0.023312122,-0.041265987,0.042765137,0.07071168,-0.050977636,-0.008121237,-0.09719306,0.100714676,0.03152246,-0.0029470823,-0.0035124044,-0.019623375,0.060306232,0.057920914,-0.027438242,-0.029033126,0.021827174,0.032102317,0.04758277,0.07928622,0.033409365,-0.008411417,-0.03235467,0.009663699,-0.0693516,-0.011455272,-0.027365565,0.037578907,0.01744636,0.014236814,-0.036161114,-0.018487703,0.012643719,-0.01568437,0.079830535,0.011782604,-0.030380432,0.0119635835,0.08214608,-0.0044373674,-0.020477515,0.042423077,0.053864,0.078651026,-0.12066096,0.033477917,-0.04899342,0.12577792,-0.032289334,-0.02063294,0.14512269,0.0022995372,0.05324459,-0.06973094,0.06042341,0.010401747,0.095377974,0.014452541,0.073944144,-3.2399497e-33,0.09473431,-0.053549748,0.081097335,0.018686764,0.10183252,-0.035856366,-0.03054832,-0.0033413363,-0.018142818,0.00026398458,0.13169397,0.027642673,-0.100291975,0.065737784,-0.108232245,-0.06733497,0.0821961,-0.061303504,-0.0013891528,-0.017481642,0.018078668,0.0205342,-0.015142149,-0.03690663,-0.050996047,-0.049827907,-0.018880296,-0.059642848,0.07208626,0.035680458,0.020331142,0.08580965,0.03233901,-0.05618934,0.033763893,0.10886989,0.026567467,0.014107255,-0.059965674,0.06948584,0.052665383,-0.015883865,-0.04958995,-0.01824646,-0.021596089,-0.050419364,0.019689836,0.022085875,0.001369401,0.002441068,0.07103532,-0.008205983,0.056263905,0.0022162527,0.041233025,-0.0025553098,0.1000757,-0.058431115,0.049662285,-0.06352494,-0.06448525,-0.031011466,-0.1371403,-0.033091072,-0.024087468,0.042174354,-0.017040344,-0.058438413,0.049762953,0.00639229,-0.0635721,-0.019722054,0.019108225,-0.08614555,-0.026816862,-0.039731853,-0.06420737,-0.08418847,0.010705859,-0.055502392,0.024394799,0.01727558,-0.027465614,-0.038277484,-0.06959877,-0.07202181,-0.03573931,-0.030483404,-0.036309876,-0.0077732224,0.03395395,0.056494188,0.008055052,0.016503466,0.0876797,-4.7461068e-08,0.019928414,-0.01343556,-0.07210267,-0.005904128,0.12239686,-0.00042080646,-0.023423476,-0.14229985,-0.032436777,0.07739174,0.03254729,0.038099606,0.0030875592,0.005888294,-0.054928005,0.13869047,-0.004743619,-0.03720912,0.013801119,0.022411983,-0.02162219,0.038603615,-0.07513304,-0.0834345,0.007132097,-0.009375551,-0.055231053,0.042591948,-0.0826851,-0.0029304118,0.04882904,-0.06214832,8.591185e-05,-0.033333186,0.035656694,-0.023643926,0.04327076,-0.03285207,-0.024719525,-0.03537956,-0.034284193,-0.010754329,-0.009463792,0.044110205,0.027161911,-0.052563574,-0.028922463,0.04770391,-0.041412324,0.011407798,-0.070327796,-0.0748558,0.039378207,-0.0529586,-0.0043302504,0.03228678,0.040775176,-0.0037155098,0.02660474,0.052403554,0.027175792,0.021000804,0.12570505,-0.013187239
YUHeZ8QWTVo,Booth&#39;s Algorithm for Multiplication Explained (with Examples),2024-12-24 05:56:57+00:00,2024,12,Tuesday,"Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So in this video, we will learn about the Booth Multiplier. And we will understand the Booth's algorithm for the serial multiplication. So in the previous video, we have seen that how to perform the binary multiplication  using the add and shift method. And then after, we have seen the circuit for that, as well as we have also seen the simulation. So we have seen that this binary multiplication using this add and shift method, we will require the 4 ADD as well as the 4 SHIFT operations. Or in general, we can say that for multiplying the two N-bit numbers, we will require the N arithmetic operations as well as the N shift operations. So typically, to perform the one arithmetic operation, it will require the one clock cycle. And similarly, the one clock cycle will be required for the shift operation. So for example, if we are multiplying the two 32-bit numbers, then we will require the 32 clock cycles for the arithmetic operations and the 32 clock cycles for the shift operation. Or in general, we will require the 64 clock cycles. That means as the N increases, then the required number of ADD and shift  operations will also increase. And due to that, the required time for getting the result will also increase. But using some algorithms, it is possible to reduce the number of arithmetic  operations during this multiplication. And one such algorithm is the Booth's algorithm for the serial multiplication. So in this video, through a couple of examples, we will understand that how this  Booth's algorithm works, and using that, how we can reduce the execution time. So in the serial multiplication using this add and shift method, what we are doing,  we are comparing the each bit of the multiplier at a time. So if that bit is 0, then we are adding the 0 to the accumulator. And if that is 1, then we are adding the multiplicand to the accumulator. And after that, we are performing the right shift operation. But in the Booth's algorithm, instead of comparing the single bit, we will compare  the two bits at a time. That is Q0 and Q-1. So here, first we will compare these two bits, and then in the next iteration,  we will compare the Q0 with the Q1. And later on, we will compare this Q1 with the Q2. And based on these two bits, we will perform either add, subtract, or the shift operation. So initially, when the multiplication process starts, at that time,  this Q-1 bit will be set to 0. And based on this Q0 and Q-1 bits, the multiplicand is either added or subtracted from the accumulator. And initially, this accumulator or this A register is also set to 0. So here, if this Q0 and Q-1 are 00 or 11, then the no addition will be performed. And in that case, directly we will perform the shift operation. On the other end, if this Q0 and Q-1 are 01, then the A + M will be performed. And the result will be once again stored in this A register. On the other end, if this Q0 and Q-1 bits are 10, in that case, this subtraction will be performed. And after this addition or subtraction, we will have this right shift operation. So here, this right shift operation will be the arithmetic right shift operation. While, if you see the earlier case, then in this earlier case of add and shift method, we were doing the logical shift operation. And in this way, after the each right shift operation, the next pair of bits in the multiplier will be checked. So, in this method, whenever there is multiple 1s or 0s in the multiplier, then there is no need to perform the arithmetic operation. And in this way, we can reduce the required time for the multiplication. Now, another advantage of this Booth's algorithm is that it also works for the signed numbers. That means using this algorithm, we can also multiply the signed numbers. And at the same time, we can reduce the execution time. So now using this algorithm, let's see how to multiply the two signed numbers. So here, these signed numbers are represented in the 2s complement form. So here, this 1010 corresponds to -6, while this 0101 corresponds to 5. And we know that when we multiply the -6 and the 5, then the result will be equal to -30. And in the 2s complement form, it can be represented like this. So like I said, when the multiplication process starts, at that time, initially, this accumulator and this Q-1 bit will be set to 0. And then after, this multiplicand and the multipliers will be loaded in this M and the Q registers respectively. And after that, the multiplication process will start. So let's understand how this Booth's multiplication algorithm will work. So here, like I said, this Q is equal to 1010, while the multiplicand is equal to 0101. And this should be the answer, right? Now during this multiplication process, depending on the Q0 and the Q-1 bits,  we might perform the addition or the subtraction. That means during the multiplication process, we also require the subtraction. That is equal to A - M. And we know that this A - M is equivalent of adding the A with the 2s complement of the M. So let's say, the 2s complement of the M is equal to M bar. And here, that will be equal to 1011. That means the A - M is equivalent of A + M-bar. That means here, during the multiplication process, wherever we need to perform the  A - M, at that time, we will perform this A + M-bar. So here, since we are performing the 4-bit multiplication, so this accumulator and this Q registers will be of the 4 bits. And initially, this A and the Q-1 will be set to 0. So in the first iteration, this Q-1 and the Q0 bits will be checked. And here, since they are 0, so no arithmetic operation will be performed. And directly, we will perform the arithmetic right shift operation. So as you know, in the arithmetic right shift operation, the MSB will be copied as it is, and after that, all the bits will be shifted to the right side by a 1-bit position. So now, after the first right shift operation, once again, this Q0 and the Q-1 bits will be checked. So now if you see, then that is equal to 10. That means now, the subtraction will be performed. And that is equal to A + M-bar. That means now, the M-bar will be added with the current value of the A register. So after the addition, we will get this 1011. And here, this Q and the Q-1 will be copied as it is. So after this addition, or in a way, after this subtraction, once again, the right shift operation will be performed. So after this arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of this A, Q as well as the Q-1. So so far, only two times, this Q0 and the Q-1 bits have been checked. But here, since it is a 4-bit multiplication, so this process will be repeated two more times. So now, if we check the Q0 and the Q-1 bits for the third time, then that is equal to 01. So now, the A + M will be performed. That means now, this multiplicand will be added with the current value of the A register. And after the addition, this will be the value of the A register. So here, during the addition, if there is any carry generated, then that will be neglected. So here if you see, then this 1+1 is equal to 0. And there will be a carry of the 1. So this 1 will come over here. And then, if we move to the next column, then once again,  here this 1+ 1 is equal to 0. And there will be a carry of the 1. So once again, this 1 + 1 is 0. And there will be a carry of the 1. So here, this carry will be neglected. So we can say that, this will be the content of the A register. And here, this Q and the Q-1 will remain as it is. So here, after this addition, once again, the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. And after that, this will be the content of the A, Q as well as the Q-1. So after this third right shift operation, once again, this Q0 and the Q-1 bits will be checked. And now if you see, then that is equal to 10. That means once again, the A - M will be performed. Or in other words, this M-bar will be added with the current value of the A register. So after the addition, if we see, then the value of the A will be equal to 1100. And during the addition, if there is any carry, then that will be neglected. And once again, here the content of the Q and the Q-1 will remain as it is. So, after the addition, once again, the right shift operation will be performed. And after the arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of the A, Q and the Q-1. So here, the content of the A and the Q will represent the final output. That is equal to 11100010. And in the 2's complement form, that is equivalent to -30. So as you can see, in this Booth's algorithm, in each iteration, this Q0 and Q-1 will be compared. And based on that, either addition, subtraction, or no arithmetic operation will be performed. And after checking that, the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. So here, whenever there is a consecutive 0's or 1's in the multiplier, at that time, we can avoid the arithmetic right shift operation. And in this way, it is possible to perform the multiplication process a little faster. So for a better understanding, let's take a couple of more examples. So in this second example, if we see the multiplier, then that is equal to 0111. And the multiplicand is equal to 1001. That means if we see the value of the Q, then that is equal to 7,  while the multiplicand is equal to - 7. And the answer will be equal to - 49. Or in the 2's complement form, that is equal to 11001111. So as you can see, in the multiplier, since we have consecutive 1's, so as per this Booth's algorithm, the required number of arithmetic operations will be less. So once again, during this multiplication process, since we might require subtraction, so let's also find the M-bar. That is the 2's complement of the M. And in this case, that will be equal to 0111. So once again, here since we are performing the 4-bit multiplication, so the length of the A and the Q registers will be of the 4 bits. And if we see the final partial product, then it will be of the 8 bits. So initially, this A and Q-1 will be set to 0. And now, the bits Q0 and Q-1 will be checked. So here, since they are 1, 0, so the subtraction will be performed. That is equal to A-M, or equivalently, the M-bar will be added with the current value of the A register. So after the addition, the content of the A register will be equal to 0111. And here, the Q and Q-1 will remain as it is. So after the addition, the first arithmetic right-shift operation will be performed. That means here, the MSB will be kept as it is, and after that, all the bits will be right-shifted by the 1-bit position. So after the first right-shift operation, if we see the content of the Q0 and Q-1, then that is equal to 11. That means here, no arithmetic operations will be performed. And directly, we will perform the arithmetic right-shift operation. That means now, after the arithmetic right-shift operation,  this will be the new content of the A, Q and Q-1. And once again, now this Q0 and Q-1 bits will be compared. So once again, since they are 1, 1, so no arithmetic operations will be performed. And directly, we will perform the right-shift operation. So after the third arithmetic right-shift operation, this will be the content of the A, Q and Q-1. And now, last time, this Q0 and Q-1 bits will be compared. So now if you see, then they are 01. That means now, the multiplicand will be added with the current value of the A register. And after the addition, this will be the value of the A register. That is equal to 1001. And here, the content of the Q and Q-1 will remain as it is. And after this addition, once again, the final arithmetic right-shift operation will be performed. So after this arithmetic right-shift operation, this will be the content of the A, Q and Q-1. And here, the content of this A and Q register will represent the final output. That is equal to 11001111. Or in the 2's complement form, that is equal to -49. So as you can see, in this case, we have performed the 4 shift operations, and we have performed only 2 arithmetic operations. And in this way, we can reduce the processing time. So now, let's quickly see the third example, where both the multiplier and the multiplicand are positive. So here, the multiplier is equal to 0110, and the multiplicand is also equal to 0110. Or in the decimal, that is equal to 6. So after the multiplication, the answer should be equal to 36. Or in the 2's complement form, that is equal to 0110 0100. So once again, since we might require the M-bar, so for that,  let's also find the 2's complement of the M. So here, the 2's complement of the M is equal to 1010. And now, let's start the multiplication process. So here, first this A and Q-1 will be set to 0. And first, this Q0 and Q-1 bits will be checked. So here, since they are 0, so no arithmetic operation will be performed. And directly, we will perform the arithmetic right shift operation. So after the first arithmetic right shift operation,  this will be the content of the A, Q and Q-1. And now, once again after the shift operation, this Q0 and Q-1 bits will be checked. So at the second time if we see, then that is equal to 10. And since they are 10, so now this A-M will be performed. That is equivalent of adding the M-bar with the current value of the A register. So after the addition, the new value of the a register will be equal to 1010. And here, the Q and Q-1 will remain as it is. So after this addition, once again, this arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. And after this right shift operation, this will be the content of the A, Q and Q-1. So here, the second right shift operation will complete the second iteration. And now, for the third iteration, once again, this Q0 and Q-1 bits will be checked. So since they are 11, so in this third iteration, no addition will be performed. And directly, we will perform the right shift operation. So after the third arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of the A, Q and Q-1. So in this way, the three iterations have been completed. And now, for the fourth iteration, once again, this Q0 and Q-1 bits will be checked. So now if you see, then that is equal to 01. And therefore, now the addition will be performed. That means now, this multiplicand will be added with the current value of the A register. So after the addition, this will be the content of the A register. And during the addition, if any carry is generated, then that will be neglected. At the same time, the content of the Q and Q-1 will remain as it is. So after the addition, once again, now the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. That means here, the MSB will be copied as it is. And now, all the bits will be right shifted by the 1-bit position. So here, this fourth right shift operation will complete the fourth iteration. And after this fourth iteration, the content of the A and Q register represents the final output that is equal to 0010 0100. And in the 2's complement form, that is equal to 36. So in this way, using this Booth's algorithm,  it is possible to perform the multiplication of the signed numbers. So as we have seen, in this Booth's algorithm, for the N-bit multiplication, we are going through the N iterations. And in each iteration, we are checking this Q0 and Q-1 bits. And based on these two bits, we are deciding  whether the arithmetic operation will be required or not. And after that, we are performing the arithmetic right shift operation. That means here, as per this Booth's algorithm, while multiplying the two N-bit numbers, we will require the N-shift operations. And the required number of arithmetic operations will  depend on the value of the Q0 and Q-1 bits. Or basically, it will depend on the pattern of the multiplier bits. So in the multiplier, if there is a pattern of consecutive 1's or 0's, then as per this Booth's algorithm, it is possible to reduce the number of arithmetic operations. So that is the basic algorithm of the Booth's Multiplier. So now, let's see the basic block diagram of the Booth's Multiplier. And let's briefly understand how it can be implemented in the hardware. So this is the basic block diagram of the Booth's Multiplier. So here, for the multiplication, we will require the three N-bit registers. That is A, Q and M. Where A is the accumulator, and this  Q stores the multiplier. And similarly, this M register will store the multiplicand. So apart from that, there will be a circuit which will perform the 2's complement of the multiplicand. And that M bar will be stored in another register. So now, to perform this addition, here we will also have the arithmetic circuit. So here, based on this Q0 and Q-1 bits, this control circuit will decide whether we need to perform the addition or the subtraction. And accordingly, it will generate the selection input for the multiplier. That means if the M-bar is selected, then the subtraction will be performed. And if this M is selected, then the addition will be performed. And after the addition, the result will be stored back in this A register. And once this arithmetic operation is over, then the shift operation will be performed. So to perform this shift operation, this control unit will generate the command signal. So here, while checking this Q0 and Q-1 bits, if these 2 bits are either 00 or 11,  in that case, this control circuit will directly generate the control signal for the  right shift operation. And at the same time, this control unit will also count the number of iterations. So that is the basic block diagram of the Booth's Multiplier. So typically, in the embedded hardware, like in the FPGA, this multiplier circuit can be implemented easily. But probably in the upcoming videos, we will see that how the same can also be implemented using the discrete hardware. And I will also show you the simulation result for that implementation. But I hope in this video, you understood how the Booth's algorithm works. And what are the advantages of this Booth's algorithm over the conventional  add and shift method for the multiplication. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for more such videos.",booth39s algorithm for multiplication explained with examples,"hey friends, welcome to the youtube channel all about electronics. so in this video, we will learn about the booth multiplier. and we will understand the booths algorithm for the serial multiplication. so in the previous video, we have seen that how to perform the binary multiplication using the add and shift method. and then after, we have seen the circuit for that, as well as we have also seen the simulation. so we have seen that this binary multiplication using this add and shift method, we will require the 4 add as well as the 4 shift operations. or in general, we can say that for multiplying the two n-bit numbers, we will require the n arithmetic operations as well as the n shift operations. so typically, to perform the one arithmetic operation, it will require the one clock cycle. and similarly, the one clock cycle will be required for the shift operation. so for example, if we are multiplying the two 32-bit numbers, then we will require the 32 clock cycles for the arithmetic operations and the 32 clock cycles for the shift operation. or in general, we will require the 64 clock cycles. that means as the n increases, then the required number of add and shift operations will also increase. and due to that, the required time for getting the result will also increase. but using some algorithms, it is possible to reduce the number of arithmetic operations during this multiplication. and one such algorithm is the booths algorithm for the serial multiplication. so in this video, through a couple of examples, we will understand that how this booths algorithm works, and using that, how we can reduce the execution time. so in the serial multiplication using this add and shift method, what we are doing, we are comparing the each bit of the multiplier at a time. so if that bit is 0, then we are adding the 0 to the accumulator. and if that is 1, then we are adding the multiplicand to the accumulator. and after that, we are performing the right shift operation. but in the booths algorithm, instead of comparing the single bit, we will compare the two bits at a time. that is q0 and q-1. so here, first we will compare these two bits, and then in the next iteration, we will compare the q0 with the q1. and later on, we will compare this q1 with the q2. and based on these two bits, we will perform either add, subtract, or the shift operation. so initially, when the multiplication process starts, at that time, this q-1 bit will be set to 0. and based on this q0 and q-1 bits, the multiplicand is either added or subtracted from the accumulator. and initially, this accumulator or this a register is also set to 0. so here, if this q0 and q-1 are 00 or 11, then the no addition will be performed. and in that case, directly we will perform the shift operation. on the other end, if this q0 and q-1 are 01, then the a m will be performed. and the result will be once again stored in this a register. on the other end, if this q0 and q-1 bits are 10, in that case, this subtraction will be performed. and after this addition or subtraction, we will have this right shift operation. so here, this right shift operation will be the arithmetic right shift operation. while, if you see the earlier case, then in this earlier case of add and shift method, we were doing the logical shift operation. and in this way, after the each right shift operation, the next pair of bits in the multiplier will be checked. so, in this method, whenever there is multiple 1s or 0s in the multiplier, then there is no need to perform the arithmetic operation. and in this way, we can reduce the required time for the multiplication. now, another advantage of this booths algorithm is that it also works for the signed numbers. that means using this algorithm, we can also multiply the signed numbers. and at the same time, we can reduce the execution time. so now using this algorithm, lets see how to multiply the two signed numbers. so here, these signed numbers are represented in the 2s complement form. so here, this 1010 corresponds to -6, while this 0101 corresponds to 5. and we know that when we multiply the -6 and the 5, then the result will be equal to -30. and in the 2s complement form, it can be represented like this. so like i said, when the multiplication process starts, at that time, initially, this accumulator and this q-1 bit will be set to 0. and then after, this multiplicand and the multipliers will be loaded in this m and the q registers respectively. and after that, the multiplication process will start. so lets understand how this booths multiplication algorithm will work. so here, like i said, this q is equal to 1010, while the multiplicand is equal to 0101. and this should be the answer, right? now during this multiplication process, depending on the q0 and the q-1 bits, we might perform the addition or the subtraction. that means during the multiplication process, we also require the subtraction. that is equal to a - m. and we know that this a - m is equivalent of adding the a with the 2s complement of the m. so lets say, the 2s complement of the m is equal to m bar. and here, that will be equal to 1011. that means the a - m is equivalent of a m-bar. that means here, during the multiplication process, wherever we need to perform the a - m, at that time, we will perform this a m-bar. so here, since we are performing the 4-bit multiplication, so this accumulator and this q registers will be of the 4 bits. and initially, this a and the q-1 will be set to 0. so in the first iteration, this q-1 and the q0 bits will be checked. and here, since they are 0, so no arithmetic operation will be performed. and directly, we will perform the arithmetic right shift operation. so as you know, in the arithmetic right shift operation, the msb will be copied as it is, and after that, all the bits will be shifted to the right side by a 1-bit position. so now, after the first right shift operation, once again, this q0 and the q-1 bits will be checked. so now if you see, then that is equal to 10. that means now, the subtraction will be performed. and that is equal to a m-bar. that means now, the m-bar will be added with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, we will get this 1011. and here, this q and the q-1 will be copied as it is. so after this addition, or in a way, after this subtraction, once again, the right shift operation will be performed. so after this arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of this a, q as well as the q-1. so so far, only two times, this q0 and the q-1 bits have been checked. but here, since it is a 4-bit multiplication, so this process will be repeated two more times. so now, if we check the q0 and the q-1 bits for the third time, then that is equal to 01. so now, the a m will be performed. that means now, this multiplicand will be added with the current value of the a register. and after the addition, this will be the value of the a register. so here, during the addition, if there is any carry generated, then that will be neglected. so here if you see, then this 11 is equal to 0. and there will be a carry of the 1. so this 1 will come over here. and then, if we move to the next column, then once again, here this 1 1 is equal to 0. and there will be a carry of the 1. so once again, this 1 1 is 0. and there will be a carry of the 1. so here, this carry will be neglected. so we can say that, this will be the content of the a register. and here, this q and the q-1 will remain as it is. so here, after this addition, once again, the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. and after that, this will be the content of the a, q as well as the q-1. so after this third right shift operation, once again, this q0 and the q-1 bits will be checked. and now if you see, then that is equal to 10. that means once again, the a - m will be performed. or in other words, this m-bar will be added with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, if we see, then the value of the a will be equal to 1100. and during the addition, if there is any carry, then that will be neglected. and once again, here the content of the q and the q-1 will remain as it is. so, after the addition, once again, the right shift operation will be performed. and after the arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and the q-1. so here, the content of the a and the q will represent the final output. that is equal to 11100010. and in the 2s complement form, that is equivalent to -30. so as you can see, in this booths algorithm, in each iteration, this q0 and q-1 will be compared. and based on that, either addition, subtraction, or no arithmetic operation will be performed. and after checking that, the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. so here, whenever there is a consecutive 0s or 1s in the multiplier, at that time, we can avoid the arithmetic right shift operation. and in this way, it is possible to perform the multiplication process a little faster. so for a better understanding, lets take a couple of more examples. so in this second example, if we see the multiplier, then that is equal to 0111. and the multiplicand is equal to 1001. that means if we see the value of the q, then that is equal to 7, while the multiplicand is equal to - 7. and the answer will be equal to - 49. or in the 2s complement form, that is equal to 11001111. so as you can see, in the multiplier, since we have consecutive 1s, so as per this booths algorithm, the required number of arithmetic operations will be less. so once again, during this multiplication process, since we might require subtraction, so lets also find the m-bar. that is the 2s complement of the m. and in this case, that will be equal to 0111. so once again, here since we are performing the 4-bit multiplication, so the length of the a and the q registers will be of the 4 bits. and if we see the final partial product, then it will be of the 8 bits. so initially, this a and q-1 will be set to 0. and now, the bits q0 and q-1 will be checked. so here, since they are 1, 0, so the subtraction will be performed. that is equal to a-m, or equivalently, the m-bar will be added with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, the content of the a register will be equal to 0111. and here, the q and q-1 will remain as it is. so after the addition, the first arithmetic right-shift operation will be performed. that means here, the msb will be kept as it is, and after that, all the bits will be right-shifted by the 1-bit position. so after the first right-shift operation, if we see the content of the q0 and q-1, then that is equal to 11. that means here, no arithmetic operations will be performed. and directly, we will perform the arithmetic right-shift operation. that means now, after the arithmetic right-shift operation, this will be the new content of the a, q and q-1. and once again, now this q0 and q-1 bits will be compared. so once again, since they are 1, 1, so no arithmetic operations will be performed. and directly, we will perform the right-shift operation. so after the third arithmetic right-shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. and now, last time, this q0 and q-1 bits will be compared. so now if you see, then they are 01. that means now, the multiplicand will be added with the current value of the a register. and after the addition, this will be the value of the a register. that is equal to 1001. and here, the content of the q and q-1 will remain as it is. and after this addition, once again, the final arithmetic right-shift operation will be performed. so after this arithmetic right-shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. and here, the content of this a and q register will represent the final output. that is equal to 11001111. or in the 2s complement form, that is equal to -49. so as you can see, in this case, we have performed the 4 shift operations, and we have performed only 2 arithmetic operations. and in this way, we can reduce the processing time. so now, lets quickly see the third example, where both the multiplier and the multiplicand are positive. so here, the multiplier is equal to 0110, and the multiplicand is also equal to 0110. or in the decimal, that is equal to 6. so after the multiplication, the answer should be equal to 36. or in the 2s complement form, that is equal to 0110 0100. so once again, since we might require the m-bar, so for that, lets also find the 2s complement of the m. so here, the 2s complement of the m is equal to 1010. and now, lets start the multiplication process. so here, first this a and q-1 will be set to 0. and first, this q0 and q-1 bits will be checked. so here, since they are 0, so no arithmetic operation will be performed. and directly, we will perform the arithmetic right shift operation. so after the first arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. and now, once again after the shift operation, this q0 and q-1 bits will be checked. so at the second time if we see, then that is equal to 10. and since they are 10, so now this a-m will be performed. that is equivalent of adding the m-bar with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, the new value of the a register will be equal to 1010. and here, the q and q-1 will remain as it is. so after this addition, once again, this arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. and after this right shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. so here, the second right shift operation will complete the second iteration. and now, for the third iteration, once again, this q0 and q-1 bits will be checked. so since they are 11, so in this third iteration, no addition will be performed. and directly, we will perform the right shift operation. so after the third arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. so in this way, the three iterations have been completed. and now, for the fourth iteration, once again, this q0 and q-1 bits will be checked. so now if you see, then that is equal to 01. and therefore, now the addition will be performed. that means now, this multiplicand will be added with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, this will be the content of the a register. and during the addition, if any carry is generated, then that will be neglected. at the same time, the content of the q and q-1 will remain as it is. so after the addition, once again, now the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. that means here, the msb will be copied as it is. and now, all the bits will be right shifted by the 1-bit position. so here, this fourth right shift operation will complete the fourth iteration. and after this fourth iteration, the content of the a and q register represents the final output that is equal to 0010 0100. and in the 2s complement form, that is equal to 36. so in this way, using this booths algorithm, it is possible to perform the multiplication of the signed numbers. so as we have seen, in this booths algorithm, for the n-bit multiplication, we are going through the n iterations. and in each iteration, we are checking this q0 and q-1 bits. and based on these two bits, we are deciding whether the arithmetic operation will be required or not. and after that, we are performing the arithmetic right shift operation. that means here, as per this booths algorithm, while multiplying the two n-bit numbers, we will require the n-shift operations. and the required number of arithmetic operations will depend on the value of the q0 and q-1 bits. or basically, it will depend on the pattern of the multiplier bits. so in the multiplier, if there is a pattern of consecutive 1s or 0s, then as per this booths algorithm, it is possible to reduce the number of arithmetic operations. so that is the basic algorithm of the booths multiplier. so now, lets see the basic block diagram of the booths multiplier. and lets briefly understand how it can be implemented in the

this q stores the multiplier. and similarly, this m register will store the multiplicand. so apart from that, there will be a circuit which will perform the 2s complement of the multiplicand. and that

whether we need to perform the addition or the subtraction. and accordingly, it will generate the selection input for the multiplier. that means if the m-bar is selected, then the subtraction will be performed. and if this m is selected, then the addition will be performed. and after the addition, the result will be stored back in this a register. and once this arithmetic operation is over, then the shift operation will be performed. so to perform this shift operation, this control unit will generate the command signal. so here, while checking this q0 and q-1 bits, if these 2 bits are either 00 or 11, in that case, this control circuit will directly generate the control signal for the right shift operation. and at the same time, this control unit will also count the number of iterations. so that is the basic block diagram of the booths multiplier. so typically, in the embedded hardware, like in the fpga, this multiplier circuit can be implemented easily. but probably in the upcoming

number of add and shift operations will also increase. and due to that, the required time for getting the result will also increase. but using some algorithms, it is possible to reduce the number of arithmetic operations during this multiplication. and one such algorithm is the booths algorithm for the serial multiplication. so in this video, through a couple of examples, we will understand that

performing the right shift operation. but in the booths algorithm, instead of comparing the single bit, we will compare the two bits at a time. that is q0 and q-1. so here, first we will compare these two bits, and then in the next iteration, we will compare the q0 with the q1. and later on, we will compare this q1 with the q2. and based on these two bits, we will perform either add, subtract, or the shift operation. so initially, when the multiplication process starts, at that time, this q-1 bit will be set to 0. and based on this q0 and q-1 bits, the multiplicand is either added or subtracted from the accumulator. and initially, this accumulator or this a register is also set to 0. so here, if this q0 and q-1 are 00 or 11, then the no addition will be performed. and in that case, directly we will perform the shift operation. on the other end, if this q0 and q-1 are 01, then the a m will be performed. and the result will be once again stored in this a register. on the other end, if this q0 and q-1 bits are 10, in that case, this subtraction will be performed. and after this addition or subtraction, we will have this right shift operation. so here, this right shift operation will be the arithmetic right shift operation. while, if you see the earlier case, then in this earlier case of add and shift method, we were doing the logical shift operation. and in this way, after the each right shift operation, the next pair of bits in the multiplier will be checked. so, in this method, whenever there is multiple 1s or 0s in the multiplier, then there is no need to perform the arithmetic operation. and in this way, we can reduce the required time for the multiplication. now, another advantage of this booths algorithm is that it also works for the signed numbers. that means using this algorithm, we can also multiply the signed numbers. and at the same time, we can reduce the execution time. so now using this algorithm, lets see how to multiply the two signed numbers. so here, these signed numbers are represented in the 2s complement form. so here, this 1010 corresponds to -6, while this 0101 corresponds to 5. and we know that when we multiply the -6 and the 5, then the result will be equal to -30. and in the 2s complement form, it can be represented like this. so like i said, when the multiplication process starts, at that time, initially, this accumulator and this q-1 bit will be set to 0. and then after, this multiplicand and the multipliers will be loaded in this m and the q registers respectively. and after that, the multiplication process will start. so lets understand how this booths multiplication algorithm will work. so here, like i said, this q is equal to 1010, while the multiplicand is equal to 0101. and this should be the answer, right? now during this multiplication process, depending on the q0 and the q-1 bits, we might perform the addition or the subtraction. that means during the multiplication process, we also require the subtraction. that is equal to a - m. and we know that this a - m is equivalent of adding the a with the 2s complement of the m. so lets say, the 2s complement of the m is equal to m bar. and here, that will be equal to 1011. that means the a - m is equivalent of a m-bar. that means here, during the multiplication process, wherever we need to perform the a - m, at that time, we will perform this a m-bar. so here, since we are performing the 4-bit multiplication, so this accumulator and this q registers will be of the 4 bits. and initially, this a and the q-1 will be set to 0. so in the first iteration, this q-1 and the q0 bits will be checked. and here, since they are 0, so no arithmetic operation will be performed. and directly, we will perform the arithmetic right shift operation. so as you know, in the arithmetic right shift operation, the msb will be copied as it is, and after that, all the bits will be shifted to the right side by a 1-bit position. so now, after the first right shift operation, once again, this q0 and the q-1 bits will be checked. so now if you see, then that is equal to 10. that means now, the subtraction will be performed. and that is equal to a m-bar. that means now, the m-bar will be added with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, we will get this 1011. and here, this q and the q-1 will be copied as it is. so after this addition, or in a way, after this subtraction, once again, the right shift operation will be performed. so after this arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of this a, q as well as the q-1. so so far, only two times, this q0 and the q-1 bits have been checked. but here, since it is a 4-bit multiplication, so this process will be repeated two more times. so now, if we check the q0 and the q-1 bits for the third time, then that is equal to 01. so now, the a m will be performed. that means now, this multiplicand will be added with the current value of the a register. and after the addition, this will be the value of the a register. so here, during the addition, if there is any carry generated, then that will be neglected. so here if you see, then this 11 is equal to 0. and there will be a carry of the 1. so this 1 will come over here. and then, if we move to the next column, then once again, here this 1 1 is equal to 0. and there will be a carry of the 1. so once again, this 1 1 is 0. and there will be a carry of the 1. so here, this carry will be neglected. so we can say that, this will be the content of the a register. and here, this q and the q-1 will remain as it is. so here, after this addition, once again, the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. and after that, this will be the content of the a, q as well as the q-1. so after this third right shift operation, once again, this q0 and the q-1 bits will be checked. and now if you see, then that is equal to 10. that means once again, the a - m will be performed. or in other words, this m-bar will be added with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, if we see, then the value of the a will be equal to 1100. and during the addition, if there is any carry, then that will be neglected. and once again, here the content of the q and the q-1 will remain as it is. so, after the addition, once again, the right shift operation will be performed. and after the arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and the q-1. so here, the content of the a and the q will represent the final output. that is equal to 11100010. and in the 2s complement form, that is equivalent to -30. so as you can see, in this booths algorithm, in each iteration, this q0 and q-1 will be compared. and based on that, either addition, subtraction, or no arithmetic operation will be performed. and after checking that, the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. so here, whenever there is a consecutive 0s or 1s in the multiplier, at that time, we can avoid the arithmetic right shift operation. and in this way, it is possible to perform the multiplication process a little faster. so for a better understanding, lets take a couple of more examples. so in this second example, if we see the multiplier, then that is equal to 0111. and the multiplicand is equal to 1001. that means if we see the value of the q, then that is equal to 7, while the multiplicand is equal to - 7. and the answer will be equal to - 49. or in the 2s complement form, that is equal to 11001111. so as you can see, in the multiplier, since we have consecutive 1s, so as per this booths algorithm, the required number of arithmetic operations will be less. so once again, during this multiplication process, since we might require subtraction, so lets also find the m-bar. that is the 2s complement of the m. and in this case, that will be equal to 0111. so once again, here since we are performing the 4-bit multiplication, so the length of the a and the q registers will be of the 4 bits. and if we see the final partial product, then it will be of the 8 bits. so initially, this a and q-1 will be set to 0. and now, the bits q0 and q-1 will be checked. so here, since they are 1, 0, so the subtraction will be performed. that is equal to a-m, or equivalently, the m-bar will be added with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, the content of the a register will be equal to 0111. and here, the q and q-1 will remain as it is. so after the addition, the first arithmetic right-shift operation will be performed. that means here, the msb will be kept as it is, and after that, all the bits will be right-shifted by the 1-bit position. so after the first right-shift operation, if we see the content of the q0 and q-1, then that is equal to 11. that means here, no arithmetic operations will be performed. and directly, we will perform the arithmetic right-shift operation. that means now, after the arithmetic right-shift operation, this will be the new content of the a, q and q-1. and once again, now this q0 and q-1 bits will be compared. so once again, since they are 1, 1, so no arithmetic operations will be performed. and directly, we will perform the right-shift operation. so after the third arithmetic right-shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. and now, last time, this q0 and q-1 bits will be compared. so now if you see, then they are 01. that means now, the multiplicand will be added with the current value of the a register. and after the addition, this will be the value of the a register. that is equal to 1001. and here, the content of the q and q-1 will remain as it is. and after this addition, once again, the final arithmetic right-shift operation will be performed. so after this arithmetic right-shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. and here, the content of this a and q register will represent the final output. that is equal to 11001111. or in the 2s complement form, that is equal to -49. so as you can see, in this case, we have performed the 4 shift operations, and we have performed only 2 arithmetic operations. and in this way, we can reduce the processing time. so now, lets quickly see the third example, where both the multiplier and the multiplicand are positive. so here, the multiplier is equal to 0110, and the multiplicand is also equal to 0110. or in the decimal, that is equal to 6. so after the multiplication, the answer should be equal to 36. or in the 2s complement form, that is equal to 0110 0100. so once again, since we might require the m-bar, so for that, lets also find the 2s complement of the m. so here, the 2s complement of the m is equal to 1010. and now, lets start the multiplication process. so here, first this a and q-1 will be set to 0. and first, this q0 and q-1 bits will be checked. so here, since they are 0, so no arithmetic operation will be performed. and directly, we will perform the arithmetic right shift operation. so after the first arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. and now, once again after the shift operation, this q0 and q-1 bits will be checked. so at the second time if we see, then that is equal to 10. and since they are 10, so now this a-m will be performed. that is equivalent of adding the m-bar with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, the new value of the a register will be equal to 1010. and here, the q and q-1 will remain as it is. so after this addition, once again, this arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. and after this right shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. so here, the second right shift operation will complete the second iteration. and now, for the third iteration, once again, this q0 and q-1 bits will be checked. so since they are 11, so in this third iteration, no addition will be performed. and directly, we will perform the right shift operation. so after the third arithmetic right shift operation, this will be the content of the a, q and q-1. so in this way, the three iterations have been completed. and now, for the fourth iteration, once again, this q0 and q-1 bits will be checked. so now if you see, then that is equal to 01. and therefore, now the addition will be performed. that means now, this multiplicand will be added with the current value of the a register. so after the addition, this will be the content of the a register. and during the addition, if any carry is generated, then that will be neglected. at the same time, the content of the q and q-1 will remain as it is. so after the addition, once again, now the arithmetic right shift operation will be performed. that means here, the msb will be copied as it is. and now, all the bits will be right shifted by the 1-bit position. so here, this fourth right shift operation will complete the fourth iteration. and after this fourth iteration, the content of the a and q register represents the final output that is equal to 0010 0100. and in the 2s complement form, that is equal to 36. so in this way, using this booths algorithm, it is possible to perform the multiplication of the signed numbers. so as we have seen, in this booths algorithm, for the n-bit multiplication, we are going through the n iterations. and in each iteration, we are checking this q0 and q-1 bits. and based on these two bits, we are deciding whether the arithmetic operation will be required or not. and after that, we are performing the arithmetic right shift operation. that means here, as per this booths algorithm, while multiplying the two n-bit numbers, we will require the n-shift operations. and the required number of arithmetic operations will depend on the value of the q0 and q-1 bits. or basically, it will depend on the pattern of the multiplier bits. so in the multiplier, if there is a pattern of consecutive 1s or 0s, then as per this booths algorithm, it is possible to reduce the number of arithmetic operations. so that is the basic algorithm of the booths multiplier. so now, lets see the basic block diagram of the booths multiplier. and lets briefly understand how it can be implemented in the hardware. so this is the basic block diagram of the booths multiplier. so here, for the multiplication, we will require the three n-bit registers. that is a, q and m. where a is the accumulator, and this q stores the multiplier. and similarly, this m register will store the multiplicand. so apart from that, there will be a circuit which will perform the 2s complement of the multiplicand. and that m bar will be stored in another register. so now, to perform this addition, here we will also have the arithmetic circuit. so here, based on this q0 and q-1 bits, this control circuit will decide whether we need to perform the addition or the subtraction. and accordingly, it will generate the selection input for the multiplier. that means if the m-bar is selected, then the subtraction will be performed. and if this m is selected, then the addition will be performed. and after the addition, the result will be stored back in this a register. and once this arithmetic operation is over, then the shift operation will be performed. so to perform this shift operation, this control unit will generate the command signal. so here, while checking this q0 and q-1 bits, if these 2 bits are either 00 or 11, in that case, this control circuit will directly generate the control signal for the right shift operation. and at the same time, this control unit will also count the number of iterations. so that is the basic block diagram of the booths multiplier. so typically, in the embedded hardware, like in the fpga, this multiplier circuit can be implemented easily. but probably in the upcoming videos, we will see that how the same can also be implemented using the discrete hardware. and i will also show you the simulation result for that implementation. but i hope in this video, you understood how the booths algorithm works. and what are the advantages of this booths algorithm over the conventional add and shift method for the multiplication. so if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. if you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe to the

T18TmFTCDWQ,How to Generate 90 Degree Phase Shifted Signals using Flip-Flop ? | Digital Electronics,2024-12-05 04:58:11+00:00,2024,12,Thursday,"In this short video, let's see how to generate the 90-degree phase shift between the two digital signals using the flip-flops. So as you know, if we connect the Q-bar output of the D flip-flop back to the input side, and if we observe the output, then it is changing between 1 and 0 continuously  at the every clock pulse. And this is how the output will look like. And if we see the Q-bar output, then it is 180-degree phase shifted with respect to the Q output. But now let's see, by modifying this circuit, how we can generate the two signals, which are 90-degree phase shifted with respect to each other. So for that, we need another flip-flop. But in this case, the second flip-flop should be the negative edge triggered flip-flop. And the output of the first flip-flop should be connected to the input of the second flip-flop. So with this arrangement, it is possible to generate the second signal, which is 90-degree phase shifted with respect to the first signal. So now let's see, how it will work. So here, this is the clock signal. And as I said, when we connect the Q-bar output of the D flip-flop back to the  input side, then the output will toggle at the every clock edge. So here, this Q1 output will toggle at the every rising edge. And now this output is connected as an input to the second flip-flop. But now, since the second flip-flop is the negative edge-triggered flip-flop, so it will respond to this output at the falling edge. That means here if you observe, then at the first falling edge, this Q1 output is equal to 1. Therefore, this Q2 output will also go high. And now, if you see at the second falling edge, then this Q1 output is equal to low. That means now, this Q2 output will also become low. That means in this way, this second flip-flop will follow the first flip-flop at the every falling edge. And in this way, it is possible to generate the 90° phase shift, provided the duty cycle of the clock signal is equal to 50%. So if that is the case, then this Q1 and Q2 will be phase shifted with respect to each other by the 90°. So now, instead of the negative edge-triggered flip-flop, suppose we have a positive edge-triggered flip-flop, then in that case, we need to apply the clock signal to the second flip-flop via the inverter. And here, we are assuming that the delay of this inverter is negligible. So in this way, it is possible to generate the two signals, which are 90° phase shifted with respect to each other. Apart from this, using a 2-bit twisted ring counter, or using the 2-bit Johnson counter also, it is possible to generate the two signals, which are 90° phase shifted  with respect to each other. Because as you know, the N-bit Johnson counter has the 2N states. And here if you observe, then the each output of the flip-flop is phase shifted from each other by (360° /2N) degree. So for example, if we have a 2-bit Johnson counter, then the outputs are phase shifted from each other by the 90°. On the other hand, if we have a 4-bit Johnson counter, then each flip-flop in this Johnson counter is phase shifted from each other by the 45°. And in this way, using these simple circuits, it is possible to generate the different phase shifted digital signals. So for more information about this Johnson counter, you can check this video.",how to generate 90 degree phase shifted signals using flip-flop ? digital electronics,"in this short video, lets see how to generate the 90-degree phase shift between the two digital signals using the flip-flops. so as you know, if we connect the q-bar output of the d flip-flop back to the input side, and if we observe the output, then it is changing between 1 and 0 continuously at the every clock pulse. and this is how the output will look like. and if we see the q-bar output, then it is 180-degree phase shifted with respect to the q output. but now lets see, by modifying this circuit, how we can generate the two signals, which are 90-degree phase shifted with respect to each other. so for that, we need another flip-flop. but in this case, the second flip-flop should be the negative edge triggered flip-flop. and the output of the first flip-flop should be connected to the input of the second flip-flop. so with this arrangement, it is possible to generate the second signal, which is 90-degree phase shifted with respect to the first signal. so now lets see, how it will work. so here, this is the clock signal. and as i said, when we connect the q-bar output of the d flip-flop back to the input side, then the output will toggle at the every clock edge. so here, this q1 output will toggle at the every rising edge. and now this output is connected as an input to the second flip-flop. but now, since the second flip-flop is the negative edge-triggered flip-flop, so it will respond to this output at the falling edge. that means here if you observe, then at the first falling edge, this q1 output is equal to 1. therefore, this q2 output will also go high. and now, if you see at the second falling edge, then this q1 output is equal to low. that means now, this q2 output will also become low. that means in this way, this second flip-flop will follow the first flip-flop at the every falling edge. and in this way, it is possible to generate the 90 phase shift, provided the duty cycle of the clock signal is equal to 50. so if that is the case, then this q1 and q2 will be phase shifted with respect to each other by the 90. so now, instead of the negative edge-triggered flip-flop, suppose we have a positive edge-triggered flip-flop, then in that case, we need to apply the clock signal to the second flip-flop via the inverter. and here, we are assuming that the delay of this inverter is negligible. so in this way, it is possible to generate the two signals, which are 90 phase shifted with respect to each other. apart from this, using a 2-bit twisted ring counter, or using the 2-bit johnson counter also, it is possible to generate the two signals, which are 90 phase shifted with respect to each other. because as you know, the n-bit johnson counter has the 2n states. and here if you observe, then the each output of the flip-flop is phase shifted from each other by 360 2n degree. so for example, if we have a 2-bit johnson counter, then the outputs are phase shifted from each other by the 90. on the other hand, if we have a 4-bit johnson counter, then each flip-flop in this johnson counter is phase shifted from each other by the 45. and in this way, using these simple circuits, it is possible to generate the different phase shifted digital signals. so for more information about this johnson counter, you can check this video.","how to generate 90 degree phase shifted signals using flip-flop ? digital electronics in this short video, lets see how to generate the 90-degree phase shift between the two digital signals using the flip-flops. so as you know, if we connect the q-bar output of the d flip-flop back to the input side, and if we observe the
