The boy, do I have the product for you. The   boy, do I have the product for you. The story here is I was visiting the story here is I was visiting the   story here is I was visiting the warehouse for DFTBA, and I had this warehouse for DFTBA, and I had this   warehouse for DFTBA, and I had this product that's like a little plushy pie product that's like a little plushy pie   product that's like a little plushy pie creature. A lot of people asked for it. creature. A lot of people asked for it.   creature. A lot of people asked for it. It's very fun. And one of the people in It's very fun. And one of the people in   It's very fun. And one of the people in the warehouse was just kind of playing the warehouse was just kind of playing   the warehouse was just kind of playing around with it and putting it around around with it and putting it around   around with it and putting it around their neck and saying, ""Oh, this would their neck and saying, ""Oh, this would   their neck and saying, ""Oh, this would actually make kind of a nice pillow."" actually make kind of a nice pillow.""   actually make kind of a nice pillow."" and it was a joke, but we just ran with and it was a joke, but we just ran with   and it was a joke, but we just ran with the concept and went through a couple the concept and went through a couple   the concept and went through a couple different iterations and landed on what different iterations and landed on what   different iterations and landed on what is a surprisingly comfortable neck is a surprisingly comfortable neck   is a surprisingly comfortable neck pillow actually. And it's absurd and I'm pillow actually. And it's absurd and I'm   pillow actually. And it's absurd and I'm very tickled by the idea that a Three very tickled by the idea that a Three   very tickled by the idea that a Three Blue and Brown fan might be in the Blue and Brown fan might be in the   Blue and Brown fan might be in the airport with this thing hanging off airport with this thing hanging off   airport with this thing hanging off their bag and someone who's not in the their bag and someone who's not in the   their bag and someone who's not in the know would just be very confused by why know would just be very confused by why   know would just be very confused by why the neck pillow has a little arm and the neck pillow has a little arm and   the neck pillow has a little arm and eyeballs and everything.

And today I want to show you exactly how it looks to use this tool to exactly how it looks to use this tool to   exactly how it looks to use this tool to study differential equations and analyze study differential equations and analyze   study differential equations and analyze dynamic systems. For context, this is dynamic systems. For context, this is   dynamic systems. For context, this is the third chapter in a sequence all the third chapter in a sequence all   the third chapter in a sequence all about this lelass transform. And as a about this lelass transform. And as a   about this lelass transform. And as a very quick recap, in the first chapter, very quick recap, in the first chapter,   very quick recap, in the first chapter, you and I became acquainted with you and I became acquainted with   you and I became acquainted with functions that look like e to the s * t, functions that look like e to the s * t,   functions that look like e to the s * t, where s is a complex number. And the where s is a complex number. And the   where s is a complex number. And the output of these functions kind of output of these functions kind of   output of these functions kind of spirals through the complex plane. The spirals through the complex plane. The   spirals through the complex plane. The key concept you have to have in your key concept you have to have in your   key concept you have to have in your mind is what engineers call the s plane mind is what engineers call the s plane   mind is what engineers call the s plane [music] which is the complex plane [music] which is the complex plane   [music] which is the complex plane representing all possible values of this representing all possible values of this   representing all possible values of this term s in the exponent. The idea is to term s in the exponent. The idea is to   term s in the exponent. The idea is to think of each point of the plane as think of each point of the plane as   think of each point of the plane as encoding the entire function e to the s encoding the entire function e to the s   encoding the entire function e to the s * t. And the primary takeaway is that * t. And the primary takeaway is that   * t. And the primary takeaway is that bigger imaginary values of s correspond bigger imaginary values of s correspond   bigger imaginary values of s correspond to functions with more oscillation than to functions with more oscillation than   to functions with more oscillation than negative real parts reflect decay and negative real parts reflect decay and   negative real parts reflect decay and positive real parts reflect growth. The positive real parts reflect growth. The   positive real parts reflect growth. The reason we care is that many functions in reason we care is that many functions in   reason we care is that many functions in nature can be broken down into nature can be broken down into   nature can be broken down into exponential pieces. So what we want is a exponential pieces. So what we want is a   exponential pieces. So what we want is a machine that exposes how that breakdown machine that exposes how that breakdown   machine that exposes how that breakdown looks. This is the key motivation for looks. This is the key motivation for   looks. This is the key motivation for what lelass transforms even are. And we what lelass transforms even are. And we   what lelass transforms even are. And we unpacked that in some detail through the unpacked that in some detail through the   unpacked that in some detail through the last chapter. Again, in the spirit of a last chapter. Again, in the spirit of a   last chapter. Again, in the spirit of a quick recap, the rough way this quick recap, the rough way this   quick recap, the rough way this transform looks is that it takes a transform looks is that it takes a   transform looks is that it takes a function of time and translates it into function of time and translates it into   function of time and translates it into a new language, turning it into a new a new language, turning it into a new   a new language, turning it into a new function whose input is this complex function whose input is this complex   function whose input is this complex number s. The key conclusion from last number s. The key conclusion from last   number s. The key conclusion from last time is that if your function really can time is that if your function really can   time is that if your function really can be broken into exponential pieces, then be broken into exponential pieces, then   be broken into exponential pieces, then when you plot this new transformed when you plot this new transformed   when you plot this new transformed version over the s plane, poles in that version over the s plane, poles in that   version over the s plane, poles in that plot correspond to the exponential plot correspond to the exponential   plot correspond to the exponential pieces hiding inside the original pieces hiding inside the original   pieces hiding inside the original function. Symbolically, function. Symbolically,   function. Symbolically, this amounts to two key properties that this amounts to two key properties that   this amounts to two key properties that I want you to remember. Number one, if I want you to remember. Number one, if   I want you to remember. Number one, if you pump in an exponential function, you pump in an exponential function,   you pump in an exponential function, something like e to the a * t, it something like e to the a * t, it   something like e to the a * t, it transforms into 1 / s minus a, an transforms into 1 / s minus a, an   transforms into 1 / s minus a, an expression which you should see in your expression which you should see in your   expression which you should see in your mind's eye as a function over the s mind's eye as a function over the s   mind's eye as a function over the s plane with a pole above the value a. plane with a pole above the value a.   plane with a pole above the value a. Number two, the transform is linear. Number two, the transform is linear.   Number two, the transform is linear. [music] [music]   [music] What this means is if you have a scaled What this means is if you have a scaled   What this means is if you have a scaled sum of functions and then you transform sum of functions and then you transform   sum of functions and then you transform them, it's the same as applying the them, it's the same as applying the   them, it's the same as applying the transform to each individual function transform to each individual function   transform to each individual function and taking that same scaled sum of the and taking that same scaled sum of the   and taking that same scaled sum of the results. So for example, if your results. So for example, if your   results. So for example, if your function going in really does look like function going in really does look like   function going in really does look like a combination of exponential terms, then a combination of exponential terms, then   a combination of exponential terms, then what comes out looks like this sum of what comes out looks like this sum of   what comes out looks like this sum of fractions, which you should read in your fractions, which you should read in your   fractions, which you should read in your mind as an expression with multiple mind as an expression with multiple   mind as an expression with multiple different poles. Each pole reflects one different poles. Each pole reflects one   different poles. Each pole reflects one of those exponential pieces. of those exponential pieces.   of those exponential pieces. These two properties alone already give These two properties alone already give   These two properties alone already give you a glimpse of why this is a helpful you a glimpse of why this is a helpful   you a glimpse of why this is a helpful tool for getting a qualitative sense for tool for getting a qualitative sense for   tool for getting a qualitative sense for the dynamics of some situation. If you the dynamics of some situation. If you   the dynamics of some situation. If you have some system evolving over time and have some system evolving over time and   have some system evolving over time and with techniques I'll show you shortly with techniques I'll show you shortly   with techniques I'll show you shortly you're able to find its lelass transform you're able to find its lelass transform   you're able to find its lelass transform then when you see poles in this then when you see poles in this   then when you see poles in this transform with imaginary values that transform with imaginary values that   transform with imaginary values that tells you hey there's some kind of tells you hey there's some kind of   tells you hey there's some kind of oscillation. If those poles have oscillation. If those poles have   oscillation. If those poles have negative real values, that indicates a negative real values, that indicates a   negative real values, that indicates a tendency to decay towards zero. But any tendency to decay towards zero. But any   tendency to decay towards zero. But any poles with a positive real part would poles with a positive real part would   poles with a positive real part would indicate instability, a tendency to indicate instability, a tendency to   indicate instability, a tendency to explode away from zero. Often when explode away from zero. Often when   explode away from zero. Often when you're studying physics, you don't know you're studying physics, you don't know   you're studying physics, you don't know immediately what function describes a immediately what function describes a   immediately what function describes a dynamic system, but you do know a dynamic system, but you do know a   dynamic system, but you do know a differential equation describing it. differential equation describing it.   differential equation describing it. What's neat is that there's a way to go What's neat is that there's a way to go   What's neat is that there's a way to go directly from such a differential directly from such a differential   directly from such a differential equation to the applause transform of equation to the applause transform of   equation to the applause transform of its solution. And this is useful both as its solution. And this is useful both as   its solution. And this is useful both as an intermediate step to finding an exact an intermediate step to finding an exact   an intermediate step to finding an exact solution you can circle on your page, solution you can circle on your page,   solution you can circle on your page, but also equally importantly, it's a but also equally importantly, it's a   but also equally importantly, it's a meaningful representation of the system meaningful representation of the system   meaningful representation of the system in its own right. The ability to do this in its own right. The ability to do this   in its own right. The ability to do this is going to rely on a third key property is going to rely on a third key property   is going to rely on a third key property that is worth remembering. One that that is worth remembering. One that   that is worth remembering. One that explains how exactly lelass transforms explains how exactly lelass transforms   explains how exactly lelass transforms can convert differential equations into can convert differential equations into   can convert differential equations into algebra, hence making them easier to algebra, hence making them easier to   algebra, hence making them easier to solve. Here's how it [music] looks. If solve. Here's how it [music] looks. If   solve. Here's how it [music] looks. If you take the derivative of some function you take the derivative of some function   you take the derivative of some function little f of t with respect to time and little f of t with respect to time and   little f of t with respect to time and then you take a lelass transform of that then you take a lelass transform of that   then you take a lelass transform of that derivative, the effect is the same as if derivative, the effect is the same as if   derivative, the effect is the same as if you had first applied the transform to you had first applied the transform to   you had first applied the transform to the original function and then the original function and then   the original function and then multiplied that result by s at least multiplied that result by s at least   multiplied that result by s at least almost. There's also this additional almost. There's also this additional   almost. There's also this additional term where you subtract off the initial term where you subtract off the initial   term where you subtract off the initial condition subtracting the value of your condition subtracting the value of your   condition subtracting the value of your original function little f at the time t original function little f at the time t   original function little f at the time t equals z. So in other words, the equals z. So in other words, the   equals z. So in other words, the transform turns differentiation in the transform turns differentiation in the   transform turns differentiation in the time domain into multiplication over in time domain into multiplication over in   time domain into multiplication over in the s domain. Now this should feel very the s domain. Now this should feel very   the s domain. Now this should feel very reminiscent of the fact that for reminiscent of the fact that for   reminiscent of the fact that for exponential functions differentiation in exponential functions differentiation in   exponential functions differentiation in time is the same as multiplication by s time is the same as multiplication by s   time is the same as multiplication by s and it's no coincidence. Ultimately the and it's no coincidence. Ultimately the   and it's no coincidence. Ultimately the underlying reason is the same. Now, at underlying reason is the same. Now, at   underlying reason is the same. Now, at first glance, when you look at this first glance, when you look at this   first glance, when you look at this rule, that little minus f of0 term might rule, that little minus f of0 term might   rule, that little minus f of0 term might seem like kind of an annoying quirk to seem like kind of an annoying quirk to   seem like kind of an annoying quirk to an otherwise very elegant equation. But an otherwise very elegant equation. But   an otherwise very elegant equation. But really, it's a feature, not a bug. As really, it's a feature, not a bug. As   really, it's a feature, not a bug. As you apply this to differential you apply this to differential   you apply this to differential equations, this little quirk means you equations, this little quirk means you   equations, this little quirk means you have a built-in way to account for have a built-in way to account for   have a built-in way to account for initial conditions. Now, I can hear you initial conditions. Now, I can hear you   initial conditions. Now, I can hear you asking, why is this property true? Where asking, why is this property true? Where   asking, why is this property true? Where does it come from? How exactly is this does it come from? How exactly is this   does it come from? How exactly is this connected to the idea of differentiating connected to the idea of differentiating   connected to the idea of differentiating an exponential? And where does that an exponential? And where does that   an exponential? And where does that minus f of0 term come from in the first minus f of0 term come from in the first   minus f of0 term come from in the first place? place?   place? I will of course explain this. In fact, I will of course explain this. In fact,   I will of course explain this. In fact, I can think of three ways to explain it. I can think of three ways to explain it.   I can think of three ways to explain it. But let's postpone those for just a But let's postpone those for just a   But let's postpone those for just a minute and instead dive into how you minute and instead dive into how you   minute and instead dive into how you actually use this property in practice. actually use this property in practice.   actually use this property in practice. The example I want to show starts with The example I want to show starts with   The example I want to show starts with the simple harmonic oscillator, which is the simple harmonic oscillator, which is   the simple harmonic oscillator, which is something you and I studied two chapters something you and I studied two chapters   something you and I studied two chapters ago, where you might imagine a mass on a ago, where you might imagine a mass on a   ago, where you might imagine a mass on a spring. [music] As a reminder, one spring. [music] As a reminder, one   spring. [music] As a reminder, one component of the force that acts on that component of the force that acts on that   component of the force that acts on that mass pulls it towards a middle position mass pulls it towards a middle position   mass pulls it towards a middle position with a strength that's proportional to with a strength that's proportional to   with a strength that's proportional to its distance away from that middle. We its distance away from that middle. We   its distance away from that middle. We write that as K * X. And it's also write that as K * X. And it's also   write that as K * X. And it's also common to include a damping force, which common to include a damping force, which   common to include a damping force, which acts by slowing down this mass's acts by slowing down this mass's   acts by slowing down this mass's movement with a [music] strength movement with a [music] strength   movement with a [music] strength proportional to its velocity, again proportional to its velocity, again   proportional to its velocity, again using some negative proportionality using some negative proportionality   using some negative proportionality constant. And then the algebra always constant. And then the algebra always   constant. And then the algebra always ends up looking very nice if we move all ends up looking very nice if we move all   ends up looking very nice if we move all of these terms to just one side of the of these terms to just one side of the   of these terms to just one side of the equation [music] like this. With no equation [music] like this. With no   equation [music] like this. With no further modification, this right here is further modification, this right here is   further modification, this right here is a very friendly linear equation. We a very friendly linear equation. We   a very friendly linear equation. We talked all about how to solve it simply talked all about how to solve it simply   talked all about how to solve it simply by substituting in e to the st, which by substituting in e to the st, which   by substituting in e to the st, which depending on your perspective is either depending on your perspective is either   depending on your perspective is either a frustratingly unmotivated guess or a frustratingly unmotivated guess or   a frustratingly unmotivated guess or that's just the established procedure that's just the established procedure   that's just the established procedure you do once you've learned the you do once you've learned the   you do once you've learned the fundamental fact that linear equations fundamental fact that linear equations   fundamental fact that linear equations like this always have an exponential like this always have an exponential   like this always have an exponential solution. That's all previous material, solution. That's all previous material,   solution. That's all previous material, but this time we're going to imagine but this time we're going to imagine   but this time we're going to imagine there is a third force acting on the there is a third force acting on the   there is a third force acting on the mass. Some kind of external force, which mass. Some kind of external force, which   mass. Some kind of external force, which in our example will oscillate back and in our example will oscillate back and   in our example will oscillate back and forth according to a cosine function, forth according to a cosine function,   forth according to a cosine function, like a wind with periodic gusts to the like a wind with periodic gusts to the   like a wind with periodic gusts to the left and to the right. Importantly, the left and to the right. Importantly, the   left and to the right. Importantly, the frequency of this external force will frequency of this external force will   frequency of this external force will generally have nothing to do with the generally have nothing to do with the   generally have nothing to do with the natural resonant frequency for the natural resonant frequency for the   natural resonant frequency for the spring. And this is not an arbitrary spring. And this is not an arbitrary   spring. And this is not an arbitrary example. that came up for us before on example. that came up for us before on   example. that came up for us before on this channel when we studied why light this channel when we studied why light   this channel when we studied why light slows down in a medium like glass. In slows down in a medium like glass. In   slows down in a medium like glass. In that context, once we were deep into the that context, once we were deep into the   that context, once we were deep into the video, the relevant oscillator was a video, the relevant oscillator was a   video, the relevant oscillator was a little charge inside the material and little charge inside the material and   little charge inside the material and the external force was an incoming light the external force was an incoming light   the external force was an incoming light wave. Faced with an equation like this, wave. Faced with an equation like this,   wave. Faced with an equation like this, which is no longer a linear equation, which is no longer a linear equation,   which is no longer a linear equation, it's more complicated to solve. Here's a it's more complicated to solve. Here's a   it's more complicated to solve. Here's a preview of the general strategy. What preview of the general strategy. What   preview of the general strategy. What you do is you take a lelass transform of you do is you take a lelass transform of   you do is you take a lelass transform of all of the terms and then you can solve all of the terms and then you can solve   all of the terms and then you can solve that result to reveal the transformed that result to reveal the transformed   that result to reveal the transformed version of the solution and then from version of the solution and then from   version of the solution and then from there you can invert the process to there you can invert the process to   there you can invert the process to recover that solution in our usual recover that solution in our usual   recover that solution in our usual language in the time domain instead of language in the time domain instead of   language in the time domain instead of the s domain. Okay, that's the highle the s domain. Okay, that's the highle   the s domain. Okay, that's the highle view but let's roll up our sleeves and view but let's roll up our sleeves and   view but let's roll up our sleeves and actually step through this piece by actually step through this piece by   actually step through this piece by piece. Following the usual convention, piece. Following the usual convention,   piece. Following the usual convention, I'm going to write the transform for I'm going to write the transform for   I'm going to write the transform for little x of t as capital x of s. And little x of t as capital x of s. And   little x of t as capital x of s. And then using the rule that we just talked then using the rule that we just talked   then using the rule that we just talked all about, the transform for its all about, the transform for its   all about, the transform for its derivative is going to look like s * derivative is going to look like s *   derivative is going to look like s * capital x all minus an initial capital x all minus an initial   capital x all minus an initial condition, which I'm going to write as condition, which I'm going to write as   condition, which I'm going to write as little x knot. And then for the second little x knot. And then for the second   little x knot. And then for the second derivative, what should that look like? derivative, what should that look like?   derivative, what should that look like? This is actually a good chance to pause This is actually a good chance to pause   This is actually a good chance to pause and try it out as an exercise. It and try it out as an exercise. It   and try it out as an exercise. It basically looks like applying that key basically looks like applying that key   basically looks like applying that key rule we just talked about, but twice in rule we just talked about, but twice in   rule we just talked about, but twice in a row. Applying it once you get that the a row. Applying it once you get that the   a row. Applying it once you get that the transform of the second derivative transform of the second derivative   transform of the second derivative should look like s * the transform of should look like s * the transform of   should look like s * the transform of the first derivative all minus x prime the first derivative all minus x prime   the first derivative all minus x prime of 0. That term is the same as the of 0. That term is the same as the   of 0. That term is the same as the initial velocity. So I'll write it as v initial velocity. So I'll write it as v   initial velocity. So I'll write it as v kn. This is where in the whole procedure kn. This is where in the whole procedure   kn. This is where in the whole procedure that part of the initial condition is that part of the initial condition is   that part of the initial condition is kind of automatically accounted for. And kind of automatically accounted for. And   kind of automatically accounted for.

If we add those together and factor out the whole capital x part, and factor out the whole capital x part,   and factor out the whole capital x part, what we're left with is a nice little what we're left with is a nice little   what we're left with is a nice little quadratic polomial. what would be very quadratic polomial. what would be very   quadratic polomial. what would be very clean and pretty as if that's all we clean and pretty as if that's all we   clean and pretty as if that's all we had.

The other poles of of the spring system. The other poles of   of the spring system. The other poles of our transformed function come from the our transformed function come from the   our transformed function come from the roots of this part right here, which are roots of this part right here, which are   roots of this part right here, which are omega and negative omega, [music] and omega and negative omega, [music] and   omega and negative omega, [music] and those correspond to the cosine external those correspond to the cosine external   those correspond to the cosine external force. In other words, another component force. In other words, another component   force. In other words, another component of the final dynamics, really the of the final dynamics, really the   of the final dynamics, really the dominant component in this case, is a dominant component in this case, is a   dominant component in this case, is a tendency to oscillate in sync with that tendency to oscillate in sync with that   tendency to oscillate in sync with that external force.

This might all make a little bit here. This might all make a little bit   here. This might all make a little bit more sense if I return back to that more sense if I return back to that   more sense if I return back to that simulation that I opened with that has a simulation that I opened with that has a   simulation that I opened with that has a graph on the top showing the position of graph on the top showing the position of   graph on the top showing the position of this mass on a spring over time.

What's going on here is that the force. What's going on here is that the   force. What's going on here is that the solution can be thought of as a sum of solution can be thought of as a sum of   solution can be thought of as a sum of two different components.

From this perspective, external force. From this perspective,   external force. From this perspective, you can recognize how that initial you can recognize how that initial   you can recognize how that initial period of wibbling about corresponds to period of wibbling about corresponds to   period of wibbling about corresponds to the time when that first component is the time when that first component is   the time when that first component is still relevant.

Well, if you do want an exact analytic Well, if you do want an exact analytic   Well, if you do want an exact analytic solution, this next part is not exactly solution, this next part is not exactly   solution, this next part is not exactly fun, but it is straightforward. If you fun, but it is straightforward. If you   fun, but it is straightforward. If you have a fraction like this one that we have a fraction like this one that we   have a fraction like this one that we found, and you know the roots of its found, and you know the roots of its   found, and you know the roots of its denominator, like the four roots that we denominator, like the four roots that we   denominator, like the four roots that we just discussed, you can break it up as a just discussed, you can break it up as a   just discussed, you can break it up as a sum of four fractions where the sum of four fractions where the   sum of four fractions where the denominator of each one looks like s denominator of each one looks like s   denominator of each one looks like s minus one of those roots. The work you minus one of those roots. The work you   minus one of those roots. The work you have to do goes into solving for these have to do goes into solving for these   have to do goes into solving for these constants up in the numerator. There's a constants up in the numerator. There's a   constants up in the numerator. There's a process for it. It's called partial process for it. It's called partial   process for it. It's called partial fraction decomposition. I'm not going to fraction decomposition. I'm not going to   fraction decomposition. I'm not going to walk through the details. I don't think walk through the details. I don't think   walk through the details. I don't think you want me to walk through the details, you want me to walk through the details,   you want me to walk through the details, but I'll leave up the key idea as a but I'll leave up the key idea as a   but I'll leave up the key idea as a little oncreen note. Once you do solve little oncreen note. Once you do solve   little oncreen note. Once you do solve for those constants, because you know for those constants, because you know   for those constants, because you know that an exponential term transforms into that an exponential term transforms into   that an exponential term transforms into a simple fraction like the ones we're a simple fraction like the ones we're   a simple fraction like the ones we're looking at, inverting the process looking at, inverting the process   looking at, inverting the process amounts to inverting that one key rule, amounts to inverting that one key rule,   amounts to inverting that one key rule, you turn each of these fractions into you turn each of these fractions into   you turn each of these fractions into the appropriate exponential term. So the the appropriate exponential term. So the   the appropriate exponential term. So the locations of each pole, those roots of locations of each pole, those roots of   locations of each pole, those roots of the denominator correspond to the values the denominator correspond to the values   the denominator correspond to the values in the exponents sitting in front of the in the exponents sitting in front of the   in the exponents sitting in front of the time t.

If you're the kind of person who likes If you're the kind of person who likes   If you're the kind of person who likes homework and enjoys digging into the homework and enjoys digging into the   homework and enjoys digging into the formulas and you choose to take on the formulas and you choose to take on the   formulas and you choose to take on the challenge of solving for those challenge of solving for those   challenge of solving for those constants, there's one very interesting constants, there's one very interesting   constants, there's one very interesting conclusion of that exercise I want you conclusion of that exercise I want you   conclusion of that exercise I want you to focus on. Look at the first two terms to focus on. Look at the first two terms   to focus on. Look at the first two terms corresponding to the poles omega i and corresponding to the poles omega i and   corresponding to the poles omega i and negative omega i. When you solve for the negative omega i. When you solve for the   negative omega i. When you solve for the two relevant constants, the expressions two relevant constants, the expressions   two relevant constants, the expressions you get are not quite the same. But if you get are not quite the same. But if   you get are not quite the same. But if mu is very close to zero, each one is mu is very close to zero, each one is   mu is very close to zero, each one is approximately this shared expression approximately this shared expression   approximately this shared expression that we can factor out. Now you know that we can factor out. Now you know   that we can factor out. Now you know that two imaginary exponentials like that two imaginary exponentials like   that two imaginary exponentials like this combine to make a cosine. So this this combine to make a cosine. So this   this combine to make a cosine. So this part you're looking at is that final part you're looking at is that final   part you're looking at is that final steady state cosine rhythm that the mass steady state cosine rhythm that the mass   steady state cosine rhythm that the mass eventually falls into. And inside that eventually falls into. And inside that   eventually falls into. And inside that big expression that you solve for, the big expression that you solve for, the   big expression that you solve for, the exercise I want to leave you with as exercise I want to leave you with as   exercise I want to leave you with as homework is to think deeply about how homework is to think deeply about how   homework is to think deeply about how the amplitude of this final expression the amplitude of this final expression   the amplitude of this final expression depends on the difference between the depends on the difference between the   depends on the difference between the resonant frequency of the spring and the resonant frequency of the spring and the   resonant frequency of the spring and the frequency of that external force.

In particular, what happens as both of particular, what happens as both of   particular, what happens as both of those frequencies get closer together? those frequencies get closer together?   those frequencies get closer together? And how might this be relevant to anyone And how might this be relevant to anyone   And how might this be relevant to anyone wishing to build a bridge that they wishing to build a bridge that they   wishing to build a bridge that they don't want to wobble into ruin? don't want to wobble into ruin?   don't want to wobble into ruin? stepping out from the trees to look over stepping out from the trees to look over   stepping out from the trees to look over the forest. You see what I mean about the forest. You see what I mean about   the forest. You see what I mean about how applause transforms can turn a how applause transforms can turn a   how applause transforms can turn a differential equation into algebra and differential equation into algebra and   differential equation into algebra and how it's all rooted in this third key how it's all rooted in this third key   how it's all rooted in this third key property where a derivative in time property where a derivative in time   property where a derivative in time turns into multiplication by s. So turns into multiplication by s. So   turns into multiplication by s. So naturally the burning question is why is naturally the burning question is why is   naturally the burning question is why is this property true in the first place? this property true in the first place?   this property true in the first place? And like I said I can think of three And like I said I can think of three   And like I said I can think of three different ways to explain it. One that's different ways to explain it. One that's   different ways to explain it. One that's elementary but limited, one that's elementary but limited, one that's   elementary but limited, one that's [music] general but a bit opaque. And [music] general but a bit opaque. And   [music] general but a bit opaque. And then there's my favorite, which requires then there's my favorite, which requires   then there's my favorite, which requires a little added theory to describe. The a little added theory to describe. The   a little added theory to describe. The first one is actually not a complete first one is actually not a complete   first one is actually not a complete explanation. The idea is that anytime explanation. The idea is that anytime   explanation. The idea is that anytime you see a new formula in math, it's you see a new formula in math, it's   you see a new formula in math, it's never a bad idea to just try it out on never a bad idea to just try it out on   never a bad idea to just try it out on an example you know well. That way, you an example you know well. That way, you   an example you know well. That way, you build a little intuition. In this case, build a little intuition. In this case,   build a little intuition. In this case, what's an example that you and I know what's an example that you and I know   what's an example that you and I know very well. Well, we have emphasized to very well. Well, we have emphasized to   very well. Well, we have emphasized to death the fact that if you pump in an death the fact that if you pump in an   death the fact that if you pump in an exponential function, something like e exponential function, something like e   exponential function, something like e to the a t, then its lelass transform to the a t, then its lelass transform   to the a t, then its lelass transform looks like 1 / s minus a. So let's see looks like 1 / s minus a. So let's see   looks like 1 / s minus a. So let's see what happens for this example. You know what happens for this example. You know   what happens for this example. You know how to take the derivative of an how to take the derivative of an   how to take the derivative of an exponential like this. It's delightfully exponential like this. It's delightfully   exponential like this. It's delightfully simple. You just multiply by that simple. You just multiply by that   simple. You just multiply by that constant a. And then because of constant a. And then because of   constant a. And then because of linearity, this means the applause linearity, this means the applause   linearity, this means the applause transform also just picks up that added transform also just picks up that added   transform also just picks up that added factor of a. And at first this actually factor of a. And at first this actually   factor of a. And at first this actually seems wrong. It [music] seems seems wrong. It [music] seems   seems wrong. It [music] seems inconsistent with the desired inconsistent with the desired   inconsistent with the desired conclusion. We're not multiplying by s, conclusion. We're not multiplying by s,   conclusion. We're not multiplying by s, the input of our new transformed the input of our new transformed   the input of our new transformed function. Instead, the thing we're function. Instead, the thing we're   function. Instead, the thing we're multiplying by is this random constant a multiplying by is this random constant a   multiplying by is this random constant a that characterizes what specific that characterizes what specific   that characterizes what specific exponential we happened to throw in. But exponential we happened to throw in. But   exponential we happened to throw in. But this is really just a matter of some this is really just a matter of some   this is really just a matter of some gentle algebraic massaging. Notice what gentle algebraic massaging. Notice what   gentle algebraic massaging. Notice what happens if I add this fraction s minus a happens if I add this fraction s minus a   happens if I add this fraction s minus a over s minus a, which is the same as over s minus a, which is the same as   over s minus a, which is the same as adding one. So I have to subtract off adding one. So I have to subtract off   adding one. So I have to subtract off one to account for it. When you combine one to account for it. When you combine   one to account for it. When you combine these two fractions here, you get some these two fractions here, you get some   these two fractions here, you get some nice cancellation in the numerator, nice cancellation in the numerator,   nice cancellation in the numerator, leaving behind this clean factor of s. leaving behind this clean factor of s.   leaving behind this clean factor of s. And you'll notice we're now subtracting And you'll notice we're now subtracting   And you'll notice we're now subtracting off something from the whole expression off something from the whole expression   off something from the whole expression 1. And that happens to be the initial 1. And that happens to be the initial   1. And that happens to be the initial condition. It's what you get if you plug condition. It's what you get if you plug   condition. It's what you get if you plug in tals 0 to the original function we in tals 0 to the original function we   in tals 0 to the original function we pumped in. So in fact, it really is pumped in. So in fact, it really is   pumped in. So in fact, it really is consistent with the desired conclusion. consistent with the desired conclusion.   consistent with the desired conclusion. Now, of course, this is just one very Now, of course, this is just one very   Now, of course, this is just one very specific function. This is not a general specific function. This is not a general   specific function. This is not a general explanation, but it holds within it the explanation, but it holds within it the   explanation, but it holds within it the seeds of much more generality.

Start by asking what the function e i. Start by asking what the function e   i. Start by asking what the function e to the t really is. From the perspective to the t really is. From the perspective   to the t really is. From the perspective of dynamics, this is the unique function of dynamics, this is the unique function   of dynamics, this is the unique function which is its own derivative and also which is its own derivative and also   which is its own derivative and also which equals zero when you plug in one. which equals zero when you plug in one.   which equals zero when you plug in one. For example, let's say e to the t For example, let's say e to the t   For example, let's say e to the t described a position over time. What described a position over time. What   described a position over time. What this means is that it starts at the this means is that it starts at the   this means is that it starts at the number one and at all times the velocity number one and at all times the velocity   number one and at all times the velocity has to equal the numerical value of that has to equal the numerical value of that   has to equal the numerical value of that position. So even before knowing how to position. So even before knowing how to   position. So even before knowing how to compute it or anything like that, you compute it or anything like that, you   compute it or anything like that, you get this very strong intuitive feeling get this very strong intuitive feeling   get this very strong intuitive feeling for how it behaves. It describes growth for how it behaves. It describes growth   for how it behaves. It describes growth at an everinccreasing rate. If you put at an everinccreasing rate. If you put   at an everinccreasing rate. If you put some constant in that exponent like two, some constant in that exponent like two,   some constant in that exponent like two, then by the chain rule, this means you then by the chain rule, this means you   then by the chain rule, this means you have a function whose rate of change is have a function whose rate of change is   have a function whose rate of change is exactly 2 times itself. So in the exactly 2 times itself. So in the   exactly 2 times itself. So in the language of dynamics, the velocity would language of dynamics, the velocity would   language of dynamics, the velocity would always be two times the position, always be two times the position,   always be two times the position, meaning that it grows all the more meaning that it grows all the more   meaning that it grows all the more rapidly. If the exponent was negative, rapidly. If the exponent was negative,   rapidly. If the exponent was negative, you would have something whose rate of you would have something whose rate of   you would have something whose rate of change is negative, meaning that it change is negative, meaning that it   change is negative, meaning that it shrinks over time. But the rate at which shrinks over time. But the rate at which   shrinks over time. But the rate at which it shrinks is proportional to that it shrinks is proportional to that   it shrinks is proportional to that position. So the smaller it is, the position. So the smaller it is, the   position. So the smaller it is, the smaller it shrinks, which characterizes smaller it shrinks, which characterizes   smaller it shrinks, which characterizes exponential decay. But what about exponential decay. But what about   exponential decay. But what about plugging in i, the roo&lt;unk&gt; of -1. Well, plugging in i, the roo&lt;unk&gt; of -1. Well,   plugging in i, the roo&lt;unk&gt; of -1. Well, interpreting this once more as a interpreting this once more as a   interpreting this once more as a position. This tells us that the position. This tells us that the   position. This tells us that the velocity is always I * that position. velocity is always I * that position.   velocity is always I * that position. And geometrically, multiplying by i And geometrically, multiplying by i   And geometrically, multiplying by i looks like rotating by 90°. So, if this looks like rotating by 90°. So, if this   looks like rotating by 90°. So, if this had any meaning at all, you would want had any meaning at all, you would want   had any meaning at all, you would want some kind of motion where the velocity some kind of motion where the velocity   some kind of motion where the velocity vector is always a 90° rotation of the vector is always a 90° rotation of the   vector is always a 90° rotation of the position vector. There's only one motion position vector. There's only one motion   position vector. There's only one motion that satisfies this. It's rotation in a that satisfies this. It's rotation in a   that satisfies this. It's rotation in a circle traversing a distance of 1 unit circle traversing a distance of 1 unit   circle traversing a distance of 1 unit of arc length per second. So, after pi of arc length per second. So, after pi   of arc length per second. So, after pi seconds, you would be halfway around the seconds, you would be halfway around the   seconds, you would be halfway around the circle. Meaning b to the i *&lt;unk&gt; is circle.

We set up a lot of this in the to solve. We set up a lot of this in the   to solve. We set up a lot of this in the previous chapter. And there are two previous chapter.

Number one, you need to understand Number one, you need to understand   Number one, you need to understand exponential functions. And I'm always exponential functions.

And I'm always going to be writing these as e to the s going to be writing these as e to the s   going to be writing these as e to the s * t. t represents time.

But very importantly for this topic, we're very importantly for this topic, we're   very importantly for this topic, we're going to give S the freedom to take on going to give S the freedom to take on   going to give S the freedom to take on complex number values. We covered this complex number values. We covered this   complex number values. We covered this much more thoroughly in the previous much more thoroughly in the previous   much more thoroughly in the previous chapter, but the quick summary is that chapter, but the quick summary is that   chapter, but the quick summary is that if S has an imaginary part, the output if S has an imaginary part, the output   if S has an imaginary part, the output of your function rotates in the complex of your function rotates in the complex   of your function rotates in the complex plane as time ticks forward. When the plane as time ticks forward. When the   plane as time ticks forward. When the real part of S is negative, the real part of S is negative, the   real part of S is negative, the magnitude is decaying towards zero over magnitude is decaying towards zero over   magnitude is decaying towards zero over time. But if it happened to be positive, time. But if it happened to be positive,   time. But if it happened to be positive, that would mean the magnitude grows, that would mean the magnitude grows,   that would mean the magnitude grows, namely growing exponentially. namely growing exponentially.   namely growing exponentially. If any of that feels shaky or if you If any of that feels shaky or if you   If any of that feels shaky or if you want to understand why it's true, do want to understand why it's true, do   want to understand why it's true, do watch the previous chapter. But from watch the previous chapter. But from   watch the previous chapter. But from this point forward, I'm assuming this point forward, I'm assuming   this point forward, I'm assuming everybody is comfortable with this everybody is comfortable with this   everybody is comfortable with this notion. Why do we care though? Why the notion. Why do we care though? Why the   notion. Why do we care though? Why the pub about these functions? Well, it's pub about these functions? Well, it's   pub about these functions? Well, it's because of the second thing you need to because of the second thing you need to   because of the second thing you need to know, which is that a lot of functions, know, which is that a lot of functions,   know, which is that a lot of functions, especially those arising in physics, can especially those arising in physics, can   especially those arising in physics, can be expressed as combinations of be expressed as combinations of   be expressed as combinations of exponential pieces. There's one very exponential pieces. There's one very   exponential pieces. There's one very friendly example that's going to be friendly example that's going to be   friendly example that's going to be helpful to return to repeatedly helpful to return to repeatedly   helpful to return to repeatedly throughout this lesson. The cosine of t. throughout this lesson. The cosine of t.   throughout this lesson. The cosine of t. This undulating function can be broken This undulating function can be broken   This undulating function can be broken up as a sum of two purely imaginary up as a sum of two purely imaginary   up as a sum of two purely imaginary exponentials. Basically, if you take e exponentials. Basically, if you take e   exponentials. Basically, if you take e to the i * t, that gives you rotation to the i * t, that gives you rotation   to the i * t, that gives you rotation counterclockwise, and e to the negative counterclockwise, and e to the negative   counterclockwise, and e to the negative i t rotates the other way. So, when you i t rotates the other way. So, when you   i t rotates the other way. So, when you add these two together, perhaps add these two together, perhaps   add these two together, perhaps imagining adding two rotating vectors imagining adding two rotating vectors   imagining adding two rotating vectors tiptoail, the imaginary parts cancel tiptoail, the imaginary parts cancel   tiptoail, the imaginary parts cancel each other out, and what you're left each other out, and what you're left   each other out, and what you're left with is something whose output remains with is something whose output remains   with is something whose output remains locked to the real number line, locked to the real number line,   locked to the real number line, oscillating back and forth. Now, as it oscillating back and forth. Now, as it   oscillating back and forth. Now, as it stands, this sum goes between -2 and stands, this sum goes between -2 and   stands, this sum goes between -2 and pos2, but a cosine only goes between -1 pos2, but a cosine only goes between -1   pos2, but a cosine only goes between -1 and 1. So, finally, you multiply and 1. So, finally, you multiply   and 1. So, finally, you multiply everything by 1/2. everything by 1/2.   everything by 1/2. More complicated functions might break More complicated functions might break   More complicated functions might break down into more exponential pieces. For down into more exponential pieces. For   down into more exponential pieces. For example, later in this lesson, you and I example, later in this lesson, you and I   example, later in this lesson, you and I are going to dig into something called are going to dig into something called   are going to dig into something called the driven harmonic oscillator, which is the driven harmonic oscillator, which is   the driven harmonic oscillator, which is basically a mass on a spring that's basically a mass on a spring that's   basically a mass on a spring that's influenced by some external force. In influenced by some external force. In   influenced by some external force. In our case, one that oscillates over time. our case, one that oscillates over time.   our case, one that oscillates over time. As a spoiler, the solution to the As a spoiler, the solution to the   As a spoiler, the solution to the equation describing that ends up looking equation describing that ends up looking   equation describing that ends up looking like a sum of four exponential pieces. like a sum of four exponential pieces.   like a sum of four exponential pieces. Two of those pieces oscillate and decay Two of those pieces oscillate and decay   Two of those pieces oscillate and decay in a way that matches the natural in a way that matches the natural   in a way that matches the natural resonant frequency of the spring and resonant frequency of the spring and   resonant frequency of the spring and then the other two oscillate in a way then the other two oscillate in a way   then the other two oscillate in a way that matches the external force. So for that matches the external force. So for   that matches the external force. So for cases like this and many others, what we cases like this and many others, what we   cases like this and many others, what we would like is some sort of tool, some would like is some sort of tool, some   would like is some sort of tool, some sort of mathematical machine where you sort of mathematical machine where you   sort of mathematical machine where you can pump in a function or even a can pump in a function or even a   can pump in a function or even a differential equation describing that differential equation describing that   differential equation describing that function and that machine will somehow function and that machine will somehow   function and that machine will somehow reveal for us what specific exponential reveal for us what specific exponential   reveal for us what specific exponential pieces that function breaks down into. pieces that function breaks down into.   pieces that function breaks down into. That is, it exposes what these values s That is, it exposes what these values s   That is, it exposes what these values s in the exponent all are, as well as what in the exponent all are, as well as what   in the exponent all are, as well as what the corresponding coefficients are. Now the corresponding coefficients are. Now   the corresponding coefficients are. Now you might be wondering why exponential you might be wondering why exponential   you might be wondering why exponential pieces, why not focus on something else? pieces, why not focus on something else?   pieces, why not focus on something else? The short answer is that for these The short answer is that for these   The short answer is that for these functions, when you take a derivative, functions, when you take a derivative,   functions, when you take a derivative, it looks precisely the same as it looks precisely the same as   it looks precisely the same as multiplying by some number, namely s. multiplying by some number, namely s.   multiplying by some number, namely s. What you'll see by the end is how this What you'll see by the end is how this   What you'll see by the end is how this means that same machine that lets us means that same machine that lets us   means that same machine that lets us dissect functions into exponential dissect functions into exponential   dissect functions into exponential pieces also allows us to turn pieces also allows us to turn   pieces also allows us to turn differential equations into algebra. differential equations into algebra.   differential equations into algebra. Essentially, because everywhere you see Essentially, because everywhere you see   Essentially, because everywhere you see a derivative, it turns into a derivative, it turns into   a derivative, it turns into multiplication by s. multiplication by s.   multiplication by s. Now in a context like this one where we Now in a context like this one where we   Now in a context like this one where we are so focused on complex valued are so focused on complex valued   are so focused on complex valued exponentials engineers have a special exponentials engineers have a special   exponentials engineers have a special name for this complex plane that I'm name for this complex plane that I'm   name for this complex plane that I'm depicting on the left representing all depicting on the left representing all   depicting on the left representing all possible values for that term s in the possible values for that term s in the   possible values for that term s in the exponent. They call it well the s plane. exponent. They call it well the s plane.   exponent. They call it well the s plane. A helpful mental image is to think of A helpful mental image is to think of   A helpful mental image is to think of each individual point on the s plane as each individual point on the s plane as   each individual point on the s plane as encoding the entire exponential function encoding the entire exponential function   encoding the entire exponential function e to the s * t. For this picture, the e to the s * t. For this picture, the   e to the s * t. For this picture, the graphs I'm showing only depict the real graphs I'm showing only depict the real   graphs I'm showing only depict the real component of the output. But keep in component of the output. But keep in   component of the output.

I think it's helpful to quickly preview what this new function actually preview what this new function actually   preview what this new function actually does before we pull up the definition does before we pull up the definition   does before we pull up the definition and start dissecting it. Suppose your and start dissecting it. Suppose your   and start dissecting it. Suppose your original function little f of t really original function little f of t really   original function little f of t really can be broken down as a sum of several can be broken down as a sum of several   can be broken down as a sum of several exponential pieces. When you apply this exponential pieces. When you apply this   exponential pieces. When you apply this lelass transform giving you a new lelass transform giving you a new   lelass transform giving you a new function of this new variable s. If you function of this new variable s. If you   function of this new variable s. If you were to plot this new function over the were to plot this new function over the   were to plot this new function over the s plane in a way that I will explain in s plane in a way that I will explain in   s plane in a way that I will explain in just a minute. What you see are these just a minute. What you see are these   just a minute. What you see are these sharp spikes above each value of s that sharp spikes above each value of s that   sharp spikes above each value of s that corresponds to one of those exponential corresponds to one of those exponential   corresponds to one of those exponential pieces. These spikes have a fancy name. pieces. These spikes have a fancy name.   pieces. These spikes have a fancy name. They are called the poles of your They are called the poles of your   They are called the poles of your function. So even if you didn't know function. So even if you didn't know   function. So even if you didn't know ahead of time how your function could be ahead of time how your function could be   ahead of time how your function could be broken down as a sum of exponentials, if broken down as a sum of exponentials, if   broken down as a sum of exponentials, if you understand this transformed version you understand this transformed version   you understand this transformed version and specifically if you understand the and specifically if you understand the   and specifically if you understand the poles, that can reveal for you what poles, that can reveal for you what   poles, that can reveal for you what those exponential pieces are. At this those exponential pieces are. At this   those exponential pieces are. At this point, you're probably itching to see point, you're probably itching to see   point, you're probably itching to see how this thing is actually defined. And how this thing is actually defined. And   how this thing is actually defined. And in its full glory, this is what that in its full glory, this is what that   in its full glory, this is what that definition looks like, which we can definition looks like, which we can   definition looks like, which we can think of as two separate steps. First, think of as two separate steps. First,   think of as two separate steps. First, you multiply your function by the you multiply your function by the   you multiply your function by the expression e to the s t. And then expression e to the s t. And then   expression e to the s t. And then second, you integrate that result over second, you integrate that result over   second, you integrate that result over time from t=0 to infinity. We'll talk time from t=0 to infinity. We'll talk   time from t=0 to infinity. We'll talk all about that integral and its nuances all about that integral and its nuances   all about that integral and its nuances in just a minute, but for the moment, in just a minute, but for the moment,   in just a minute, but for the moment, focus on that inner expression. This focus on that inner expression. This   focus on that inner expression. This term s is the newly introduced term s is the newly introduced   term s is the newly introduced parameter, the one that is the input of parameter, the one that is the input of   parameter, the one that is the input of our new transformed function. As I said, our new transformed function. As I said,   our new transformed function. As I said, it's a complex number. Every time you it's a complex number. Every time you   it's a complex number. Every time you see the letter s in this video, it's a see the letter s in this video, it's a   see the letter s in this video, it's a complex number. And the way I like to complex number. And the way I like to   complex number. And the way I like to think about it is that you might imagine think about it is that you might imagine   think about it is that you might imagine freely moving around this value s on the freely moving around this value s on the   freely moving around this value s on the s plane and it's kind of sniffing around s plane and it's kind of sniffing around   s plane and it's kind of sniffing around to find which specific exponential to find which specific exponential   to find which specific exponential functions line up closely with our functions line up closely with our   functions line up closely with our function little f of t. For example, function little f of t. For example,   function little f of t. For example, let's suppose our function is the cosine let's suppose our function is the cosine   let's suppose our function is the cosine of t, which as we discussed just a of t, which as we discussed just a   of t, which as we discussed just a minute ago, we already know can be minute ago, we already know can be   minute ago, we already know can be broken down as a sum of two broken down as a sum of two   broken down as a sum of two exponentials, e to the i it t and e to exponentials, e to the i it t and e to   exponentials, e to the i it t and e to the negative i t. I've already previewed the negative i t. I've already previewed   the negative i t. I've already previewed the idea that when you plot the final the idea that when you plot the final   the idea that when you plot the final result, you should see these spikes over result, you should see these spikes over   result, you should see these spikes over the key values of S, which in this the key values of S, which in this   the key values of S, which in this example would mean poles above plus I example would mean poles above plus I   example would mean poles above plus I and negative I. And you can already get and negative I. And you can already get   and negative I. And you can already get a little intuition by taking this a little intuition by taking this   a little intuition by taking this example and substituting in the expanded example and substituting in the expanded   example and substituting in the expanded expression for the cosine of t. Looking expression for the cosine of t. Looking   expression for the cosine of t. Looking at this expansion, I want you to take a at this expansion, I want you to take a   at this expansion, I want you to take a moment to think about the product of moment to think about the product of   moment to think about the product of these two terms. When you multiply two these two terms. When you multiply two   these two terms. When you multiply two exponentials, the contents of those exponentials, the contents of those   exponentials, the contents of those exponents add together. So, what you're exponents add together. So, what you're   exponents add together. So, what you're left with is e raised to the i minus s * left with is e raised to the i minus s *   left with is e raised to the i minus s * t. Let me go ahead and plot that value t. Let me go ahead and plot that value   t. Let me go ahead and plot that value on the lower right, keeping the s plane on the lower right, keeping the s plane   on the lower right, keeping the s plane on the upper right. Just like the on the upper right. Just like the   on the upper right. Just like the exponentials we've already seen, as time exponentials we've already seen, as time   exponentials we've already seen, as time goes from 0 to infinity, this oscillates goes from 0 to infinity, this oscillates   goes from 0 to infinity, this oscillates and decays, or maybe it grows. The and decays, or maybe it grows. The   and decays, or maybe it grows. The specific shape depends on how we set specific shape depends on how we set   specific shape depends on how we set that value s. Now in this case as you that value s. Now in this case as you   that value s. Now in this case as you move around that value s there is one move around that value s there is one   move around that value s there is one specific value causing uniquely boring specific value causing uniquely boring   specific value causing uniquely boring behavior. If you set s equal to i then behavior. If you set s equal to i then   behavior. If you set s equal to i then that term in the exponent becomes zero. that term in the exponent becomes zero.   that term in the exponent becomes zero. So the entire function just looks like e So the entire function just looks like e   So the entire function just looks like e to the zero which is stuck at the to the zero which is stuck at the   to the zero which is stuck at the constant 1. And this is a key idea for constant 1. And this is a key idea for   constant 1. And this is a key idea for almost all values of s. An exponential almost all values of s. An exponential   almost all values of s. An exponential like this is going to change with time like this is going to change with time   like this is going to change with time typically looking like some kind of typically looking like some kind of   typically looking like some kind of spiral but at the special value that spiral but at the special value that   spiral but at the special value that we're hunting for. In this case, S we're hunting for. In this case, S   we're hunting for. In this case, S equals I. Instead, things get stuck at a equals I. Instead, things get stuck at a   equals I. Instead, things get stuck at a constant. constant.   constant. So, stepping back, if you were a So, stepping back, if you were a   So, stepping back, if you were a mathematician and you're trying to mathematician and you're trying to   mathematician and you're trying to invent some kind of machine that will invent some kind of machine that will   invent some kind of machine that will detect the exponential pieces lurking detect the exponential pieces lurking   detect the exponential pieces lurking inside a function, for example, inside a function, for example,   inside a function, for example, detecting that a cosine has an e to the detecting that a cosine has an e to the   detecting that a cosine has an e to the it and an e to the negative it lurking it and an e to the negative it lurking   it and an e to the negative it lurking inside it. You might ask yourself, is inside it. You might ask yourself, is   inside it. You might ask yourself, is there something I can do that can detect there something I can do that can detect   there something I can do that can detect when one of the terms in a sum like this when one of the terms in a sum like this   when one of the terms in a sum like this is secretly just a constant? In essence, is secretly just a constant? In essence,   is secretly just a constant? In essence, this is the role played by the integral this is the role played by the integral   this is the role played by the integral that is wrapping everything up in the that is wrapping everything up in the   that is wrapping everything up in the full definition, integrating as time full definition, integrating as time   full definition, integrating as time goes from 0 to infinity. And on the one goes from 0 to infinity. And on the one   goes from 0 to infinity. And on the one hand, if you're comfortable with hand, if you're comfortable with   hand, if you're comfortable with calculus, you might be able to calculus, you might be able to   calculus, you might be able to anticipate why this would result in some anticipate why this would result in some   anticipate why this would result in some kind of sharp spike over the desired kind of sharp spike over the desired   kind of sharp spike over the desired values of s. If you integrate a constant values of s. If you integrate a constant   values of s. If you integrate a constant from zero all the way up to infinity, it from zero all the way up to infinity, it   from zero all the way up to infinity, it blows up. But there's actually a fair blows up. But there's actually a fair   blows up. But there's actually a fair bit of nuance here. To start, that bit of nuance here. To start, that   bit of nuance here. To start, that function inside the integral takes on function inside the integral takes on   function inside the integral takes on complex number values. And this raises a complex number values. And this raises a   complex number values. And this raises a natural question for those of us curious natural question for those of us curious   natural question for those of us curious to interpret things in a satisfying way. to interpret things in a satisfying way.   to interpret things in a satisfying way. How do you think about integrating a How do you think about integrating a   How do you think about integrating a complex valued function? If you're up complex valued function? If you're up   complex valued function? If you're up for it, what I'd like to do with the for it, what I'd like to do with the   for it, what I'd like to do with the next 10 minutes or so is really dig in next 10 minutes or so is really dig in   next 10 minutes or so is really dig in and dissect what an integral like this and dissect what an integral like this   and dissect what an integral like this really means, how to visualize it, and really means, how to visualize it, and   really means, how to visualize it, and to explain why the plots that I'm to explain why the plots that I'm   to explain why the plots that I'm showing represent something slightly showing represent something slightly   showing represent something slightly distinct from the literal meaning of distinct from the literal meaning of   distinct from the literal meaning of this integral. As with any new piece of this integral. As with any new piece of   this integral. As with any new piece of math, it's best to start easy and work math, it's best to start easy and work   math, it's best to start easy and work our way up in complexity. So to kick our way up in complexity. So to kick   our way up in complexity. So to kick things off, let's just ignore this things off, let's just ignore this   things off, let's just ignore this function f of t itself and only focus on function f of t itself and only focus on   function f of t itself and only focus on integrating the e to the s t part. And integrating the e to the s t part. And   integrating the e to the s t part. And to warm up, before jumping into the to warm up, before jumping into the   to warm up, before jumping into the complexity of it all, let's just suppose complexity of it all, let's just suppose   complexity of it all, let's just suppose that s is a real number. Meaning this is that s is a real number. Meaning this is   that s is a real number. Meaning this is a friendly real valued function that we a friendly real valued function that we   a friendly real valued function that we can plot with a graph like normal. can plot with a graph like normal.   can plot with a graph like normal. Typically, when you first learn Typically, when you first learn   Typically, when you first learn calculus, you learn to interpret an calculus, you learn to interpret an   calculus, you learn to interpret an integral as telling you the area under a integral as telling you the area under a   integral as telling you the area under a graph like this. For example, if you set graph like this. For example, if you set   graph like this. For example, if you set the value s equal to 1 and you go the value s equal to 1 and you go   the value s equal to 1 and you go through the procedure for actually through the procedure for actually   through the procedure for actually calculating this integral, you know, you calculating this integral, you know, you   calculating this integral, you know, you take an anti-derivative, you take the take an anti-derivative, you take the   take an anti-derivative, you take the difference at the two different bounds, difference at the two different bounds,   difference at the two different bounds, or because there's an infinity, you or because there's an infinity, you   or because there's an infinity, you could say you take the limiting value at could say you take the limiting value at   could say you take the limiting value at that bound. The way it all works out is that bound. The way it all works out is   that bound. The way it all works out is that this expression equals 1. And you that this expression equals 1. And you   that this expression equals 1. And you can interpret that as telling you that can interpret that as telling you that   can interpret that as telling you that the area under this graph is 1, which is the area under this graph is 1, which is   the area under this graph is 1, which is kind of fun. I guess that means that all kind of fun. I guess that means that all   kind of fun. I guess that means that all the area under this infinite tail is the area under this infinite tail is   the area under this infinite tail is exactly enough to fill in the rest of exactly enough to fill in the rest of   exactly enough to fill in the rest of this unit square. And then if we this unit square. And then if we   this unit square. And then if we reintroduce that value s and set it reintroduce that value s and set it   reintroduce that value s and set it equal to something that's not one, the equal to something that's not one, the   equal to something that's not one, the effect is to squish the graph in the effect is to squish the graph in the   effect is to squish the graph in the horizontal direction. That's always the horizontal direction. That's always the   horizontal direction. That's always the effect if you multiply the input of a effect if you multiply the input of a   effect if you multiply the input of a function by some constant. And so the function by some constant. And so the   function by some constant. And so the area under this graph, which started out area under this graph, which started out   area under this graph, which started out as 1, must now be 1 / s. The key thing I as 1, must now be 1 / s. The key thing I   as 1, must now be 1 / s. The key thing I want you to remember here is how if we want you to remember here is how if we   want you to remember here is how if we let s get smaller and smaller and let s get smaller and smaller and   let s get smaller and smaller and approach the value at zero then that approach the value at zero then that   approach the value at zero then that area gets bigger and bigger and bigger area gets bigger and bigger and bigger   area gets bigger and bigger and bigger actually approaching infinity and actually approaching infinity and   actually approaching infinity and approaching it quite quickly too. But approaching it quite quickly too. But   approaching it quite quickly too. But graphs are not the only way to visualize graphs are not the only way to visualize   graphs are not the only way to visualize functions and area is not the only way functions and area is not the only way   functions and area is not the only way to understand integrals and you should to understand integrals and you should   to understand integrals and you should get in the habit of flexing your mind a get in the habit of flexing your mind a   get in the habit of flexing your mind a little bit more. Let me show you another little bit more. Let me show you another   little bit more. Let me show you another way to think about this that will way to think about this that will   way to think about this that will generalize more easily once we let that generalize more easily once we let that   generalize more easily once we let that function take on complex number values. function take on complex number values.   function take on complex number values. Think about this integral just between 0 Think about this integral just between 0   Think about this integral just between 0 and 1, something with a unit length. And and 1, something with a unit length. And   and 1, something with a unit length. And I want you to imagine all this area I want you to imagine all this area   I want you to imagine all this area under the graph as a pool of water which under the graph as a pool of water which   under the graph as a pool of water which you let kind of slush down until it you let kind of slush down until it   you let kind of slush down until it becomes level. The height of this pool becomes level. The height of this pool   becomes level. The height of this pool is telling you the average value of that is telling you the average value of that   is telling you the average value of that function between 0 and 1. And then function between 0 and 1. And then   function between 0 and 1. And then because the width of this pool is just because the width of this pool is just   because the width of this pool is just 1, then its area is the same thing as 1, then its area is the same thing as   1, then its area is the same thing as its height. So this integral up top when its height. So this integral up top when   its height. So this integral up top when it's over a unit interval is telling you it's over a unit interval is telling you   it's over a unit interval is telling you the average value of the function on the average value of the function on   the average value of the function on that interval. Similarly, the integral that interval. Similarly, the integral   that interval. Similarly, the integral from 1 to 2 would be telling you the from 1 to 2 would be telling you the   from 1 to 2 would be telling you the average value the function takes over average value the function takes over   average value the function takes over that interval from 1 to 2. And then same that interval from 1 to 2. And then same   that interval from 1 to 2. And then same deal as you keep integrating along a deal as you keep integrating along a   deal as you keep integrating along a bunch of other unit intervals. So then bunch of other unit intervals. So then   bunch of other unit intervals. So then if you want the integral from zero out if you want the integral from zero out   if you want the integral from zero out to infinity, what you can think about is to infinity, what you can think about is   to infinity, what you can think about is taking all of these average values on taking all of these average values on   taking all of these average values on those intervals and adding them all those intervals and adding them all   those intervals and adding them all together. This is something we can work together. This is something we can work   together. This is something we can work with. Now let's look at the complex with. Now let's look at the complex   with. Now let's look at the complex case. S is going to be some complex case. S is going to be some complex   case. S is going to be some complex number. And then the function e to the s number. And then the function e to the s   number. And then the function e to the s t cycles and decays around the complex t cycles and decays around the complex   t cycles and decays around the complex plane as you let time go from zero up to plane as you let time go from zero up to   plane as you let time go from zero up to infinity. The specific way that it infinity. The specific way that it   infinity. The specific way that it cycles and decays or grows depends on cycles and decays or grows depends on   cycles and decays or grows depends on that value of s and we'll get a distinct that value of s and we'll get a distinct   that value of s and we'll get a distinct path through the complex plane for each path through the complex plane for each   path through the complex plane for each one. Now, if you want to integrate this one. Now, if you want to integrate this   one. Now, if you want to integrate this function on a unit interval, let's say function on a unit interval, let's say   function on a unit interval, let's say from the values t= 0 to t = 1, imagine from the values t= 0 to t = 1, imagine   from the values t= 0 to t = 1, imagine taking a sample of all of the outputs in taking a sample of all of the outputs in   taking a sample of all of the outputs in this range and then finding the average, this range and then finding the average,   this range and then finding the average, the center of mass for all those points. the center of mass for all those points.   the center of mass for all those points. That average value is the meaning of That average value is the meaning of   That average value is the meaning of this integral, which I will represent this integral, which I will represent   this integral, which I will represent with a little arrow. And actually, it'll with a little arrow. And actually, it'll   with a little arrow. And actually, it'll be helpful if we put this integral in be helpful if we put this integral in   be helpful if we put this integral in its own complex plane down in the lower its own complex plane down in the lower   its own complex plane down in the lower right because we're about to start right because we're about to start   right because we're about to start adding them all up. If you let t range adding them all up. If you let t range   adding them all up. If you let t range from one up to two, and you do the same from one up to two, and you do the same   from one up to two, and you do the same thing. Take the average value on that thing. Take the average value on that   thing. Take the average value on that interval, represent it with an arrow, interval, represent it with an arrow,   interval, represent it with an arrow, and then you add that arrow to what we and then you add that arrow to what we   and then you add that arrow to what we have on the lower right, the resulting have on the lower right, the resulting   have on the lower right, the resulting sum is basically telling you the sum is basically telling you the   sum is basically telling you the integral from 0 all the way up to two. integral from 0 all the way up to two.   integral from 0 all the way up to two. And then we repeat. You take an average And then we repeat. You take an average   And then we repeat. You take an average between two and three, add that average between two and three, add that average   between two and three, add that average between three and four, add that, and between three and four, add that, and   between three and four, add that, and just keep going on and on and on and on. just keep going on and on and on and on.   just keep going on and on and on and on. And the limiting point for this And the limiting point for this   And the limiting point for this spiraling sum that you see is the value spiraling sum that you see is the value   spiraling sum that you see is the value of the integral from 0 to infinity of e of the integral from 0 to infinity of e   of the integral from 0 to infinity of e to the s. Exactly the expression we're to the s. Exactly the expression we're   to the s. Exactly the expression we're trying to understand. And as we move trying to understand. And as we move   trying to understand. And as we move around that input s, the resulting value around that input s, the resulting value   around that input s, the resulting value of this spiraling sum might wander of this spiraling sum might wander   of this spiraling sum might wander around the complex plane. As a quick around the complex plane. As a quick   around the complex plane. As a quick sanity check, let me move that value of sanity check, let me move that value of   sanity check, let me move that value of s over to the input one. So there's no s over to the input one. So there's no   s over to the input one. So there's no oscillation cuz there's no imaginary oscillation cuz there's no imaginary   oscillation cuz there's no imaginary part. And you'll notice that all these part. And you'll notice that all these   part. And you'll notice that all these little arrows stack up to end up on the little arrows stack up to end up on the   little arrows stack up to end up on the number 1. And this should make sense. number 1. And this should make sense.   number 1. And this should make sense. Back when we were interpreting the Back when we were interpreting the   Back when we were interpreting the integral the more familiar way as an integral the more familiar way as an   integral the more familiar way as an area under a curve, we saw that this area under a curve, we saw that this   area under a curve, we saw that this value when s= 1 works out to be 1. And value when s= 1 works out to be 1. And   value when s= 1 works out to be 1. And just as before, if I let s approach just as before, if I let s approach   just as before, if I let s approach zero, getting smaller and smaller, then zero, getting smaller and smaller, then   zero, getting smaller and smaller, then the resulting integral gets bigger and the resulting integral gets bigger and   the resulting integral gets bigger and bigger, rapidly approaching infinity. In bigger, rapidly approaching infinity. In   bigger, rapidly approaching infinity. In this new diagram, we can see how if s this new diagram, we can see how if s   this new diagram, we can see how if s moves away from zero in a different moves away from zero in a different   moves away from zero in a different direction, moving vertically, the direction, moving vertically, the   direction, moving vertically, the resulting integral also gets smaller, resulting integral also gets smaller,   resulting integral also gets smaller, but for a much different reason. All the but for a much different reason. All the   but for a much different reason. All the oscillation in the function gives us oscillation in the function gives us   oscillation in the function gives us more cancellation in that vector sum. So more cancellation in that vector sum. So   more cancellation in that vector sum. So the output gets closer to zero. Next, the output gets closer to zero. Next,   the output gets closer to zero. Next, what I want to do is plot this value. what I want to do is plot this value.   what I want to do is plot this value. So, look at that point where our So, look at that point where our   So, look at that point where our spiraling sum converges to. I want you spiraling sum converges to. I want you   spiraling sum converges to. I want you to think of it as a little vector in the to think of it as a little vector in the   to think of it as a little vector in the complex plane, something that has a complex plane, something that has a   complex plane, something that has a magnitude and a direction. And to get a magnitude and a direction. And to get a   magnitude and a direction. And to get a little fancy, let's take that magnitude little fancy, let's take that magnitude   little fancy, let's take that magnitude and we're going to plot it above the and we're going to plot it above the   and we're going to plot it above the value s in the s plane. So, as I change value s in the s plane. So, as I change   value s in the s plane. So, as I change that value s and it changes the that value s and it changes the   that value s and it changes the resulting integral, the magnitude of our resulting integral, the magnitude of our   resulting integral, the magnitude of our output might grow or shrink. And as it output might grow or shrink. And as it   output might grow or shrink. And as it does so, we will plot the result over does so, we will plot the result over   does so, we will plot the result over the S plane. And I'm just going to leave the S plane. And I'm just going to leave   the S plane. And I'm just going to leave this on autopilot for a moment where S this on autopilot for a moment where S   this on autopilot for a moment where S is going to wander around the plane. And is going to wander around the plane. And   is going to wander around the plane. And as it does so, take a moment to think as it does so, take a moment to think   as it does so, take a moment to think about why we're getting the shapes that about why we're getting the shapes that   about why we're getting the shapes that we see. we see.   we see. Basically, the bigger the imaginary part Basically, the bigger the imaginary part   Basically, the bigger the imaginary part of S, the more spiraling there is in the of S, the more spiraling there is in the   of S, the more spiraling there is in the expression, meaning more cancellation. expression, meaning more cancellation.   expression, meaning more cancellation. So, the magnitude of that output is So, the magnitude of that output is   So, the magnitude of that output is smaller. Here's what it looks like if I smaller. Here's what it looks like if I   smaller. Here's what it looks like if I graph the full plot over many possible graph the full plot over many possible   graph the full plot over many possible values of S. The most obvious feature is values of S. The most obvious feature is   values of S. The most obvious feature is how if S gets closer and closer to zero, how if S gets closer and closer to zero,   how if S gets closer and closer to zero, then the magnitude of that output gets then the magnitude of that output gets   then the magnitude of that output gets bigger and bigger, which makes sense. bigger and bigger, which makes sense.   bigger and bigger, which makes sense. The small real part means it has slower The small real part means it has slower   The small real part means it has slower decay, and the small imaginary part decay, and the small imaginary part   decay, and the small imaginary part means there's less cancellation. means there's less cancellation.   means there's less cancellation. Now, as it stands, I'm only graphing the Now, as it stands, I'm only graphing the   Now, as it stands, I'm only graphing the magnitude of that output. But of course, magnitude of that output. But of course,   magnitude of that output. But of course, it has more information than that. It it has more information than that. It   it has more information than that. It has a direction, too. So if we associate has a direction, too. So if we associate   has a direction, too. So if we associate every possible direction of that output every possible direction of that output   every possible direction of that output with a unique color, then one thing I with a unique color, then one thing I   with a unique color, then one thing I could do is color the graph, giving us a could do is color the graph, giving us a   could do is color the graph, giving us a richer sense of what that output looks richer sense of what that output looks   richer sense of what that output looks like. The other thing you've probably like. The other thing you've probably   like. The other thing you've probably already noticed about this plot is that already noticed about this plot is that   already noticed about this plot is that it is conspicuously not being drawn over it is conspicuously not being drawn over   it is conspicuously not being drawn over values of S where the real part is values of S where the real part is   values of S where the real part is negative. And think about what those negative. And think about what those   negative. And think about what those values actually mean. When the real part values actually mean. When the real part   values actually mean. When the real part of S is negative, then the function e to of S is negative, then the function e to   of S is negative, then the function e to the ST grows exponentially. And this the ST grows exponentially. And this   the ST grows exponentially. And this spiraling sum for the integral we have spiraling sum for the integral we have   spiraling sum for the integral we have blows up. It does not converge. So these blows up. It does not converge. So these   blows up. It does not converge. So these values are not defined. At least for the values are not defined. At least for the   values are not defined. At least for the moment, they're not defined. There's a moment, they're not defined. There's a   moment, they're not defined. There's a fancy notion we'll get to shortly. On fancy notion we'll get to shortly. On   fancy notion we'll get to shortly. On the boundary, things get kind of the boundary, things get kind of   the boundary, things get kind of interesting. If S is purely imaginary, interesting. If S is purely imaginary,   interesting. If S is purely imaginary, the value e^ the value e^   the value e^ simply goes around in a circle, purely simply goes around in a circle, purely   simply goes around in a circle, purely rotating, neither growing nor decaying. rotating, neither growing nor decaying.   rotating, neither growing nor decaying. And as we play this game of averaging And as we play this game of averaging   And as we play this game of averaging along various intervals and adding them along various intervals and adding them   along various intervals and adding them together, that vector sum we get in the together, that vector sum we get in the   together, that vector sum we get in the lower right simply spirals around and lower right simply spirals around and   lower right simply spirals around and around adnauseium. Now, on the one hand, around adnauseium. Now, on the one hand,   around adnauseium. Now, on the one hand, this also does not converge. There's not this also does not converge. There's not   this also does not converge. There's not a specific value that this approaches. a specific value that this approaches.   a specific value that this approaches. However, it's not too hard to make sense However, it's not too hard to make sense   However, it's not too hard to make sense out of it. If you let the value of s get out of it. If you let the value of s get   out of it. If you let the value of s get even just a little bit of a real even just a little bit of a real   even just a little bit of a real component, then our function does decay component, then our function does decay   component, then our function does decay and our spiraling sum does approach a and our spiraling sum does approach a   and our spiraling sum does approach a clear concrete value. And then if you clear concrete value. And then if you   clear concrete value. And then if you slowly take away that real part of S, slowly take away that real part of S,   slowly take away that real part of S, letting it approach the imaginary number letting it approach the imaginary number   letting it approach the imaginary number line, then that resulting integral on line, then that resulting integral on   line, then that resulting integral on the lower right unambiguously approaches the lower right unambiguously approaches   the lower right unambiguously approaches one clear value. And you can see that on one clear value. And you can see that on   one clear value. And you can see that on the plot, too. There's clearly some the plot, too. There's clearly some   the plot, too. There's clearly some value that it wants to take on. value that it wants to take on.   value that it wants to take on. And in fact, I can tell you precisely And in fact, I can tell you precisely   And in fact, I can tell you precisely what value it wants to converge to. what value it wants to converge to.   what value it wants to converge to. Think back to the real valued case where Think back to the real valued case where   Think back to the real valued case where we saw that the integral is equal to 1 / we saw that the integral is equal to 1 /   we saw that the integral is equal to 1 / s. This is a purely analytic fact that s. This is a purely analytic fact that   s. This is a purely analytic fact that remains true even when S is a complex remains true even when S is a complex   remains true even when S is a complex number. Maybe that's what you'd expect, number. Maybe that's what you'd expect,   number. Maybe that's what you'd expect, but it's not at all obvious that this but it's not at all obvious that this   but it's not at all obvious that this should remain true in the more rich case should remain true in the more rich case   should remain true in the more rich case of complex numbers. To gut check, for at of complex numbers. To gut check, for at   of complex numbers. To gut check, for at least one example, we were just looking least one example, we were just looking   least one example, we were just looking very closely at what happens while S very closely at what happens while S   very closely at what happens while S approaches the imaginary constant I. And approaches the imaginary constant I. And   approaches the imaginary constant I. And if you focus on what's happening in the if you focus on what's happening in the   if you focus on what's happening in the lower right, you'll see that the lower right, you'll see that the   lower right, you'll see that the integral is approaching I. And indeed 1 integral is approaching I. And indeed 1   integral is approaching I. And indeed 1 / i is negative i. So we have this nice / i is negative i. So we have this nice   / i is negative i. So we have this nice and blessedly simple equation describing and blessedly simple equation describing   and blessedly simple equation describing our integral. But the funny thing about our integral. But the funny thing about   our integral. But the funny thing about it is that this right hand side 1 / s is it is that this right hand side 1 / s is   it is that this right hand side 1 / s is defined everywhere on the plane. I can defined everywhere on the plane. I can   defined everywhere on the plane. I can plot the result. This is what it looks plot the result. This is what it looks   plot the result. This is what it looks like. Now maybe you raise an eyebrow for like. Now maybe you raise an eyebrow for   like. Now maybe you raise an eyebrow for s equals 0. But almost everywhere this s equals 0. But almost everywhere this   s equals 0. But almost everywhere this has an unambiguous value. Now to be has an unambiguous value. Now to be   has an unambiguous value. Now to be clear the integral itself emphatically clear the integral itself emphatically   clear the integral itself emphatically does not converge on the left half of does not converge on the left half of   does not converge on the left half of the plane. So in that region, the the plane. So in that region, the   the plane. So in that region, the equation strictly speaking makes no equation strictly speaking makes no   equation strictly speaking makes no sense. As an example, think about sense. As an example, think about   sense. As an example, think about setting s equal to -1. On the right hand setting s equal to -1. On the right hand   setting s equal to -1. On the right hand side, 1 /1 is -1. But I think you'll side, 1 /1 is -1. But I think you'll   side, 1 /1 is -1. But I think you'll agree that integrating e to the t from 0 agree that integrating e to the t from 0   agree that integrating e to the t from 0 to infinity sure does not look like -1. to infinity sure does not look like -1.   to infinity sure does not look like -1.

However, it can be very helpful to plot and to understand very helpful to plot and to understand   very helpful to plot and to understand the full extended version exposing all the full extended version exposing all   the full extended version exposing all the poles of the function. As I alluded the poles of the function. As I alluded   the poles of the function. As I alluded to earlier, the poles are what exposes to earlier, the poles are what exposes   to earlier, the poles are what exposes the exponential pieces that we're the exponential pieces that we're   the exponential pieces that we're hunting for. Looking back at this hunting for. Looking back at this   hunting for. Looking back at this warm-up example that we've been focusing warm-up example that we've been focusing   warm-up example that we've been focusing on, the integral of e to the s. As I on, the integral of e to the s. As I   on, the integral of e to the s. As I said, that only converges when the real said, that only converges when the real   said, that only converges when the real part of s is positive. And on that half part of s is positive. And on that half   part of s is positive. And on that half plane, it equals 1 / s. 1 / s is defined plane, it equals 1 / s. 1 / s is defined   plane, it equals 1 / s. 1 / s is defined everywhere and it is nice in the sense everywhere and it is nice in the sense   everywhere and it is nice in the sense of having a derivative.

That might seem as a pole above s= 0. That might seem   as a pole above s= 0. That might seem like a simple example, but almost for like a simple example, but almost for   like a simple example, but almost for free, we can squeeze out a much more free, we can squeeze out a much more   free, we can squeeze out a much more general result, which is that the general result, which is that the   general result, which is that the transform of any exponential function transform of any exponential function   transform of any exponential function also looks like a simple pole.

What would happen if I asked you to pump in a happen if I asked you to pump in a   happen if I asked you to pump in a function like, I don't know, e to the function like, I don't know, e to the   function like, I don't know, e to the 1.5 * t? Well, then the expression 1.5 * t? Well, then the expression   1.5 * t? Well, then the expression inside that integral combines and you inside that integral combines and you   inside that integral combines and you get e to the 1.5 - s * t, which is get e to the 1.5 - s * t, which is   get e to the 1.5 - s * t, which is nearly identical to everything we were nearly identical to everything we were   nearly identical to everything we were just looking at. It's just things are just looking at. It's just things are   just looking at. It's just things are shifted by 1.5. If you wanted, I could shifted by 1.5. If you wanted, I could   shifted by 1.5. If you wanted, I could pull up that same visual, which dissects pull up that same visual, which dissects   pull up that same visual, which dissects and interprets the integral pictured on and interprets the integral pictured on   and interprets the integral pictured on the lower right. And again, the function the lower right. And again, the function   the lower right. And again, the function inside the integral is pictured on the inside the integral is pictured on the   inside the integral is pictured on the upper right. And we're playing the same upper right. And we're playing the same   upper right. And we're playing the same game of adding up averages. But nothing game of adding up averages. But nothing   game of adding up averages. But nothing in this diagram has substantively in this diagram has substantively   in this diagram has substantively changed. It's essentially the same thing changed. It's essentially the same thing   changed. It's essentially the same thing we were just looking at. The only we were just looking at. The only   we were just looking at. The only difference is that now that special difference is that now that special   difference is that now that special value where explosion happens and we see value where explosion happens and we see   value where explosion happens and we see a pole is at s= 1.5 instead of s=0. a pole is at s= 1.5 instead of s=0.   a pole is at s= 1.5 instead of s=0. Symbolically, a little bit of Symbolically, a little bit of   Symbolically, a little bit of rearrangement shows that this key rearrangement shows that this key   rearrangement shows that this key integral is almost identical to the one integral is almost identical to the one   integral is almost identical to the one we were just studying. The only we were just studying. The only   we were just studying. The only difference is that s has been replaced difference is that s has been replaced   difference is that s has been replaced by sus 1.5. So the new result that we by sus 1.5. So the new result that we   by sus 1.5. So the new result that we can write down and circle is that the can write down and circle is that the   can write down and circle is that the transform of our exponential function transform of our exponential function   transform of our exponential function looks like 1 / s - 1.5. looks like 1 / s - 1.5.   looks like 1 / s - 1.5. And of course there's nothing special And of course there's nothing special   And of course there's nothing special about 1.5. I can replace this with any about 1.5. I can replace this with any   about 1.5. I can replace this with any constant a. And if there is only one constant a. And if there is only one   constant a.

The final step to fleshing out that idea is final step to fleshing out that idea is   final step to fleshing out that idea is to convince oursel that this works for to convince oursel that this works for   to convince oursel that this works for combinations. As an example, let's pull combinations. As an example, let's pull   combinations. As an example, let's pull back in our good friend, the cosine of back in our good friend, the cosine of   back in our good friend, the cosine of t. And here we have two options for how t.

We can think it through symbolically and then after for fun, symbolically and then after for fun,   symbolically and then after for fun, let's plug it into that same visual let's plug it into that same visual   let's plug it into that same visual machine and see what it looks like. machine and see what it looks like.   machine and see what it looks like. All right. So symbolically as we All right. So symbolically as we   All right. So symbolically as we discussed earlier a cosine can be broken discussed earlier a cosine can be broken   discussed earlier a cosine can be broken up as 12 ei.       What you can do next from here is break What you can do next from here is break   What you can do next from here is break this outer expression into two different this outer expression into two different   this outer expression into two different pieces. One that looks like half * the pieces. One that looks like half * the   pieces. One that looks like half * the transform of e to the i it and another transform of e to the i it and another   transform of e to the i it and another which looks like half * the transform of which looks like half * the transform of   which looks like half * the transform of e to the negative i. In the lingo, the e to the negative i. In the lingo, the   e to the negative i. In the lingo, the way that you would phrase this is that way that you would phrase this is that   way that you would phrase this is that the lelass transform is linear. Meaning the lelass transform is linear. Meaning   the lelass transform is linear. Meaning if you have a scaled sum of some stuff if you have a scaled sum of some stuff   if you have a scaled sum of some stuff on the inside, you can break everything on the inside, you can break everything   on the inside, you can break everything apart to the same scaled sum of the apart to the same scaled sum of the   apart to the same scaled sum of the transforms of those inner parts. In our transforms of those inner parts. In our   transforms of those inner parts. In our case, because we just saw how to take case, because we just saw how to take   case, because we just saw how to take the transform of simple exponential the transform of simple exponential   the transform of simple exponential functions, this whole expression here functions, this whole expression here   functions, this whole expression here can be collapsed to look like 1 / s - i, can be collapsed to look like 1 / s - i,   can be collapsed to look like 1 / s - i, a thing with a simple pole at i. And a thing with a simple pole at i. And   a thing with a simple pole at i. And then this whole expression can collapse then this whole expression can collapse   then this whole expression can collapse to become 1 / s plus i, a thing with a to become 1 / s plus i, a thing with a   to become 1 / s plus i, a thing with a pole at negative i. So when you read pole at negative i. So when you read   pole at negative i. So when you read this whole expression, the sum of two this whole expression, the sum of two   this whole expression, the sum of two fractions, the image that should pop fractions, the image that should pop   fractions, the image that should pop into your head is a plot with two into your head is a plot with two   into your head is a plot with two different spikes above i and negative i. different spikes above i and negative i.   different spikes above i and negative i. And in fact, if we have a little fun and And in fact, if we have a little fun and   And in fact, if we have a little fun and we try plugging the expression cosine of we try plugging the expression cosine of   we try plugging the expression cosine of t e to the negative s t into that big t e to the negative s t into that big   t e to the negative s t into that big complex integrating machine that we complex integrating machine that we   complex integrating machine that we built up, you do indeed see a plot that built up, you do indeed see a plot that   built up, you do indeed see a plot that has poles above i and negative i. This has poles above i and negative i. This   has poles above i and negative i. This time the diagram is notably more time the diagram is notably more   time the diagram is notably more complicated. And if I'm honest with you, complicated. And if I'm honest with you,   complicated. And if I'm honest with you, the symbolic reasoning is probably the the symbolic reasoning is probably the   the symbolic reasoning is probably the easier way to understand the final easier way to understand the final   easier way to understand the final answer.

Although we won't dig into the Laplace transform itself until the next two chapters, everything that we cover here sets up the mental frameworks and the prerequisite knowledge that make understanding that transform as easy as I know how. This video is a lot more than just preamble, though. It's a very fun lesson in its own right about how one of the most famous equations in all of math is enables a bizarre trick for solving an equation that is used ubiquitously throughout physics. The main characters throughout this chapter and the next two are exponential functions, and I'm always going to be writing these as e^(st). Here we think of t as being time and then s as just some number determining which specific exponential we're talking about. One of the big aims of this video is to motivate using physics why it's useful to give s the freedom to take on not only real number values, but complex ones as well. But wait a minute, what does it even mean to shove a complex number into an exponent? Here I imagine there's a bit of a divide in the audience. You see, there's some regular viewers of math videos online for whom the specific case of plugging in π times i is a little bit cliched by this point. It is amply covered by many videos on YouTube, but on the other hand, most students find this to be an understandably baffling notion. Given how absolutely fundamental this is to everything that follows, even if you fall into that first camp, I hope you'll agree that it's worth kicking things off here by reviewing a very beautiful and visual way to understand what this idea is all about. The nice part is that what follows doubles as a gentle warm up for visualizing and thinking about differential equations. You start with the fact that e to the t is its own derivative. And really, you should think of this as what defines the number e. Exponentials with other bases will have derivatives that are proportional to themselves, but e is the special number such that that proportionality constant is 1. Now, very often in a calculus class, you visualize derivatives as slopes of graphs. That's all well and good, but it's not the only way. You should get in the habit of flexing your mind a bit more. For example, let's say you think of this as telling you the position of some point on the number line as a function of time. Then what the derivative expression is telling you is that at every moment the velocity vector must look identical to the position vector. And more specifically, because you know that e^0 equals 1, anything to the 0 is 1, you also have an initial condition. It's telling you you start at the number 1. So at the very first moment, the velocity is also 1, meaning it's pointed to the right. But the farther to the right the position gets, the faster it must move. So even if you had never heard of the function e^t or exponential growth, this property alone is enough to give you a very visceral feeling for how it gives a value that grows and at an accelerating rate. But what if there was some constant in that exponent like e^(2t)? Well, by the chain rule, the derivative is then two times the function itself. And reading this dynamically, it's telling you the velocity vector is always two times the position vector. Again, the farther to the right the position gets, the faster it must move. But this time the feeling is that that growth gets out of hand all the more quickly. What if that constant was negative, say negative 0.5? Well, once again, by the chain rule, the derivative of this function is minus 0.5 times the function itself. So at every moment in time, that velocity vector looks like a 180 degree rotation of the position vector, but scaled down to be half its length. This means you start moving to the left, but as you approach zero with a smaller position vector, that velocity must get proportionally smaller. So it approaches zero, but at an ever slowing pace. This, of course, is exponential decay. But now for the fun part, why we're here in the first place. What if that constant was an imaginary number i, the square root of negative one? Again, the chain rule tells us that the derivative of this function is going to be i times the function itself. Geometrically multiplying by i acts like a 90 degree rotation, so this is telling you velocity always has to be perpendicular to position. For anyone who's a little bit rusty or needs a quick review with complex numbers, let's say you have an arbitrary complex value a + bi, which you typically draw in the 2D plane. Like this, the easiest way to think about multiplying by i is to go component-by-component. a times i ends up on this vertical imaginary line. And then bi times i is b(i^2), which is -b. This is where you actually use the defining property of i. You'll notice each of those two individual components is rotated 90 degrees. So the sum as a whole also has to get rotated 90 degrees. Looking back at the equation, where this time, evidently we must be thinking about position as being in the complex plane. Even if you had never heard of raising e to an imaginary number, and even if it's not clear at first what that would actually mean, the expression is telling you that this value has to move in such a way that the velocity vector is always locked to be a 90 degree rotated copy of the position vector. The only motion that satisfies this criterion is rotation around a circle, and you can be more specific because the initial position is 1, that velocity vector always has a unit length. So this tells you how fast you have to move. Your point wanders around that circle in such a way that it traces one unit of arc length for every unit of time. For example, to get one of the most famous equations in all of math, if you wait for π units of time, you end up precisely halfway around the circle. This is why e^(πi) is -1. One thing that's always worth emphasizing to any students initially confused by this expression is just how misleading the notation is. When you input a complex value, the expression really has very little to do with repeated multiplication, and honestly, not that much to do with the number e. The computation that it refers to is plugging in the input into this infinite polynomial, the Taylor series for e^x. It's actually very fun, I think, to take a moment to interpret the literal meaning of plugging in something like π times i for each one of these polynomial terms. As you take a higher power, each extra factor of i rotates you another 90 degrees, and then the π^n / (n!) terms initially grow, but then they shrink as that denominator takes over, and you end up with this spiraling sum that converges to minus one. Now, that said, it is not at all obvious, just looking at this infinite polynomial, that if you change the value t in the expression e^(i*t), you're going to end up walking around a unit circle. This is why focusing on the property of being its own derivative is a lot more helpful than focusing on the underlying computation. In practice, people get used to using the expression e^x as a notational shorthand here, and really think nothing of it. Throughout this lesson, I'm going to be pulling up a complex plane representing possible values for this number s. And for each point on this plane, I want you to be able to think about the corresponding exponential function e^(st). We were just talking through what happens when s is equal to i. On the lower right I can show you how that output changes with time. And then on the top right, I might show a graph where, in order to fit it on the screen, I'll typically only graph the real part of that output with respect to time. In this case, it looks like a cosine wave. If s is a different imaginary number, something like two i, it means you rotate at a different rate. And on the one hand, this is obvious. Throwing in a 2 in front of the time obviously moves you twice as fast. But again, I think it's kind of fun to read what the derivative expression is telling you dynamically. In this case, you can read it as saying the velocity is always a copy of the position vector rotated 90 degrees, but stretched to have a length of 2. More generally, it's common to label this imaginary part with the Greek letter omega, which describes the angular frequency of the motion. In other words, how many radians of arc length does it traverse around the circle per unit time? This is just the imaginary axis. But what about when s has both a real and an imaginary part? Something like minus 0.5 plus i. On the one hand, you can split up the exponential, and this part here is telling you that the magnitude decays over time. And then this part is telling you that there's rotation. That's all well and good, but for fun, another way that you can think about it is to continue with the previous intuition. To understand what multiplication by any complex number looks like, you can ask what combination of rotation and stretching would place the vector at 1 onto this new value s. For this example here, that would look like rotating a little over 90 degrees and stretching it out a bit. So the derivative expression is telling you this is always the relationship between the position and velocity vectors. And I think geometrically, this gives you a very visceral way to see why the motion must be spiraling inwards. You'll sometimes hear engineers refer to this as the S plane, and which essentially means you should think of each point on that plane as encoding the entire function e^(st). The imaginary part of s is always telling you how rapidly the function oscillates and in which direction. And then the real part of s is telling you whether the magnitude grows or shrinks. Positive real parts corresponding to exponential growth, negative real parts corresponding to exponential decay. This key equation telling us that velocity is some modified version of position. Is basically a differential equation. And for you and me, having just seen how an intuition for reading off a differential equation like this can explain what complex exponents mean, at least if you want e^x to retain its core property. Let's flip this around to get back to our core question and see how a different set of differential equations can motivate why you would ever care about complex exponents in the first place. The easiest case to show you what I mean by this is a very central example used all throughout physics, where you imagine having a mass on a spring. We're going to describe the position of this mass as x, which will change over time. The value 0 is going to correspond to the equilibrium position. The derivative of this position versus time function, of course, gives you the velocity of that mass. And then the second derivative, the rate of change of the velocity, gives you its acceleration. The key feature of this spring setup is that the more you pull that spring to one side, the more strongly it accelerates the mass towards that equilibrium position. More specifically, we say that the force which is equal to mass times acceleration, that's Newton's second law, is often well approximated as k times the position. K here is just some positive proportionality constant. It tells you how strong the spring is. And this whole equation is telling you force is proportional to position. Now, the reason this example is used all throughout physics is because there are lots of other situations where you approximate a force and being proportional to some kind of offset. Often it's not exactly that, but as a first order approximation, it really helps you model what's going to happen. It's also common to include a term here proportional to the velocity. We call it a damping term. This Greek letter mu is representing another positive coefficient. And the negative sign is telling you the faster this mass is moving, the stronger that damping force. Maybe you think of it as friction, maybe you think of it as air resistance. I remember as a physics student, always being bothered by the fact that neither friction nor air resistance actually behave like this. But the better way to view it is that, again, this is a first order approximation of whatever the slowing forces might be on this mass. The point is, we now have a differential equation. The position over time is an unknown function, but we know it has to adhere to this constraint. And your physical intuition probably tells you loosely what you expect the solution to look like here. There's going to be some oscillation back and forth, and then as it loses energy to whatever those damping effects are, the amplitude of that oscillation is going to decay. I'm going to go ahead and take this equation and move everything to one side of it so that we're setting a bunch of stuff equal to zero. As a quick reminder, with differential equations, there's not one specific function that solves it, per se. For different initial positions where this mass might be, you're going to get distinct functions that also solve the equation. And that's actually only one out of two free parameters that we can change here, because all of these are solutions where the initial velocity is zero. But you could also imagine that the mass starts out with some other non-zero velocity, and every one of these combinations of an initial position and initial velocity corresponds to a distinct function that also solves the equation. So to solve this, really you're looking for a family of functions that solve it. And preferably, you'd like some way to be able to narrow down which member of that family solves it for your specific initial conditions. So how do you solve it? Well, there's this one very bizarre trick which I remember really bothered me when I was a calculus student who first saw it, which is where you simply guess that the answer looks like e^(st), where s is just some constant, something that you're going to solve for. The reason this really bothered me is that guessing and checking like this sort of just feels like asking the student to know the answer ahead of time. And also your physical intuition is telling you that an exponential is probably not really how this mass on a spring behaves. And yes, this is, frankly, unsystematic. But the point I want to make is that a desire to make this trick more systematic and more generalizable is going to be one of the things that leads you and me to the Laplace transform. Right here, let's just run forward and see what it gives us. If that position versus time really did look like e^(st), then when you take its derivative, you. You get the same function, but by the chain rule, you multiply it by s, and then the second derivative again looks like the same function, but it's picked up another factor of s. And then all of the other constants just kind of come along for the ride. What's very nice here is that you can factor out that e^(st), and now everything that depends on time is tied up in this term right here. And moreover, exponentials will never equal zero. So if this equation is going to be true, it means that this part right here has to equal zero. So what you're left with is a piece of algebra. Solve this quadratic equation, one that looks kind of like a mirror image of the original differential equation that we had. The easiest case here is if we ignore that damping coefficient. Basically setting mu equal to zero with a little bit of rearrangement and taking a square root, what you find is that s is going to be plus or minus the square root of -k/m. Now, k and m are both positive numbers, so that means, whether you wanted it or not, i, the square root of negative one, has now entered the game. This square root of k/m term is something that I'm going to give the suggestive shorthand name omega. And rolling back, remember what it is that s represents. We were exploring the possibility that a solution to this equation looks like e^(st). If we plug in these values for s, you now know what that means. Plugging in a purely imaginary term like this corresponds to oscillation in the complex plane. Now, on the one hand, that is very weird because obviously our mass on a spring needs a real valued solution, not these complex functions. But on the other hand, the idea of oscillating kind of matches what you want to find. And it matches it quantitatively too. Imagine that you increase that value k, meaning you have a stronger spring. Well, then omega goes up. So that corresponds to faster oscillation. And your physical intuition backs that up. A stronger spring probably would give you faster oscillation. Even still, the result, frankly, feels bizarre, if not obviously nonsense. I mean, the position of the mass on a spring is clearly a real number. And if you zoom out, really what's going on here is that we found for the pure mathematical equation divorced from any physics, there exists a complex valued function that solves it, namely e^(i * omega * t). To connect this pure mathland answer to something that's actually physical, you need to squeeze out a real valued solution from this. And the animation on screen kind of gives you one indication of how you could do this. You could just ignore the imaginary part, only consider the real component of this solution that does actually work. But a better way to think about it, which will line up with the overall story I want to tell here that navigates towards Laplace transforms is to add up the two distinct complex solutions that we just found. When you add these rotating vectors tip to tail, the result stays constrained to the real number line. And in fact, the way that it oscillates on that number line over time looks like the function two times the cosine of that same frequency term times T. Now, the reason that you're allowed to just add two different solutions like this to get another solution is based on a critical property of our equation. It's what we call a linear equation, which means if you have two distinct functions that solve it, then when you add up those functions, that sum of the two functions also solves the differential equation. And actually you have more flexibility than that. If you scale each one of those functions by some constant and you add them up, that scaled sum is also a solution of the equation. Remember, in solving an equation like this, we're not just looking for one function or even two functions. We're looking for a family of a whole bunch of solutions that will depend on the initial conditions. In this case, when we tried our admittedly random looking guess, and the math came back to us with two distinct functions because it's linear, you can scale each one of those functions by some constant, add them together, and get a valid solution to the equation. And those scaling coefficients don't have to be real numbers. Those could also be complex numbers, which in this case affects the initial angle of each of those rotating vectors. The family of all possible functions you can get by tuning these two coefficients is the family of all possible solutions to the original equation. And most of these solutions are complex valued functions. But the real valued solutions are a special case of those. And which one you want depends on the initial conditions. For example, if the initial position is supposed to be 2 and the initial velocity is supposed to be 0, then you get a valid answer by setting both of these coefficients to be 1, basically meaning you're just adding the two solutions we found earlier. If the initial position is something different, then you simply scale both those constants by the same amount. Now, as presented so far, if this is supposed to be an example of why complex exponents are a natural and desirable thing, one of you could rightfully complain. This is all just needlessly complicated! If the so-called strategy is to just guess some function with a free parameter, it's not like it's hard to guess for this situation that a cosine or a sine would solve the equation, and you could have that frequency term be the free parameter that you're solving for. What you would find if you knew to make this guess, is that either cosine or sine can totally solve this equation, as long as you set that frequency to be the square root of k over m. And then, just as before, because this is a linear equation, you can get the full family of solutions by scaling both of these and adding them together. And this is another valid way to describe the family of solutions. Essentially, we're describing it with an alternate coordinate system. And you could argue this is a way more sensible coordinate system to use when we care about real solutions. Because in this case, all the real solutions are what you get simply by setting those scaling coefficients to be real numbers. Isn't this just way more sensible? Why complicate things with complex numbers? The value of putting exponentials front and center makes itself clear as soon as we try to generalize things. So far, when we solved for s, we got these two different values in the complex plane that are constrained to the imaginary line. And as you change what the constants k and m look like, you end up with different imaginary values that for your solution, correspond to distinct frequencies in the oscillation that you get. But think about what it means if we reintroduce that damping coefficient mu, setting it to something that's not equal to zero. Well, in this case, solving the equation looks like applying the quadratic formula. And you don't really need to dwell on the details of the algebra here. I'm just going to go ahead and show you what it looks like if I increase the value of that coefficient mu, and we see where the two corresponding solutions for S land in the complex plane. The salient feature is that they have not only an imaginary but also a negative real component. And just a few minutes ago, we talked all about what it looks like if you want to exponentiate something with a negative real part and an imaginary part, it both does decays and oscillates, where the real part tells you how much it decays, the imaginary part tells you how much it oscillates. In this case, what I'll do is graph for you the real component of that exponential, and it kind of matches what you would expect of the spring. One thing that's actually pretty fun here is how if you increase that damping coefficient mu enough, eventually the solutions no longer have any imaginary part and they only have a real component, meaning the solution just looks like decay. And when this happens, you call the spring overdamped. This whole example is called the damped harmonic oscillator. Like I said, it's very fundamental throughout physics, so just understanding it in its own right is a worthy enough task. But how far does this dumb little trick actually take us? The straightforward way that you can generalize it is for any equation that looks like this, where you're taking a bunch of higher order derivatives, you're scaling each one by some constant, you add them all up, and you set the result equal to zero. In that case, everything we just did works essentially the same way. If you substitute e^(st) for x, then all of these derivative terms look just like that, but each one picks up an additional factor of s. This lets you factor out all of the exponential parts, leaving you with a certain polynomial in s that you want to equal zero. One of the most fundamental facts in algebra, literally called the fundamental theorem of algebra, is that polynomials can always be factored into linear terms like this, exposing n roots to the equation, as long as you give those roots the freedom to maybe take on complex number values. So, for example, if this was some fifth degree equation, your solutions might look something like this in the S-plane. Just like the oscillator example, this is basically the math telling you, hey, e^(st) can absolutely be a valid solution as long as you set s equal to one of these values. And just as before, this is a linear equation. So you can find the family of all solutions by scaling each one of these exponentials and adding them together. All of these constants are like knobs and dials that you can tune to your heart's content. They can be real or they can be complex, allowing them to influence both the amplitude and the phase of each term. The specific values will depend on your initial conditions. I am glossing over a certain nuance when it comes to repeated roots, but this is the general idea. Unfortunately, most real world equations are not simple linear ones like this. For example, the equation for a damped harmonic oscillator has actually come up on this channel before in a video about optics, but it came with a twist. We were studying why light appears to slow down in a medium like glass, causing it to refract. And the key question was to understand why this depends on the color of that light, giving the effect of a prism. Now, I'm not going to recount all the details here, but what you need to know is that deep in that video, we were modeling charges inside the material, like glass, as little damped harmonic oscillators. These little charges wiggling about some equilibrium position, were being influenced by an external force, in this case, an incoming light wave, which oscillated up and down as a sine wave. And critically, the frequency of that incoming light would in general have nothing to do with the natural resonant frequency of the oscillator. So, in short, we were studying the same equation, but with this added term that looks like a certain cosine expression. Now, unlike the linear case, the family of solutions here does not look as simple as a linear combination of exponentials where you can freely tune all of those constants to your heart's content. And this dumb trick of just guessing e^(st) certainly is not going to work. However, everything that we've discussed here does actually bring you a lot closer than you might expect. The solutions in this more complicated case do happen to look like a combination of four specific exponentials. It's just that, unlike the linear case, you can't freely tune all of the coefficients. It's a lot more constrained. In fact, the whole substance of that prism example comes down to understanding exactly how big these coefficients are as a function of that incoming light frequency. This is a surprisingly common outcome where the solutions to some differential equation that pops up in the real world looks like a certain combination of exponentials, but with particular coefficients. This ubiquity of exponentials is why engineers benefit from an intuitive understanding of points on the S-plane and how they can encode growth, decay, and oscillation. You can kind of think about these functions, e^(st) as being like the atoms of calculus. What I mean by that is that complicated functions that describe our world can often be broken up into these parts. And as long as you give s the freedom to take on complex values, and by breaking it up that way, they become simpler to understand and to study. This becomes especially true if you allow for infinite combinations, potentially over a continuum of values for s rather than some discrete set. We're going to go deep with that idea, and it is hard to overstate how powerful it is. The key question is, given some unknown function and a differential equation describing it, even if you assume it can be broken up into exponential parts like this, how do you actually find what those parts are? Taking the forced harmonic oscillator, for example: How would you know that the solution is built out of four specific exponentials? How would you solve for the appropriate values of s in the exponents? And how would you solve for the corresponding coefficients for a particular initial condition? There is a tool for this job, and as you may have guessed by this point, it's something known as a Laplace Transform. If you watched the earlier chapter about Fourier series, a lot of what I'm saying here is probably ringing all kinds of bells: Imaginary exponentials as describing a kind of rotation breaking up general functions as a sum of those rotating exponentials. And there is absolutely a connection here. A big part of the story I want to tell is how this Laplace transform we are building up to extends the notion of Fourier series and Fourier transforms, applying to a much more general family of functions. We're going to go into much more detail in the next two chapters, but here's a high level preview. When you use a Laplace transform to solve a differential equation, it actually ends up looking remarkably similar to that dumb trick of substituting e^(st). In the context of our dumb trick, the differential equation turned into algebra basically because the act of taking a derivative is the same as multiplication by s, at least for these specific functions. That same thing happens when you use a Laplace transform, and it's for essentially the same reason too. What that operation does is translate functions into a new language where these terms e^(st), the atoms of calculus, are the fundamental units. Then again, the fact that differentiation in time looks like multiplication by s for these terms means that in this new language, derivatives start to look a lot like multiplication, and differential equations start to look like algebra. To see how exactly this transform is defined, how you can visualize what it's doing, and how to use it to concretely solve a nonlinear equation, come join me in the next chapter. At the time I'm publishing this, an early view for that next chapter is available on Patreon, and my plan is to incorporate the feedback and get a finalized version out by next week. See you then."
